#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.I attended the extraordinary European Council in Brussels on 1 September 2008 which was convened to discuss the crisis in Georgia.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin.  The European Council strongly condemned the Russian Federation's unilateral decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and reiterated its support for Georgian territorial integrity and sovereignty.The European Council also welcomed the six-point agreement achieved on 12 August 2008, on the basis of the European Union's mediation efforts, that led to a ceasefire, improved delivery of humanitarian aid to the victims and a substantial withdrawal of Russian military forces.  It indicated that the EU would be willing to contribute to an international monitoring force as outlined in the six-point plan.  This was confirmed in the agreement reached on 8 September between Presidents Sarkozy and Medvedev, which also called for talks on the situation to commence on 15 October.  The EU has fulfilled its commitment under that agreement to have a monitoring force on the ground in Georgia by 1 October and I am pleased that Ireland has been able to provide four personnel to assist that effort.The talks inaugurated in Geneva on 15 October 2008 under the joint auspices of the EU special representative for the crisis in Georgia, Mr. Pierre Morel, and the OSCE and UN are a welcome development.  These talks are aimed at achieving a peaceful and sustainable resolution to the conflict.  Sessions were held on 18 and 19 November and on 17 and 18 December 2008, which achieved some progress on issues related to security and the humanitarian situation of those affected by the conflict.  A fourth session is scheduled to take place on 17 and 18 February next.An international donors' conference took place on 22 October 2008 in Brussels which brought together 71 countries and delegations.  The conference was opened by Commissioner Ferrero Waldner and the president of the World Bank, Mr. Satso, in the presence of the Prime Minister of Georgia, the French Foreign Minister, Mr. Kouchner, the Czech Foreign Minister, Mr. Schwarzenberg, and the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso.  The total amount pledged at the conference was €3.6 billion.  I am pleased that Ireland was able to pledge €2 million in development assistance for Georgia from 2008 to 2010.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, visited Georgia from 19 to 21 November 2008 to assess the situation on the ground.  He had meetings with the Georgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and also met with the Irish monitoring team of the EU monitoring mission.

When one considers that it concerns an issue that was then a crisis, the conflict between Russia and Georgia, one sees that it is necessary to do something about how these questions are selected for reply.The EU responded quickly and effectively to the Georgian crisis.  Much of the credit for that must go to President Sarkozy who responded very quickly.  Can the Taoiseach tell us why the European Union was not able to respond as quickly or as effectively to the crisis in Gaza?  When Russia engaged with Georgia, the Union was able to act quickly, deal with the situation and get a result.  Israel launched an assault and invaded Gaza and the European Union seemed absolutely powerless to do anything about it.  A total of 1,300 people are dead and there is major destruction in the area.  Is there any way to explain why there was effective action in Georgia and no action worth talking about in Gaza?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I agree with Deputy Gilmore about the timing and tabling of questions.  It is open to Members to withdraw questions when such time has passed that they are no longer urgent.  It would help us get through questions more quickly if they were topical and contemporaneous.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Any change in that area would be more than welcome.In response to the Deputy's supplementary question, one of the benefits of the Lisbon treaty is the proposal for a more permanent representation at the highest levels of the Union for a longer time.  The Union very quickly had people from countries which have influence in that region in situ.  These include the French President’s initiative with President Mubarak.  Several Prime Ministers, including Ms Merkel, Gordon Brown and the Italian Prime Minister, were in attendance at the announcement of the ceasefire arrangements, which indicated that there was significant European interaction with the Palestinians, the Egyptians, the Israelis and others to bring the situation, which has had tragic consequences, quickly to a halt.  This highlights the benefit of a more consistent approach.  A permanent president of the European Council, for which the Lisbon treaty provides, would give us the coherence and continuity that we expect, and which is needed, when life and limb are at risk and the EU’s influence can be of great benefit.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I agree with the Taoiseach regarding the need for continuity in the EU response to issues like this.  When a crisis happens, the level of action taken depends on the status or authority of the head of government of the member state holding the EU Presidency.  How does the Taoiseach now see relations between the EU and Russia, following the crisis in Georgia?  I refer in particular to the recent difficulties that have arisen with the supply of gas to countries outside of Russia.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The most recent difficulties point to the importance of the EU-Russia relationship in strategic terms.  The dependence on gas from that part of the world is quite significant in the context of the EU's energy needs in the coming decades.  Any bilateral problems which arise — in this case, between Russia and Ukraine — have had consequences for the supply to others, including new members of the EU and countries in the Balkans.President Barroso made the point in the European Parliament that the contracts of those other third countries who are not involved in the dispute need to be respected in all circumstances.  The relationship between Russia and the EU is not helped by incidents where the heating needs of millions of people were put at risk for weeks due to a bilateral problem between Ukraine and Russia.  The President of the Commission was very clear that the legal obligations to EU countries should be respected and that their contractual arrangements with Russia need to be upheld, regardless of the supply issues that arise between Russia and Ukraine.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The Taoiseach might be surprised to hear that I agree with him.  He responded to Deputy Gilmore on how we in this House should be in a position to have far more effective structures.  We could start by having longer periods of Dáil sittings.  If the Government Whip brings forward proposals to change the way we do business in the House, he will find support from members of the Opposition.The Taoiseach made the point that the Lisbon treaty was a conduit for Europe having a single voice in international affairs.  During the French Presidency of the EU, President Sarkozy brought this to a new level.  In the context of having a single voice, has the Government decided to hold a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  Was that discussed at the summit in the context of strengthening Europe?  Has the Taoiseach been in touch with the Government of the Czech Republic about the declarations being drafted?After the Georgia fracas, the EU suspended talks with Russia on a long-term partnership agreement.  This was to be reviewed by the Commission on 10 November and I understand the European Foreign Ministers began discussions again on 2 December.  Does the Taoiseach's report include a briefing from the European Commission on relations between the EU and Russia?  Can he give the House an update on those relations following the resumption of talks on 10 November and 2 December last?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	9	No, I do not have that detail.  This question relates to the specific meeting that was held on the Georgia question.  As I said in my initial reply, a series of meetings was arranged, arising from that initiative, to ascertain whether this matter can be resolved peaceably.  The EU envoy, Mr. Morel, represents the Union's interests in those continuing discussions.  The Deputy also raised the possibility of holding a further referendum.  He is aware that everything depends on the concerns of the Irish people on taxation, defence and ethical and social issues, including workers' rights, being addressed to our satisfaction as our partners have promised.  The question of revisiting the ratification process remains firmly in our own hands.  I have consistently said that no decision has been taken yet.  We have committed ourselves to seek to ratify the treaty before the end of the term of the current Commission if we are satisfied when the detailed follow-up work has been completed.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs took the opportunity to meet the Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic at yesterday's meeting.  He discussed the logistics of what we are engaged in with them.  We are working on detailed texts that have to be submitted to the legal services section of the European Commission.  If the Commission is satisfied with them, the matter will be taken up with the Czech Presidency at that stage.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I thank the Taoiseach for that reply.  Following the generosity he showed in the last conversation we had about this matter, can I express the hope that he will keep the leaders and relevant spokespersons of the various Opposition parties fully briefed on these matters?  As he is aware, Fine Gael strongly supports the Lisbon treaty, the endorsement of which is absolutely necessary if the European Union is to be strengthened.  The concerns of the Irish people should be the subject of the strongest possible protections.  I hope the Government will keep Opposition Members fully informed.All economic analyses reckon that Russia's massive reserves of oil and gas will help it to move into the top ten over the next 15 years.  Its difficulty with Ukraine is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of many western European countries.  I was present at a meeting in Brussels at which the President of Ukraine mentioned that Ukraine wants to join the EU at some point.  It certainly wants to do business with Europe.  If some unforeseen circumstance were to lead to gas supplies from Russia being cut off and energy security becoming even more critical — God forbid — what level of strategic reserves would this country be able to call on?  What would our position be if such a possibility came to pass?  Does the Taoiseach propose to engage in discussions with his European counterparts to move this agenda forward quickly?  It is intended that the Lisbon treaty will guarantee energy security for all EU member states, which is something we would strongly support.  The evidence in this country makes that absolutely critical.  It should be a priority of the Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The scope of this question has moved from Abkhazia and South Ossetia to west Mayo, in the Deputy's constituency.  The recent decreases in the price of oil and other major commodities are causing serious budgetary problems for the Russian Federation, which is a major supplier of such commodities to many parts of the world.  The Deputy's supplementary question relates to this country's strategic reserves.  If he wants an accurate response, he should table a detailed question to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I assure him that the Government's continued commitment to the development of an interconnector, as part of a wider North-South and east-west energy region, is an important aspect of its energy policy.  In addition, the increased reliance on renewable energy sources — with a target of 40% of the island's energy supply coming from renewables by 2020 — will offer a major strategic advantage in terms of security of supply for the future.  The ability to bring gas onto our own shore, in the Deputy's constituency, will also be of great benefit, and we hope that can happen as quickly as possible.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I agree with the Taoiseach that several of the points made have moved away from the central focus of the three questions tabled.  That is a mistake.  I hope the Taoiseach will be in a position to advise us of the continuing efforts being made by Ireland, the European Union and other influences to address the ongoing strained relationship between Georgia and Russia.  The fact that this issue is not featuring prominently in our print media and broadcast reportage does not mean the problem is done and dusted.  Far from it.Does the Taoiseach agree that the potential for further renewed tension and even conflict between Georgia and Russia is very real and that the situation is far from resolved?  Does he agree that much of the backdrop to this strained relationship is the relationship now enjoyed by Georgia as an ally of the United States and the direct participation of significant numbers of Georgian troops in the US war in Iraq?  Does the Taoiseach further agree that there is understandable concern in Russia at the intent of Georgia to secure membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, and that Russia, as a major nuclear power, has real and understandable concerns at the advent of another nuclear power on its borders?Will the Taoiseach outline whether these matters, including the role of NATO and its proposed expansion, were addressed in the course of the EU summit on Georgia?  What position, if any, has the Government taken in urging an ongoing address of the situation there, recognising that it is through negotiation that a peaceful resolution may be secured, which is far preferable to the emergence of conflict once again, which I all too sadly add is as predictable as it was inevitable as it presented during 2007?  Rather than relaxing, we should be doing more to guarantee there is peaceful coexistence between these two neighbouring nations.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	13	One of the fundamental tenets of compliance with international law is respect for the territorial integrity of every country.  Regardless of the view taken by the Russian Federation or anybody else of the application for NATO membership by Georgia, it does not entitle any country to invade that territory.  By the same token, the decision by the Georgian President to send Georgian troops into Abkhazia and South Ossetia at a time when there was a difficulty in terms of the autonomy being sought by those two regions for their own purposes, enabled the situation to develop where the Russian Federation responded in the way it did.However, ultimately, the basic principle must be respect for the territorial integrity of every country.  The tactical mistakes or errors that were made, which brought about the situation with which we now have to contend, does not take away from that fact.  From the European Union's point of view, it is that perspective that will inform, in the main, the policy position the Union will take on this matter.With the conflict having taken place, the need for people to withdraw, abide by the six point plan and to find some sort of a political perspective in which this issue might be resolved for the future was the right approach.  Taking a proactive diplomatic effort to arrange for a ceasefire was also a positive role the Union played.  However, I do not believe that the background to all of this, the policies being pursued by one country vis-à-vis another, or the other country’s view of those policies entitle any country, however powerful or big, to take it upon itself to intervene in a way that compromises the territorial integrity of the country concerned.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	14	We are in agreement on that, historically and contemporarily.  However, that does not take away from the fact that far from the situation being resolved, the potential very much exists once again for an emergence of a re-inflamed situation between Georgia and Russia.  The major contributory factor, I believe, may well prove to be NATO's intentions of expansion further east.The new relationship between Georgia and the United States demonstrates clear intent on the part of its current political leadership.  It has indicated its interest and willingness to become a part of the NATO alliance.  That aspect, which is like the elephant in the room in regard to this equation, is a backdrop to the relationship between these two countries, which we cannot ignore.  It does not excuse any unilateral action on the part of the Russian Federation, nor does it excuse any of the actions it has demonstrated during the course of the past year.  Given the importance of addressing the situation there in order to put in place a more permanent and preferably a permanent resolution of the difficulties between these two states, I ask that this matter not be ignored.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if it has been addressed?  Will he indicate if he proposes to address it within the context of further EU engagement on this matter?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The EU is trying to facilitate talks between the parties concerned to see if this matter can be resolved to everyone's satisfaction peaceably and in line with international norms.  The only point I would make to the Deputy is that a country having a dim view of another country applying for membership of an international organisation, to which it does not or has no intention of subscribing, does not justify the action that was subsequently taken in terms of the territorial integrity of that country being compromised.  Large countries are not entitled to determine spheres of influence around which other independent countries must behave to a certain norm that is suitable to the large country.  It must be based on mutual respect.Independent countries are entitled to pursue their own foreign policy objectives as they see fit once they do so peaceably and within the norms of international law.  It may not help the relationship between two countries in that respect that one country is pursuing one particular security path with which the other does not agree, but it does not entitle the more powerful country to decide to interfere in the internal politics of the smaller country.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	17	No, I have not addressed it.  I have many other issues to address.

If it is part of the talks that are taking place, that is fine.  I am giving the Deputy my view of it and what I believe the Government's view should be, should the matter arise.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.I attended the commemoration ceremony on Friday, 15 August, held to mark the tenth anniversary of the Omagh bombing.  The ceremony, organised by Omagh District Council, was a moving tribute to the victims and their families and to the emergency and medical services who assisted on that terrible day.  At the new memorial garden I laid a wreath on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland in remembrance of those whose lives were taken.  Later, I had an opportunity to meet briefly with the families, and I expressed my solidarity and that of the Government with all of those affected from the town and the wider community.  Both ministerial colleagues and I have received correspondence from the relatives about their concerns.  However, I have not received a formal request for a further meeting.The Government noted the contents of the "Panorama" programme and also the Prime Minister's announcement of 17 September last when he asked Peter Gibson, Intelligence Services Commissioner, to report on the matter. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, had also raised the allegations from the "Panorama" programme with the Secretary of State, Shaun Woodward.  The Gibson review has been completed and the conclusions of the report have been published.The Garda Síochana maintains close contact with the Police Service of Northern Ireland regarding all matters of cross-Border crime, including the investigation into the Omagh bombing.  As criminal proceedings continue in this jurisdiction in connection with the bombing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail.There is also a civil case ongoing in Northern Ireland.  That case has heard evidence in the South and has also heard evidence from the Garda.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.I am sure the Taoiseach will recall that in the immediate aftermath of the Omagh bombing, emergency legislation was introduced in both jurisdictions.  Statements were made to the effect that no stone would be left unturned until those who had committed the atrocity were brought to justice.The unfortunate reality is that nobody has been convicted of the bombing per se.  There have been a number of suggestions about how matters might be progressed.  One suggestion, made by the families of the Omagh bomb victims, is that a cross-Border inquiry might be initiated.  I understand that proposal has the support of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland.  There has also been the suggestion by the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission that a judge of international standing should be appointed to review all the available material in connection with the bombing.Does the Taoiseach support either of those suggestions?  How does he see an inquiry into the Omagh bombing being reconciled with the Eames-Bradley proposals?  These are largely to the effect that no further inquiries should be undertaken in respect of the Northern Ireland atrocities.A second issue relates to the "Panorama" programme.  The Taoiseach said that the conclusions of the report of the Intelligence Services Commissioner had been published.  However, as I understand it, all that was published were the summary conclusions of that report.  Has the full report been made available to the Government?  If not, is the Government seeking the full report of the Intelligence Services Commissioner?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	22	With regard to the second matter, as the Deputy said, the conclusions of the Gibson report, which were published last week, do not support the allegations made in the "Panorama" programme that at the relevant time vital intercept evidence which might have prevented the bombing or help bring the perpetrators to justice was not passed sufficiently promptly to the police.  That was not the finding of the Gibson report when it looked into those allegations.  As the report deals with intelligence matters within the British system, it is subject to legal constraints.  On that basis, I do not expect we will receive a full copy of the report.With regard to the Eames-Bradley proposals, I understand they have yet to be presented formally.  There was talk in the media during the week as to what the content may be but the proposals have not been formally published, or that was certainly the case earlier this week.  Until such time as we have it and give it proper consideration, comment by me would not be helpful.Clearly, it is a very difficult area, as Deputies know.  Both Mr. Bradley and Archbishop Eames are held in high regard.  They have obviously put a point of view arising from all of their consideration of the matter.  There have been various comments on the reported contents of the report, and based on some of those comments, it may not meet with full support.  However, it is best to await the publication of the report to see exactly what it says.  I understand the report runs to 160 pages, covering such themes as the legacy of the past, reconciliation, support for victims and survivors, addressing society issues and justice and information recovery.  As I said, a more detailed response would be preferable when the report is received.Regarding the question of a cross-Border body, it is not something we propose to set up.  I fully understand the continuing hurt and suffering of the Omagh families and the pain the people of Omagh have felt, which is as deep as it was at the time of the atrocity.  We have had a number of trials and investigations on both sides of the Border and there is still a criminal case before the courts here, on which it would not be appropriate for me to comment, I am advised.  A civil case which the families have taken is also ongoing.  We have been able to see gardaí giving evidence, and we have heard evidence in the South on that issue.  The question of whether a further review of all the evidence, in addition to what the Ombudsman at the time and others reported on, would be of greater benefit than concentrating on the criminal case that is still ongoing, is an issue that can be considered with regard to whether it would add to the situation or not.I know this is a very difficult situation for the families and I do not want anything I say to be interpreted in any way as being less than sympathetic to them, but all of these various cases have been and are being taken in an effort to bring the perpetrators to justice, which, at the end of the day, can only be done through the criminal law.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	23	As an aside to this question, I suggest the House should congratulate Senator George Mitchell on his appointment as special envoy to the Middle East.  His experience in Northern Ireland, his brilliant patience and his grasp of detail will stand him in good stead in what is an exceptionally difficult situation.  I hope he takes the opportunity to visit Ireland on his frequent travels across the Atlantic when dealing with his new responsibility.As we are all aware, ten years ago the Real IRA bomb killed 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins.  I understand six families have taken a STG£14 million civil case against five men they believe were responsible for this atrocity.  Lord Brennan, who represents these families, has said this is the first time that civilians have confronted terrorists in the courts, which from the families' point of view, as private citizens, is an act of courage.Did the Taoiseach raise with the British authorities the issue of the release of surveillance evidence to the families?  As I understand it, the surveillance evidence that is available to the British authorities could be used by the families in the civil case they are taking against those they believe perpetrated this atrocity.  If the Taoiseach did raise the matter with the British authorities, what sort of response did they give him?  This evidence and these tapes were raised by at least a dozen cross-Border members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in October 2008.  Will the Taoiseach give an update on what has happened and the current position in this regard?  The Real IRA was responsible for that bomb.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on the actions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who made representations about Mr. McKevitt following receipt of a letter?  He said that he was duty bound to have compassion and empathy.  The same Minister did not show compassion and empathy to the families of the Omagh bomb victims when he refused to apologise to them for the distress caused by his action.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on this matter?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I have not raised the matter of surveillance evidence with my counterpart.  If a question is put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the relevant line Ministries may be able to shed further light on that matter.Regarding the second matter, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made his position clear.  It should not be misrepresented in any way, or suggested that he is in any way ambivalent about actions of violence or people who perpetrate violence.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I did not wish to express any ambivalence.  The point I made was that he expressed compassion and empathy arising from a letter and he refused to apologise to the families.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have shown equal compassion and empathy for their plight and should understand the stress and the serious concern expressed by them arising from his actions.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Does the Taoiseach not agree that all the information now before us is compelling and, as the families of the victims and the survivors have called for time and again, that a fully independent all-Ireland public inquiry into the events that led up to the bombing and the subsequent investigation should be carried out?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the body of evidence supporting such a call must include the exposure in the BBC "Panorama" programme, to which he referred, of the role of the UK Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ, surveillance operation on mobile telephones used by the individuals involved in the transportation of that device or devices on that day?  Does the Taoiseach accept that there are clear and strong indications that the people responsible were heavily infiltrated by British and other intelligence agencies?  Does he accept that there is a question mark regarding the failure to make an intervention prior to the bombing, and the quality of the investigation that occurred subsequently?Questions have been posed by victims, survivors and others, covering all opinion, regarding whether there were other factors in the consideration of those given responsibility to investigate the Omagh bombing, for example, the protection of information trails and informers within the ranks of those involved in carrying out that terrible atrocity on that day.  These matters can only be properly investigated and answered through the setting in place of a fully independent public inquiry on an all-Ireland basis, for which the families concerned have called, because of all the information shown.  Does the Taoiseach accept that this is the case and will he agree to the request in the interest of the achievement of truth and justice for the dead, the survivors and the victims' families?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The way justice is achieved for the families is to bring the perpetrators to justice.  That is the purpose of criminal law, procedure and investigation.  That is the issue.  There is still a criminal case before the courts relating to this matter.  The Garda will continue to work with others to establish in what way it can bring the perpetrators to justice.  The contention or idea that the forces of law and order are less than anxious to do so, or in any way not committed to trying to do so, would be to take away from the efforts that must be made.I am aware that members of the Judiciary and others have made statements on, or referred to, the investigation or various aspects thereof in the course of several criminal trials that have been held before the courts.  Ultimately, however, the Garda and those under our jurisdiction will continue to work in every way they can to ascertain whether they can successfully bring a prosecution in this case.  This is the real means by which the perpetrators of this terrible crime can be brought to justice.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The situation in Zimbabwe remains dire.  The country effectively has not been governed since March 2008 and after years of mismanagement and neglect, its infrastructure appears to be in terminal collapse.  Inflation continues unabated and those in power have found no better response than to print ever larger bank notes, the most recent of which was a 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar note, which then quickly lose their value.  Millions of Zimbabweans are dependent on food aid and on what friends and relatives can send them from abroad.  One of the most tragic symptoms of the failure of governance in Zimbabwe is the ongoing cholera epidemic, which is estimated by the World Health Organisation to have cost more than 2,500 lives.  Those who protest against this state of affairs and against the abuse of human rights risk arrest and there are reports that some of those in custody, including Ms Jestina Mukoko, may have been tortured.Discussions last week between President Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai resulted in no further progress towards the establishment of a power-sharing government, as agreed in principle last September.  The central issue remains the allocation of key Ministries between ZANU-PF and the MDC.Zimbabwe's neighbours, who have the greatest capacity to exert influence in this troubled country, bear the greatest responsibility to exert pressure towards a solution.  The extraordinary summit on Zimbabwe held yesterday by the Southern African Development Community, SADC, outlined a formula for the formation of a unity government by mid-February, with Mr. Tsvangirai to become Prime Minister on 11 February.  However, despite claims that this was agreed by the MDC, there is considerable doubt over whether this is in fact the case and the MDC council is to meet at the end of the week.  There seem to be few grounds for confidence at present that the arrangements proposed will provide a basis for progress towards a meaningful resolution to the current crisis.Although the collapse of the Zimbabwean economy and the isolation of the Mugabe regime mean that unfortunately, EU leverage is limited, we are using every avenue open to us.  At the General Affairs and External Relations Council yesterday, my EU colleagues and I formally renewed the EU's targeted restrictive measures against individuals and businesses that have supported or participated in the destruction wrought by the Mugabe regime.  We also added new names and a number of companies to the list.  We are determined to target the regime's finances, that is, the revenues used to support the lifestyle of the elite, to keep the security services on its side and to cushion Mugabe and his cronies from the economic catastrophe they have created.The European Union continues to provide humanitarian support to Zimbabweans and to press for greater involvement by SADC or the African Union in the mediation process.  Yesterday, we reconfirmed that the EU stands ready to support the economic and social recovery of Zimbabwe once a government is formed that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people and which returns to respect for human rights, the rule of law and responsible macroeconomic management.

As the Minister noted, an agreement for power-sharing was signed last September between ZANU-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change but that agreement was broken by Mr. Mugabe in a dispute over the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs.  In light of the deaths from cholera of almost 3,000 people since August 2008 and the dependence of almost half the population, 5 million people, on food aid in Zimbabwe, what can we in Ireland actually do?  A certain number of individuals have had sanctions imposed on them and I note that number was increased recently by the European Union.  However, this is not good enough and there appears to be general acceptance that this is okay.  Has the Minister had discussions with the South African ambassador recently?  If not, will he summon the ambassador and outline the dissatisfaction people in Ireland have regarding the lack of progress towards a resolution?Does the Minister have a view on why the South African Development Community, in a statement yesterday, stated that a new government would be signed-up to on 11 February when it is clear that Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai and the Movement for Democratic Change had not signed up to it?  What forces are at play here?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I agree with Deputy Timmins's concern and anger at the situation in Zimbabwe.  We have conveyed our concerns directly to the governments of key partner countries in Africa and, most recently, in December, the Irish ambassador to Zimbabwe, who is based in Pretoria, communicated Ireland's strong views to the Zimbabwean ambassador there.  I have made my views personally known to the South African ambassador in Dublin and they are well aware of our views.We believe it is at EU level that we can leverage the maximum influence.  However, the problem is of course that while we have sanctions against named individuals and companies which are targeted at those who are propping up the regime, in essence it is the considered view of the EU partners that ultimately it is the regional partners who can exert the greatest degree of influence on, and exact the leverage over, President Mugabe.We are not satisfied with the SADC approach to date.  It seems to us that yesterday an attempt was made to force the MDC and Tsvangirai into a position to accept what was on offer.  We are not entirely comfortable with that approach.  We are not confident that the formula outlined, particularly in terms of the portfolios that the MDC would get, would be a sustainable and viable proposition for good governance in Zimbabwe.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	34	There is a real humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and the last thing we want to do is take action or initiatives that would exacerbate the suffering of ordinary people.  Therefore, that is not a route we will go down.Our trade with Zimbabwe is minuscule and the economy has collapsed.  As I mentioned, the cholera outbreak provides an opportunity and an avenue through which stronger international intervention could be considered, particularly in terms of the significant health epidemic that is taking place there.  Ultimately, the real leverage is at the regional level and in our view, the main regional actors have not acted in a way that they should.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 102 together.The war in Gaza, arising from the launch of Operation Cast Lead by Israel on 27 December 2008, was a profound tragedy for the people of Gaza and for the region.  I welcome that the unilateral ceasefires announced by Israel and Hamas on 18 January continue to hold.  The costs of the war have been stark — 1,300 Palestinian dead and over 5,500 severely injured, with more than 40% of the victims women and children.  Much of Gaza lies in ruins, with extensive destruction to homes and public infrastructure and utilities throughout the territory.The immediate imperatives are the delivery of humanitarian relief to the population of Gaza and the consolidation of the current fragile cessation into a durable truce through the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1860.  Following the halt in rockets launched into Israel and the withdrawal on 21 January of Israeli troops from Gaza, the crossings into Gaza must to be reopened and a mechanism developed to prevent arms smuggling into Gaza.The conflict witnessed a number of appalling incidents and alleged violations of international humanitarian law by both parties.  I have already made clear that I agree with and fully support the call by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon for these incidents to be fully investigated and, where evidence of violations of international humanitarian law is adduced, those responsible should be held to account.I believe that there is a case for an independent international investigation and I made clear my position to EU Foreign Ministers on Monday last.  Among the incidents which require to be properly investigated are the shelling of UN schools and facilities, with attendant heavy civilian casualties, including children; attacks on humanitarian convoys and the deaths of humanitarian and medical personnel; reports of the parties using civilians as human shields; and the use of white phosphorous by the Israeli military.  I note that the Israeli Government is to set up an investigation into allegations against its defence forces.  At a minimum such an investigation would require the involvement of independent international experts if it were to have any credibility.  No investigation needs to be conducted to prove that Hamas, in its indiscriminate shelling of southern Israel, violated international law.Looking forward, and in order to move away from the grim cycle of violence which has too often characterised the region, the search for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East must be the diplomatic priority for the international community.  In general, the US has endeavoured to play a constructive role in supporting the efforts of the parties to reach a settlement.  At the same time, the nature of American support for Israel has, at times, impacted upon the perception, and arguably the reality, of the role of the US as a neutral or honest broker.  However, the US remains an indispensable partner for peace in the Middle East.I am very much encouraged therefore that President Obama has promised that his Administration will "actively and aggressively" pursue Middle East peace and that he will invest time, political capital and finance in the effort.  I also warmly welcomed the appointment of Senator George Mitchell, a true friend of Ireland and a masterful mediator, as an inspired choice to serve as President Obama's Middle East envoy.  Ireland and our EU partners look forward to working closely together with Secretary of State Clinton and Senator Mitchell in a renewed transatlantic effort to promote what Europe and America recognise as the strategic priority of a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement.Following this crisis in Gaza, it is more critical than ever that the Palestinian and Israeli people can have faith in a revived and credible political process that is seen to be addressing the underlying causes of the conflict, ending the occupation and leading to a two-state solution.  However, no comprehensive peace is possible without intra-Palestinian reconciliation and the political reunification of Gaza and the West Bank, and I support the efforts of Egypt and other regional actors to promote such reconciliation.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I am grateful for the Minister's reply, and I note and welcome the distinction between the Irish position and the position of the European Union.  Yesterday's meeting of the general affairs and external relations Ministers must be regarded as not only disappointing but as irresponsible in its failure to reach a conclusion to support international law.There are restrictions on what supplementary questions I might ask.  I might put it like this.  The European Union has a clear duty in international law, as have its member countries as third parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, to see that there is compliance with international law on the protection of civilians.If the European Union was being even-handed, as it could be, it could have looked at breaches of international law by both sides, such as the rockets at Sderot associated with the military wing of Hamas and then, most particularly, the material presented by a distinguished Irish citizen, Mr. John Ging, the person to whom I referred in my question, when he supplied in advance the co-ordinates of schools which were hit some 11 days later.  UN installations were hit not once but three times.  This was first denied but when caught out the story was changed.  This was a major breach.  I believe the Minister agrees with me on that.However, the equivocation at EU level is appalling.  The Presidency issued a statement that it preferred Israeli courts to international law.  It was totally silent on the issue of the duties of an occupying power or of compliance with the Geneva Conventions.  In addition, four or five countries have canvassed for no criticism at all.I appreciate that the Union is divided and I appreciate the Irish position, but it is time to be very open about it.  Why did the meeting not end the discussion on deepening the trade agreement if it was sincere?While I do not have time to go into all of the details, the time has come for the European Union to be an actor of first instance.  Reverting to the Quartet would be nonsense.  Is recognition of the state of Israel, which is one of the Quartet's three demands, to be de facto or de jure?Regarding the final part of the Minister's reply, how will there be a reconstruction of Gaza if the administrative authority, the non-political wing of Hamas, is not talked to?  How can reconstruction stemming from the large bidding conference on 28 February occur if the opening of the crossings has not been secured?  The meeting was a disaster in terms of its moral failure and its cowardice in the defence of children and civilians.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	37	At the EU meeting, I made it clear to my colleagues that, as far as I was concerned, the EU has a duty to international law.  It must also be consistent, since we cannot set criteria and standards for other countries and condemn and criticise them at will while remaining mute in respect of other conflicts, particularly in the Middle East.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Yes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	39	On the other hand, the EU condemned the attack on UNRWA unequivocally in its statement and conclusions.  I detected a shift at the meeting.  As the Deputy knows well, there are different perspectives in Europe because countries have different approaches to this issue historically.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Different dishonest relationships with the region.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Our Sunday meetings with the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Norway and Turkey were particularly interesting and useful in terms of moving matters forward a little, starting with a durable truce and ceasefire.  Currently, there are two unilateral ceasefires, but a sustained period of quiet is necessary, which would facilitate the opening of the crossings.Intra-Palestinian reconciliation is important if the reconstruction of Gaza is to be facilitated and humanitarian aid is to enter it.  If a mechanism involving Palestinian consensus can be established to facilitate that reconstruction, the clear message from our Arab colleagues is for Europe not to close the door or to be absolutist this time and for it to adopt a flexible approach to what may emerge from the Egyptian negotiations.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Like Deputy Higgins, I was disappointed by yesterday's meeting in Brussels.  History has shown that no political problem can be resolved militarily.  Any attempt using excessive force only creates a new breed of terrorist.  The situation is volatile.  This morning, two people were killed.  We do not yet know whether this incident has broken the ceasefire, but the Israeli Minister for Defence, Ehud Barak, has stated that he is willing to use force again.Does the Minister plan to meet the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, regarding her new job and her special relationship with Ireland?  Senator George Mitchell, who is on his way to the Middle East as we speak, has a major task in hand.  He has a good record of conflict resolution.  He is meeting a number of prime ministers and other interested parties, but should he also meet Hamas during his discussions?  Irrespective of whether one likes it, Hamas is a significant part of the problem and has been recognised by the Palestinian people.  Fatah is not as popular as it was.  Some damage was done to the President, Mahmoud Abbas, because of his support for Israel at the start of the conflict.  The EU and the Americans should make a considerable international effort and work together on a resolution to the conflict.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	43	We will meet the Secretary of State in due course.  Indeed, we have written to congratulate her on her appointment and to offer any assistance.  I have also written to George Mitchell to congratulate him on his appointment and to offer any assistance or advice that Ireland can give, considering our history of conflict resolution and the noble role that he played in assisting the peace process, which led to the Good Friday Agreement.  He is an experienced mediator and is not new to events in the Middle East.  He is fully aware of the different approaches to various parties.  The main game in town is the Egyptian process and the sets of negotiations in which the Egyptians are engaged.  Senator Mitchell, who is in the Middle East this week, will take cognisance of the process and talk to all of the major players.The question on Hamas was fair.  During the EU meeting, it was raised by a number of Foreign Ministers.  In our situation, people who were outside the mainstream of political opinion, such as those in the Sinn Féin movement, took a lengthy period before they entered the political discussions.  Events had to occur beforehand.  They did not occur by accident.  People needed to change their positions and sequencing, mutual understanding and so forth were required.  All of these constitute the delicate art of peace building and will be required in the Middle East.Hamas must also move.  It cannot stay rooted.  Seeking ways to bring Hamas and others into the political mainstream, to have it renounce violence and to enter a process that offers a genuine two-state solution, would be worthwhile.  There must be a sincerity behind the process.  This is the creativity that Senator Mitchell and others will bring to the table.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I will make it brief.  When Mr. John Ging stood alongside Ban Ki-moon in front of burning humanitarian aid in the UN compound, the UN Secretary General's request was that those responsible be brought to account.  Nothing I have heard suggests that they will ever be brought to account.  While I would welcome the Minister's strong position, an admission that the EU will not bring such people to account would be helpful.  In that light, its credibility in respect of international humanitarian law would be damaged.I have visited Gaza and travelled through the crossings as late as 2005.  How is humanitarian relief to be brought into Gaza while the discussion continues if the crossings are closed?  This shows the absolute nonsense of events at the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC.  It is time to expose the military members of the EU who will not condemn outright the actions that are in breach of international law.  In the case of the British, they are afraid of such condemnation being invoked against themselves in some of their military actions elsewhere.  These are facts.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Does the Minister agree that the Northern Ireland situation is slightly different from the Middle East's?  The IRA wanted the British out of Northern Ireland.  It did not want to take over London.  The Hamas situation is entirely different.  Will the Minister briefly outline what steps the EU took at the recent meeting concerning the prevention of arms smuggling into Israel?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	47	When I spoke to Mr. John Ging of UNRWA on the morning after the attack on his headquarters, he told me about something that smelled and looked like white phosphorus.  He gave me the co-ordinates and so on.  In my opinion, the UN is the ideal vehicle to instigate an investigation.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Yes, but it may be vetoed on the Security Council by the United States.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Mr. Ban Ki-moon has changed his position slightly from that as articulated earlier by the Deputy in that in the immediate aftermath of the event, he condemned it and asked that people be taken into account.  That position appears to have been modified somewhat.  In my view, his position is as articulated in the response to the parliamentary question.  I believe the UN is the vehicle through which this matter should be investigated.  If not, another mechanism must be devised that is external to Israel and is independent enough to follow through the investigation.

There is increasing frustration among EU member states that despite the fact that the ceasefire was announced approximately ten days ago, the crossings are not yet open to facilitate access to humanitarian aid.  Different countries are having different experiences in terms of facilitating the evacuation of children who require surgery and so on, which is unsatisfactory.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	55	We must move on, Minister.  We are well over time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I am not saying Northern Ireland is the same as the Middle East.  I never said that.  We have always been careful to say that no one conflict situation is directly comparable to another.  However, there are similarities in terms of peace building generally and in terms of the principles of resolving conflicts, which requires movement and the development of mutual respect on all sides before a political settlement can be put together.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	57	As the Deputy will be aware, on 22 January, President Obama signed four Executive Orders concerning the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and related matters.  I warmly welcome this decisive and immediate move by the President.  As I said in my immediate reaction to the news, it represents an historic new beginning in efforts to uphold and promote human rights and will be welcomed by all friends of the United States.The relevant Executive Order states that Guantanamo is to close within one year and that appropriate arrangements will need to be made to deal with the remaining detainees either by prosecuting them, returning them to their home countries, releasing them or transferring them to a third country.  The Executive Order directs the Secretary of State to seek international co-operation aimed at achieving the transfers of detainees.Ireland, with our EU partners, has consistently called for the closure of Guantanamo and the bringing to trial or release of detainees held there.  At yesterday's meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, Foreign Ministers held an initial discussion of how European Union member states might approach the issue and strongly welcomed President Obama's move.  It is, however, clear that there is a range of complex legal, practical and political issues to be worked through, primarily on the US side in the first instance.  Nevertheless, I made clear that Ireland is ready in this new context to examine how we may be supportive of the United States Government as it proceeds towards the closure of Guantanamo.While any decisions on resettlement are for each member state to take individually, a co-ordinated EU approach would be highly desirable.  With the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whose Department has responsibility for the reception and integration of citizens of third countries, I will keep the matter under review and, as necessary, will bring any specific proposals to Government.  While there have as yet been no approaches from the new US Administration on the matter, I expect that it will feature in our future dialogue with it.There were some discussions last year with the US authorities at official level in my Department and in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the possible acceptance by Ireland of detainees.  Also, informal contacts with interested parties and lawyers representing one of these detainees have taken place.  However, given President Obama's decision last Thursday, the context has clearly changed.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Fine Gael welcomes the proposed closure of Guantanamo, which it always believed was a bad concept.  I watched with interest European countries adopt the high moral ground during the past number of years in respect of Guantanamo.  One would have thought at one stage that all the detainees had been former Reverend Mothers.  The chickens have come to roost in terms of the EU's duplicitous approach in respect to Guantanamo.What contribution did the Minister make to the discussion on this issue?  We seem to be waiting in the wings on Europe.  While we hear much of the need for one voice in Europe, member states are now taking different positions on this issue.  My understanding is that the Portuguese sought to put the item on the agenda at a late stage.  Perhaps the Minister will state Ireland's position in this regard and will outline why approximately 70 or 80 detainees cannot return to their home countries.  What was our position to the General Affairs and External Relations Council with respect to Ireland agreeing to accept detainees?My understanding is that one of the Government parties, the Green Party, has actively sought to have a particular detainee brought here.  What is the Minister's response to this matter?  I am sure he is in a position to make a unilateral decision in this regard and does not need Mr. Miliband or President Sarkozy to tell him what to do.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The issue was discussed formally over lunch yesterday at the EU Council Meeting.  Considerable debate on the issue took place for quite a long time.  Deputy Breen is correct that the Portuguese Foreign Minister, Luis Amado, circulated correspondence on the matter to all member states requesting that the issue be discussed.  The issue is not one of whether a country takes one detainee or a number of detainees.  Freedom of mobility means such persons would be free to move to other European countries.  There is a strong European dimension involved.  Member states have different legal systems.  As the discussion unfolded, it became clear that there were significant issues involved in terms of freedom of movement, different legal systems, relocation to third countries and so on.  It was decided to await a paper on the matter from the Commission which would analyse all of the issues raised.  The Americans have stated that Guantanamo will be closed within one year.We await engagement on the matter from the Americans.  The position is as I stated yesterday, we welcome the decision to close Guantanamo.  This decision represents more than just the closure of Guantanamo; it represents a new commitment to a more multilateral approach and an engagement with the EU and other global powers by the United States and the new President.  We will co-operate and work with the US in facilitating the closure of Guantanamo.  However, we must wait to see what track that takes in the coming months.

Is it his view that we should accept that detainee?Also, will the Minister state if he intends to visit Cuba shortly.  During the silly season, the Minister mentioned a proposed visit to Cuba and perhaps he might outline the position in this regard.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	63	On the Deputy's key point, each member state has the right to make its own decision in respect of detainees.  Britain has already taken 12 detainees, all British citizens, from Guantanamo and will shortly take in two more.  The Belgians took in two detainees in 2006.As regards the particular detainee referred to, informal discussions took place last year with the individual's lawyer.

We are examining the matter.  It was agreed at yesterday's meeting that more detailed work was required before people would take unilateral action.  It must be pointed out that President Obama has not, as yet, requested anything of us.  Undoubtedly, there will be further discussions on the matter.  President Obama said it will take a year to close down Guantanamo.  Three categories of prisoners have been identified.  We have made clear that we will not accept people with terrorist backgrounds.  There is no need to rush the fences today or tomorrow; we can work through this issue.Question No. 102 answered with Question No. 100.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Under an over-arching motto of "Europe Without Barriers," the Czech Presidency will focus on the economy, energy and the European Union in the world.  Under the external relations umbrella, the Czech Presidency has identified three key priorities: the eastern partnership, transatlantic relations and Western Balkans-enlargement.  The eastern partnership, which is part of the European neighbourhood policy, is a key Presidency priority.  The Commission's communication of 3 December will form the basis for the Czech Presidency's efforts to move this initiative forward.On Kosovo, the main task for the incoming Presidency will be to ensure that, following initial deployment of the EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, EULEX, on 9 December, it will be in a position to focus on the full implementation of its mandate.  The Presidency will prioritise the accession negotiations with Croatia, which is aiming to complete its negotiations by the end of 2009.In addition to addressing the issue of energy security, the Czech Presidency will have an important role to play in shaping the Union's continuing response to current extremely difficult global economic conditions.  These events have underlined the value of European nations working closely together under the EU umbrella in order to protect our many shared interests.I particularly look forward to co-operating with the Presidency in taking work forward on the legal guarantees on the Lisbon treaty committed to Ireland by the December European Council in response to concerns that surfaced during our referendum campaign.  It is important that we finalise these guarantees to our full satisfaction in the coming months.  The Czech Presidency is a fitting way to mark the 20th anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet system.  I wish the Czech Government well for its Presidency and expect that it will discharge its responsibilities in an effective manner.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I am aware that the economy, energy and external relations are the key themes.  However, I am surprised that the Minister has managed to gloss over the economy, which is probably the most pressing issue of direct relevance to this country.  I have noted that the Czech Presidency has laid particular emphasis on the role of the EU in enhancing competitiveness, and I have some questions in that regard.  We have seen emphasis over the past ten years or so as regards the Lisbon strategy and improving and enhancing competitiveness across the EU.  I wonder whether any particular developments are envisaged in that regard, because this is now of major concern to the Irish people.In addition, under the economy heading, a good deal of emphasis has been laid on the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  As I am sure the Minister is aware a package, known as the "Small Business Act", which is a series of proposals on reducing regulation and making it easier for SMEs to operate in the EU, is of major concern, both for the Irish and the European-wide economies, and is being emphasised, it appears, by the Czech Presidency as well.   I wonder whether there are concrete proposals in that regard.  I asked the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, about this last autumn, but bizarrely, she did not even seem to have heard of it.  Are there any specific proposals on credit flows for SMEs under that package?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The major package on the economy was the one agreed at the December Council, initiated by the French Presidency, namely, the economic recovery plan, which was an over-arching framework for providing a stimulus to EU economies.  In the Irish context the more than 5% investment in capital infrastructure, which will take place in 2009, represents our economic stimulus package on the economy.  It is double the rate of most of EU states in terms of capital spend.  In terms of the development of small to medium-sized enterprises, we have been very active, for example as regards the implementation of the small business forum, that I established about two years ago when I was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This comprised SME entrepreneurs along with the agencies in devising a blueprint for the development of small business, such as the provision of venture capital,  and facilitating access to business agencies, funding and so on.The European Investment Bank as part of the EU's reaction to the current economic crisis, provided substantial funding through loan facilities.  It is up to the banks in member states to avail of the EIB package to assist credit flows to SMEs across the European Union.In terms of the Czech Presidency, the ECOFIN Council will deal primarily with the economic side, while GAERC will deal, mainly, with the foreign affairs agenda and——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	70	No, that is not correct.  It will deal with the other dimensions, such as energy, which we dealt withyesterday.  There is a key emphasis on energy infrastructure because of the Ukraine-Russian crisis.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	71	As regards the energy flow, in particular, we urgently need to see a reduction in our dependence on Russia.  That was particularly highlighted over the Christmas period, given the crisis in eastern Europe, which clearly will have a knock-on effect if we do not reduce our dependency.  Perhaps the Minister can enlighten the House as to whether there are any proposals or developments in that area.On the priority being given to Croatian accession, does the Minister intend to impose the same restrictions on free movement of Croatian workers, in the event, as are at present in place for Bulgaria and Romania?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	72	In terms of the energy situation, clearly the issues that arose between Russia and Ukraine had severe impacts on quite a number of EU member states.  In a spirit of solidarity all member states are very concerned at what transpired, in terms of the commercial and economic disruption as well as the inability of both countries to live up to their contractual responsibilities in terms of the delivery of gas to EU member state customers.  That has highlighted the need to diversify in terms of energy.In the context of the economic recovery plan, a range of energy infrastructure projects are under discussion, relating to inter-connection and the improvement of energy supply and so forth, which would facilitate a better and more diversified energy situation.  That is under active consideration by the Commission as we speak.As regards Croatia, once the terms of an accession treaty have been agreed, the Tánaiste, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will bring recommendations to Government as regards how that particular matter will be dealt with.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The peace process in Nepal has continued to progress since the elections of April 2008 and the establishment of a federal democratic republic to replace the monarchy.  I welcome the recent agreement reached by the political parties on arrangements for the drafting of a new constitution.  Likewise, the recent efforts by the Nepalese Prime Minister to ensure the return of property seized during the civil war and to end the activities of paramilitary groups represent an important and welcome development.However, long-term stability is far from being achieved in Nepal.  Public discontent is mounting and the rule of law remains weak. Violent clashes have recently taken place between the Maoist Young Communist League and rival members of the Unified Marxist-Leninist, UML, youth force, which are both associated with government coalition parties.Journalists critical of Maoist conduct have also been threatened with, and subjected to, violence from Maoist trade unionists.  It remains imperative that all sides continue to respect pluralism and the rule of law, and work towards securing the political consensus needed to complete the peace process.A central element of the peace process which remains incomplete is the integration of Maoist army personnel into the Nepalese army.  I welcome the first meeting of the special committee tasked to oversee this which was held on 16 January.  However, the reports of recruitment being undertaken by the Nepalese army, which is in contravention of the 2006 ceasefire agreement, are of concern.  It is vital that all sides comply with agreed commitments on this issue and work towards a speedy resolution of it.Ireland is accredited diplomatically to Nepal through our ambassador in New Delhi.  Our embassy there monitors developments in Nepal closely and remains in regular contact with parties there, including the Nepalese Government.  Ireland's ambassador-designate to Nepal will travel shortly to Kathmandu to present credentials and he will take this opportunity to engage in political consultations with the Government and other parties and interests and to convey our views and concerns while he is there.  The EU is also actively engaged in Nepal and deployed an election observation mission to monitor the elections in April 2008, to which Ireland contributed.  Likewise, the UN Mission in Nepal, UNMIN, plays a vital role in facilitating the peace process.  Ireland remains fully supportive of its work.In 2008, Irish Aid provided funding of over €1.1 million to civil society organisations for development activities in Nepal.  Ireland also responded to the serious flooding in Nepal through a contribution of €89,000 to Plan Ireland for immediate relief to displaced families.  In addition, €15,000 was provided towards the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in support of the Nepali peace process.

There is no power in Kathmandu for 16 hours a day, and no water.  The population has just emerged from a two-week garbage strike and the country is in chaos, with problems of child trafficking, child slavery and refugees.  Nepal is very low down on the scale and Sri Lanka is not too far from it in that regard.  Unfortunately, we will not reach questions regarding the situation there.  I ask the Minister to instruct the new ambassador designate to New Delhi to ask the Indian Government to use its influence on the area to try to bring some stability to Nepal.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	75	While I fully accept the Deputy's points, some progress has been made politically.  The constituent assembly has chosen a President and Prime Minister and formed a coalition Government.  It now has to work on drawing up a permanent constitution for Nepal.  We will work and communicate the Oireachtas's views to the Indian Government on the role it can play.  We will also work directly with the authorities in Nepal to see if we can be of further assistance in helping build up civil society and proper governance structures there.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Does the Minister consider that it would be useful, through the ambassador in New Delhi, to follow on the €1.1 million we spent through the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights by seeking opportunities there for assisting with the human rights mechanisms such as the Human Rights Commission, writing a constitution and bringing into existence institutions of civil society?  Our assisting in that would be an opportunity for some once-off relationships with the Nepalese Government.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Yes.  The EU plays a very significant role in Nepal.  The EU engagement centres around three focal areas, education, stability and peace building.  It has allocated €60 million to funding projects that address these issues.  We have had some criticism of the EU today but it is equally important to point to where it plays a positive role.  The statistics about the humanitarian situation there are extremely grave.  Its child malnutrition rates are among the worst in the world.  Approximately 8 million Nepalese continue to live at or below the poverty line.  There was an appalling rise in food prices last year, which compounded that.  Approximately 2.7 million depend on food assistance.  There are very serious and severe issues and through Irish Aid we will do what we can with the authorities in New Delhi and elsewhere to try to make our contribution to alleviating some of the horrific poverty people endure there on a daily basis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 109, 138 and 150 together.At its meeting of 11-12 December, and following intensive negotiations, the European Council agreed that the concerns of the Irish electorate regarding the treaty of Lisbon, as identified by the Taoiseach, will be addressed to the satisfaction of Ireland and of the other member states, including through the provision of legal guarantees in a number of key areas.The report of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in Europe provided a very valuable input in helping to inform the Government's position ahead of this meeting, and made a significant contribution in enabling us to secure such a positive outcome.  Once again I thank the Members of this House, and of the Seanad, who served on the sub-committee for their excellent work, which will be of continuing value in our ongoing discussions on Lisbon treaty issues during the Czech Presidency.The European Council agreed that if the Lisbon treaty enters into force, each member state will continue to have the right to nominate a Commissioner.  It agreed that legal guarantees will be given to Ireland in the areas of taxation, defence and sensitive issues covered by our Constitution, namely the right to life, education and family.  It also agreed that the high importance the EU attaches to issues including workers' rights and social services will be confirmed.  In response the Government said that conditional on the satisfactory completion of the detailed follow-up work necessary on these commitments by mid-2009, and on presumption of their satisfactory implementation, it is committed to seeking ratification of the treaty by the end of the term of the current Commission, which is expected to leave office at the end of October.The Government will be working domestically, with our EU partners and with the EU institutions to give full effect to the commitments contained in the European Council conclusions.  This will involve intensive consultations in the months ahead.  We will be looking to finalise the required legal guarantees before the end of the Czech Presidency, which will hold two meetings of the European Council in March and in June.  We will not take any decision on the holding of a second referendum until the concerns of the Irish people have been addressed to our full satisfaction.With a view to advancing this work, we have already had a number of meetings with the Czech Presidency.  After yesterday's GAERC meeting I met my Czech counterpart, Mr. Karel Schwarzenberg, and Czech deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Alexandr Vondra, who also has responsibility for European affairs.  Earlier this month, my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, attended an informal General Affairs Council meeting in Prague, where he also had meetings with the Czech Presidency.  At an official level, my Department is in regular contact with partners, including the Presidency.The Government believes it will be possible to secure the robust legal guarantees we require to address what have been identified as the most significant areas of public concern regarding the Lisbon treaty.  Once this has been achieved, we are committed to seeking ratification of the Lisbon treaty through a referendum later this year.  We will do all in our power to ensure a clear, comprehensive and inclusive national debate on the ratification of the treaty and on Ireland's future in Europe.  This is a matter of the highest national importance.  I look forward to all individuals and parties in this House who are committed to upholding Ireland's position within the European Union playing a full and active role in this vital national debate whose outcome will shape our future in Europe.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I am very pleased to hear relations between the Irish Government and the Czech Presidency have improved since the visit of the Czech President to the country a few months ago.  I welcome some of the steps taken regarding the key issues highlighted in the aftermath of the Lisbon referendum.  For those of us on the ground these matters were highlighted during the campaign.  These relate to concerns on social and moral issues, taxation, etc.  It is important we seek and guarantee assurances at EU level on those.I am disappointed at the lack of progress at a domestic level.  I have said before and  I repeat, there is a large amount of groundwork to do at a domestic level.  A number of recommendations in the report of the Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union have not in any way been implemented.  I thank the Minister for his kind words on the work of the sub-committee, but words are inadequate.  We need to see some action on some of these proposals, such as those on the scrutiny reserve system, a new approach to the oversight of statutory instruments and the role of Oireachtas Members.  Some of this will require domestic legislation and I have seen no evidence of any preparation of this.  I would like to hear precisely what is happening at Government level to seek the changes we require at domestic level.  We do not need the agreement of our European partners to take the necessary steps at a domestic level.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I am disappointed with the tone of the Deputy's remarks because the Oireachtas committee's report was published at the end of November.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Exactly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	82	We then led into the December Council, secured significant concessions from our EU partners, as per the Deputy's question, covering many issues raised including those pertaining to neutrality, defence and taxation, which were part of the Oireachtas committee's report.  We have delivered on all those recommendations.  We are working on the areas the Deputy mentioned and they will be part of the package.  It is not about implementing something overnight in advance.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	83	That is all we want to hear.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	84	We will respond specifically to the idea of the formal scrutiny reserve mechanism to deal with the issue of secondary legislation and whether we agree with the establishment of an EU panel for the Seanad.  The political parties, independent of the committee's work, have put forward other ideas that have to be taken on board and considered and we are committed to doing that.Should we re-establish the committee?  I will be in discussions with my opposite numbers, Deputy Costello in the Labour Party and others, to see if that is a mechanism for facilitating the final stages of this debate and engagement.  Deputy Timmins is smiling; I do not know why.  Or do we need more formal, direct engagement with the political parties through our spokespersons and the meetings we have already had?
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Can we anticipate domestic legislation dealing with workers' rights and the social charter before its introduction into the general terms of what might be on offer to Ireland?  Will workers' rights and the social charter be in domestic legislation before any referendum and will it be part of any referendum afterwards?  If Ireland provides guarantees in domestic legislation it will then be in a position to look for Europe-wide guarantees to workers.I do not recall the reference to guarantees that we sought in respect of education being central to the sub-committee's report.  I did not think that the sub-committee required any guarantee on conservative education or certain forms of control in the Irish case.  That came in, as it were, from the side.  The same applies to the suggestion about forms of household and the conservative clauses in respect of the family.  Where did they come from before becoming part of a great European guarantee?  I do not recall these issues being raised significantly on doorsteps when I canvassed but I do recall workers' rights being raised.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The charter of fundamental rights represents a significant advance on workers' rights.  Having the Lisbon treaty passed with the charter intact would also be a significant advance for them.  If it does not pass it will be bad for workers.  That principle must be articulated time and again because it is conveniently forgotten whenever we mention workers' rights.  The Deputy is correct in suggesting that there is a domestic agenda, the legislation pertaining to compliance and the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, the agency legislation, how a new legal edifice can be created to recover the position following the Ryanair judgment and several other items on which the social partners, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her Minister for State Deputy Billy Kelleher are working.The European Council issued a statement to the effect that it attached high importance to workers' rights and social services.  The Commission brought in the European employers and trade unions too and is working on the implications of the Laval, Viking and Rüffert judgments for the mobility of workers in the European Union.  It is examining, for example, the directive on postal workers.  It is not clear whether that will be completed in time but it is on the way.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The sub-committee's recommendations did not cover everything.  There is a variety of submissions and we carried out our own research and analysis on the kind of issues that might arise.  The only one pertaining to the Deputy's comment on the family is that it is a general view that Irish people should decide on issues such as abortion.  It is a jurisdictional issue.

Coonan — that the Minister for Health and Children reverse the decision of the HSE on the reorganisation of accident and emergency services in the mid-west as published in the Teamwork report involving the transfer of acute medical and surgical services from Ennis and Nenagh General Hospital to Limerick Regional Hospital; and (16) Deputies Kieran O'Donnell and John Cregan — the establishment of a multi-agency employment and re-training task force.The matters raised by Deputies Eamon Scanlon, Kieran O'Donnell and John Cregan, Pádraic McCormack, and Michael Ring have been selected for discussion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	96	It is 40 days since the House last met.  In that time the Government and the Taoiseach have wandered through an economic desert bereft of ideas, decisions, direction and, dare I say it, the courage to govern.  In that period we were told that it was necessary to cut €2 billion from public spending.  The Government went on holidays, sent papers to, and held meetings with, the social partners and borrowed €55 million a day to keep the nation going.  The Government's indecision has damaged our international standing and made us the butt of international jokes while the cost of money spirals to a dangerous level; people are frightened out of their wits at the loss of, and inability to protect, jobs, and because the Government is offering neither leadership nor direction on its plan, strategy or the decisions it intends to take to move the economy forward with the confidence and trust to which people can respond.The time for talk is over and it is time for decisions.  When does the Taoiseach intend to announce his decisions on public finances, job protection, and restoring the confidence and trust that will give people some semblance of a direction to follow and a structure to discuss?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I reject the Deputy's contentions.  The Government does have direction and has taken decisions as a result of the end of year Exchequer returns which saw a deterioration in the public finances beyond those provided for in the budget.  The Government decided to submit a five year stabilisation plan to the European Commission which requires savings of €2 billion this year, €4 billion for the following two years, €3.5 billion the year after that and €3 billion in year five, until 2013.  It has made a commitment to the Commission to reduce the general Government deficit to less than 3% as required under the Stability and Growth Pact at that time.I undertook before Christmas to use January to work with social partners to ensure that people fully understand the scale of the problem, that this will require a national effort, that people must buy into the requirements of the situation to meet the real political, economic and social challenges facing the country.  That is being finalised this week and weekend.  I said I would do that because I believe it is the way forward.  It involves providing leadership, to ensure that we are all committed to achieving those savings of €2 billion.  The Government has been working to identify these savings.  Unlike the Deputy, we have stated clearly that all areas of expenditure must come into play in achieving those savings of €2 billion and that the ability to identify in terms of pay or pay-related, pension and non-pay issues is the best means by which we can minimise the impact on those who require services which is funded by the non-pay side of the budget.  Those are the types of approach we have made and discussions we have held.  The discussions continue and progress is being made.  We will know by the end of the week whether we can come to an agreement on a framework for a pact that will bring stabilisation, that will be based on social solidarity, and that will allow us to take the opportunity for reform that this recession provides for us.As Taoiseach, I am acutely aware that people are losing their jobs and that more will lose jobs.  I am acutely aware of the fact that this open economy is not immune from the international developments which have taken place.  I am acutely aware of the Government's responsibility to bring forward a macro-economic plan on our public finances that meets with our obligations as members of the eurozone, and to bring forward at the same time micro-initiatives on all the issues the Deputy mentioned to deal with the savings of €2 billion that must be identified.  We are prepared to do this.  We are actively engaged in it and we are finalising it at the moment.The proposals put forward by the Deputy and his party during the Dáil recess would be totally inadequate and would go in the opposite direction.  The proposals put forward, such as a freeze in the increments for public pay and a contribution made by those earning over €100,000, would bring forward a maximum of about €330 million if it was provided for in full.  He also spoke about the need to increase capital spending by €1 billion, all of which would make us worse off by €700 million.We are going in the other direction.  We are looking at all areas of current and capital expenditure.  We have identified the €20 billion that is needed for pay and pension costs, the €20 billion in social welfare and social security costs, and the €15 billion in non-pay costs on the current side.  We are identifying all areas of expenditure and engaging with the social partners in order to solve this problem and provide the €2 billion in savings in a way that will minimise its impact on ordinary working people and those people who require the delivery of State services.

He is the person who brought in the budget last October that attacked the vulnerable, the voiceless and the defenceless.  He is the person who put thousands of the elderly on the streets when he tried to take away their medical cards.  He is the person who attempted to take away the allowance for intellectually challenged young people at home.  He is the person whose Minister for Social and Family Affairs stated recently that the carer's allowance should be halved.

When I proposed six years ago that if the Government was going to pay for benchmarking, the very least it should do is look at the possibilities of public service reform and the cost of that.  Benchmarking is now costing €2 billion per annum.  I was here in the 1980s when tax rates were 60%, interest rates were 20% and inflation was 16%, and all Fianna Fáil did from these benches was scoff and not give any credit or assistance in the national interest to the Government of the day.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	102	We were the first party to put forward the view that it was necessary to freeze the national pay deal.  We put forward the view that there should be a recapitalisation programme for the banks.  If the Taoiseach is interested in constructive suggestions, then I will give him some.  His members have been talking out of the side of their mouths about national consensus and a national Government.  We have an interest in the way this country moves.  We have an interest in protecting the country and in seeing that confidence is restored to our economy.  I have some suggestions that do not represent all the answers to the Government's problems, but if the Taoiseach is looking for consensus, will he support a reversal of the outrageous VAT increase that has cost jobs all over the country and led to an outflow to Northern Ireland?  Is he prepared to abolish PRSI for employers who take on new employees in 2009?  Is he prepared to give a tax exemption for companies that involve themselves in research and new product development?  Is he prepared to freeze Government charges and rates, so that some confidence will be restored to small businesses and small enterprises?I do not make these suggestions purely from a partisan party point of view, but as constructive suggestions in the interest of retaining and creating jobs.  If the Taoiseach wants consensus and support, I have just given him four suggestions today.  I will return to the banks at another time.  These suggestions would help the Government to put some semblance of economic sanity to the floundering it has been at for the last six weeks.

However, I will not take the criticism that the Government is floundering around what it wants to do.  The Government is determined——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The Deputy can make his remarks and snigger later.  The Government is determined to pull everyone behind this national effort.  It will not be done without engaging with those who have a stake in this society.  I remind people that when we faced a difficult situation in 1987, we pulled together even though not everyone agreed that was the approach.  I believe in this approach.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Can the Taoiseach tell us what the approach is?

When he becomes leader, he can ask the questions.  I believe in this approach as a problem solving approach.  The first and immediate objective, as set out by the Government, in terms of its obligations internally and in terms of maximising internal confidence, bringing internal confidence to our own country and ensuring that there is external confidence in how we run our affairs——

We will do that.  We will do it on the basis of the social partnership approach in which we are engaged.  We will use the course of this month to achieve that common approach.  I believe that progress is being made.  I cannot say tonight that we have agreement on those issues, but I believe that the process of engagement is the best method by which we can bring the country behind us to face up to the real situation out there at the moment.In making that case, it is often portrayed as an attempt by the Government to abdicate its responsibility.  That is far from the case.  It is the Government's responsibility, in the interests of a successful implementation of such a consolidation programme, to have people behind us and to speak to those people who represent legitimate stakeholders in society, such as employers, employees, trade unions, farmers and the voluntary pillar——-

I will list some of the big job losses that have been announced since 1 January last — 1,900 at Dell; 290 at Dublin Bus; 300 at Kostal; 120 at Amann; 400 at Superquinn; 320 at Bus Éireann; 180 at Cigna; 145 at Britvic; 220 at Galmoy Mines; 750 at Ulster Bank and First Active; and 1,000 in local authorities.  Many more people have lost their jobs in shops, restaurants, architects' practices, solicitors' practices and building sites.Some 154,000 people were on the live register 18 months ago, on the day of the 2007 general election.  That number has doubled since then and is predicted by some commentators to increase to 420,000 by the end of this year.  Can the Taoiseach give the House details of the total cost to the Exchequer, taking social welfare payments, secondary benefits and lost tax revenue into account, of the addition to the live register of 120,000 people over the past year?  Similarly, can he give the House an estimate of the additional cost to the Exchequer of an increase in unemployment to 420,000 by the end of this year?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I assure the Deputy, in response to his introductory remarks, that I am not suggesting I run this House other than by the authority of the Dáil.  When I was arguing my case in response to Deputy Kenny, I made the point that I have a responsibility to do this job as I believe it should be done, for as long as I hold it.  That is a prerequisite for, and the prerogative of, anybody who holds this position.  It was in that sense, and in no other sense, that I said what I had to say.  I am as committed a democrat as anyone else.  I am a part of the democratic life of this country, just like anyone else.  I have had the privilege and honour of representing my constituency for many years as a result.  We do not part the waves on that particular point.I will have to get more details before I can respond fully to Deputy Gilmore.  However, I can tell him that it is estimated that for every 100,000 people who are unemployed, revenues of approximately €1 billion need to be devoted to the social welfare Vote alone.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The task we face is made more difficult by the fact that social costs are increasing and revenues are decreasing.  It is clear that if we are to bridge the gap, or reduce the deficit that has grown, expenditure savings and taxation changes will be required in the years ahead.  We will need to strike a balance to protect as many jobs as possible, while putting in place the basis on which services can be provided in the future.  A combination of measures will be required over the medium and long terms.  The report of the Commission on Taxation, which will be published later this year, represents a timely opportunity to undertake a systemic review of all aspects of our taxation system in the context of the new challenges we face, such as the fact that we will not be returning to the large rates of economic growth we saw in the past.Like the rest of the western and developed world, Ireland needs to adapt to the profound changes that are occurring in the context of the current financial and economic crisis and the global recession in which we are all enveloped.  Choices will have to be made by the Government as we proceed.  If we are to meet the clear challenge of upholding the principle of social solidarity, as I believe we should seek to do, the burden of adjustment will have to be equitably borne by everybody.  That means those who have a greater capacity to carry that burden will have to do so.  A political judgment will have to be made, one that is not perfect and will never meet with unanimity.  Given the fluid situation we are in, the scale of the challenge is such that we cannot suggest with any certainty that any constituency or cohort of people can be immune from the impact of the adjustment that has to be made.  However, we will work on the basis of trying to stabilise the public finances and provide social solidarity.  We will use this opportunity to try to reform a range of areas.  It is clear that the status quo does not represent a model for maintaining the level of services our people are entitled to expect, even in these difficult times.We will bring certain proposals to the people in the aftermath of the current discussions, which I hope will prove successful.  It is properly the right of this House to debate these issues on an ongoing basis.  It is important — week in, week out; month, in month out; and year in, year out — to engage in an ongoing effort to ensure that the steps back we have to take now do not involve more than a temporary adjustment.  When the economic recession ends and there is an upturn in the global economy, we will need to be able to play to our strengths.  We will have to work on short-term initiatives while dealing with the long-term structural problems we face.  Our tax base decreased by 15% in the last financial year and it may decrease further this year.We need to be proactive in helping the newly unemployed to focus on getting back into employment as soon as possible.  It is planned to increase the number of places provided each year under the jobsearch and employment support services from 78,000 to 147,000.  It is also planned to increase the number of places in FÁS short training courses for the newly unemployed from 27,000 to 78,000.  A further 400 subsidised jobs will be offered to redundant apprentices.  FÁS has established a training fund to respond speedily to the retraining needs of low-skilled workers and redundant craft workers.Enterprise Ireland needs to continue to assist start-up companies and identify growth areas in markets where problems are being encountered at present.  Not only do we have to contend with the global downturn and the financial crisis that is enveloping the developed world, but we also have to deal with problems on the currency side, such as the depreciation of over 30% in the value of sterling compared to the euro over recent months, which is placing a great burden on our exporting community, including many companies in the indigenous sector.

We have been told that the Taoiseach and the Government have been preoccupied over recent weeks with the state of the public finances.  We have heard about all kinds of meetings, such as day-long and two-day Cabinet meetings, at which the state of the public finances has been considered.  I asked the Taoiseach two simple questions, but he was unable to reply to either of them.  The Government is examining the public finances at a time when the biggest economic problem we face is the loss of jobs.  In such economic circumstances, I am utterly astonished that the Taoiseach — the Head of Government — did not give the House a ballpark figure for the total cost to the Exchequer of rising unemployment.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	143	We will follow it.  I heard the Taoiseach say that for every 100,000 people who are unemployed, social welfare payments of approximately €1 billion need to be made.  That figure increases to €1.2 billion when one considers that 120,000 people have lost their jobs under this Administration so far.  When one factors in secondary benefits and the loss of tax revenue, it seems we are talking about a ballpark figure of between €2 billion and €2.5 billion.  That figure will double if an additional 120,000 people lose their jobs over the course of the next year.  That big gap is causing the problem in the public finances.  That is where moneys are being lost.  When people lose their jobs, problems arise in the public finances.  The Taoiseach has not been able to tell the House with any accuracy what the extent of that problem is, or what are the future projections in respect of it.  He has not said anything about putting people back to work.  The Taoiseach has spoken in general terms, in response to Deputy Kenny, about a macro-economic plan, micro initiatives and a national effort.  However, we have seen none of this.  A debate on the economy will begin in the House tomorrow morning but the Government has produced no plan, no strategy and no proposals.  The Taoiseach told us his big idea was to have discussions with the social partners.  I am all in favour of this and have been suggesting since last October that such discussions take place.  The Taoiseach convened a meeting of the social partners last Friday.  No Minister attended that meeting and the Taoiseach had no proposals for the social partners.  Apparently, the Taoiseach has today given them some type of framework document which contains no specifics.The public understands that we are in an economic crisis, that many people are losing their jobs and that measures must be taken to address the problem.  The difficulty we have is that the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, even after a six-week break to enable him to do it——

We have set out those action points and they will be acted upon in the coming weeks and months as we implement our policies.However, in order to be successful in implementing any plan, we must bring some stability to the public finance position.  We have set out a plan that will bring about an adjustment of some €16.5 billion between taxation measures and expenditure cuts in the next five years.

We are beginning step one in regard to 2009 by finalising our arrangements during the coming week and bringing to the House those savings of €2 billion.  That is what we intend to do.  Thereafter, we will work with the social partners on an ongoing basis on the basis of an agreed framework for action as to how we deal with the problems that will arise as the recession perhaps continues, prolongs and deepens.  That is what we have to do and what we are doing.  To suggest we are not doing that is not to acknowledge the facts as they are.

We said then that if we are to achieve those objectives we must restore order to our public finances.  We begin on that road this week.  We are involving the social partners during the course of this month in order to achieve broad agreement on the approach we intend to take.  We are looking at all areas of expenditure in a way in which the Opposition was not prepared to do——

I again call on the Government to show urgency by immediately establishing this employment and retraining taskforce, properly resourced and with broad terms of reference and incorporating funding for the Limerick regeneration project which can provide much needed employment.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment today.

Yet the Minister and the Health Service Executive carry on with the removal of staff and services regardless of possible consequences to the people of Monaghan.  This process is now being extended to other areas of the country, as highlighted by my colleagues, which demands a full debate in the House.  This policy must be changed.

The Taoiseach circulated a framework document to the social partners today to engage with them on matters pertaining to the agreement signed up to last year.  Members of this House are not being made privy to the content and detail of that framework document.In light of the debate currently signalled for the next two days and given that the substantial amount of work this House will address over the three sitting days of this week are statements on the economy, Members, in the absence of that information, are being asked to participate without the full raft of information necessary to inform their participation.  Will the Taoiseach indicate that he will circulate the detail of the framework document that has been presented to the social partners to all Members to facilitate an informed debate and participation, given that he and other spokespersons, including the Minister for Finance, have repeatedly challenged the Opposition voices to come up with other solutions?  All Opposition voices have a role in this regard in terms of providing information and making useful proposals, but that can only be done in the context of a sharing of the full information available.If the Taoiseach is prepared to share with the social partners outside this House the content of the framework document, surely he has a responsibility to share the same information with the elected representatives in this House.  I am not prepared to agree to the Order of Business in the absence of the Taoiseach indicating that this information will be shared to enable us to properly prepare for the statements on the economy over the next two days.

Discussions are ongoing.  I make the point that we set out a framework based on the principles by which we will seek to deal with the situation this country is facing.  We will work together in the weeks and months ahead to make sure that we implement policies that meet the requirements of the situation we face.  That is the way we did it before when we introduced the Programme for National Recovery and that is what we should do now.  The details we can work out are those that can emerge in due course.The important political statement to be made in this country at this time is that all stakeholders in this society will work together to try to bring about a resolution to our problems, based on principles we can all share and to which we can all subscribe, and act in a political way to try to drive confidence inside and outside the country.  That is what we are trying to do.  That is the first prerequisite.

First, we are on the eve of a major debate on the economy and the Government has not yet informed the House as to what exactly it proposes.  It will be somewhat absurd to have a major economic debate tomorrow without having heard what are the Government's proposals.  Presumably by the time the Government announces its proposals we will have had the debate.  It really is an absurd way of doing business.I wish to hear from the Taoiseach whether he has any proposals to change the arrangements for the economic debate, either in such a way that we have the proposals and the Government's decisions before tomorrow, or that the time of the debate be changed in order for it to take place after the Government's proposals are announced.The second reason for opposing this item is that the Bill is further evidence of the Government's incompetence.

We already had the experience last year whereby the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, appointed members of local authorities to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, for which he had no authority.  We now have legislation which proposes that appointments made within the framework of the Residential Tenancies Act were not valid.  That must be corrected.  We were told in the documentation circulated yesterday that this problem came to the Minister's attention in December.  If it came to the Minister's attention then, why were the Opposition spokespersons not told about it until 24 hours ago?  We are now dealing with the matter by emergency legislation.I know the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has been preoccupied with changing lightbulbs in recent times.

It came to the attention of the Department that the three-year rule set out in section 159(2) was not complied with in respect of ten members of the board, which was as a result of the board making those appointments as per the Act.  As a result, it is important not to have open to legal challenge the work of those tribunals.I do not think anyone questions the competence and professionalism of those tribunals — that is not in question.  However, having to revisit those cases on foot of a technical procedural error would not serve tenants, landlords or the taxpayer well.  The solution, therefore, is for emergency legislation to validate the appointments to the dispute resolution committee and the associated work undertaken by the committee and its members.  This was approved this morning by Government and is being discussed in the Dáil today.  In order to ensure that it not be open to legal challenge, we bring it this afternoon to go through all the procedures.

Yesterday, I listened to an advocate of the Fianna Fáil Party on television saying that this is an opportunity to set out every one's stall, that people will judge and that this is an opportunity for the Government to lead by setting out its stall.  Is the Taoiseach prepared, at the very least, to furnish the Opposition spokespersons on finance with the framework document, so that at least there is some semblance of a structure to a debate which will take place before the Government announces any decisions in respect of the negotiations with the social partners?If the House is to be accountable in any way or is to have any sense of importance, the framework sent to the social partners should be given to the Opposition spokespersons on finance.  After all, the House represents all sectors of society.  Everyone here is elected and sent here by the electorate from whatever region and for whatever reason.With regard to the published list of impending legislation, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, Deputy Seán Barrett, and the committee produced the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Draft Bill 2009 which could replace the foreshore legislation.  This is an issue of serious concern as we are constrained, restricted and held up on a range of fronts.  The Bill, published and agreed by the committee on a cross-party basis, does not appear on the list.  When is it intended to introduce the Bill in the House?  It is important legislation.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced that he would introduce it to the House when it was published.  I see no evidence of this on the list.Last week, we dealt with the legislation on the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  Prior to the introduction of that Bill, the Minister for Finance in his own generous way said he would be prepared to come before the House and answer questions about the banking situation for as long as necessary.  This has not yet been sorted out.  We will give the Minister time to do so if he wishes.  Is it intended that the Minister will allow for a real question and answer session?  Members have a range of issues concerning the banking crisis and constraints on the flow of credit to business on which we would like to hear the Minister pronounce.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I refer to the first matter raised by the Deputy.  The issue of an opportunity to discuss the economic situation of the country was unanimously sought by everyone when we returned to the House and was, therefore, accommodated.  I do not determine the length of negotiations or discussions taking place with the social partners, in terms of how the Government is trying to address this issue as outlined during Leaders' Questions.  It does not take away from the debate on the economy tomorrow and the following day, because it is important that everyone in the House has the opportunity to speak, if they so wish, on the first week in which we return.  Had we not said we were bringing forward an opportunity for a debate on the economy, the argument would have been different.  It would have been suggested that the Government was not prepared to ensure that a relevant matter of urgent concern to all citizens was not discussed this week.  We have accommodated the need and there are many issues that can be raised and articulated by Deputies from all sides of the House in respect of the two-day session on the economy that will take place tomorrow and the following day.  That is as it should be.

Today, the Taoiseach has told Members that they can have the opportunity to debate the framework document after it has been agreed or in other words, when it is a fait accompli.  This is absolutely disgraceful.  The Taoiseach has asked the elected Members of the Parliament of the people to blindfoldedly sign off on proposals and measures the Government is bringing forward.  Earlier, Members of this House had an opportunity to support a vote calling for the framework document to be shared and unfortunately it did not receive the support it deserved.  I welcome those voices that now call for it because this House and its Members are being treated disgracefully by the Government, the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance.  Members are being asked to come into the House over the next couple of days to address statements on the economy with one hand tied behind their backs.

Is the Taoiseach aware that since the general election in 2007, the Government thus far has published 44 Bills, of which 38 have been enacted?  Is he aware that at the equivalent point in the life of the 29th Dáil, the Government had published 65 Bills, of which 58 had been enacted?  The obvious message relayed by those statistics is that the Government and all Departments are operating at less than 66% of the performance that applied in the previous Dáil.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I wish to raise three different issues.  I have been raising the issue of the attachment of fines for years.  While it has been promised in numerous debates, I note it now has been removed completely from the list of proposed Bills.  Can the Taoiseach provide an indication when a similar measure will be introduced to allow money to be collected in a more constructive way?  Second, while the Minister for Health and Children is no longer with us, the health information Bill would be a highly important tool to get the truth from the health system.  It now is in 65th place on the list and is moving backwards, rather than forward.  Finally, I back my colleague, Deputy Creed.  When the farm waste management scheme was announced, I asked questions regarding its financing and was assured in a glib fashion that there would be no problem.  However, we now have a problem.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I assure Deputy Crawford that the Minister for Health and Children is very much with us.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	312	There is no Bill relating to the third matter.  As for the fines Bill, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is preparing a fines Bill, for which I understand the Minister shortly will seek Government approval to publish.  It will include provisions, with some redrafting, that were addressed in the Fines Bill 2007.  Such provisions will be aimed at giving the courts new powers to deal with a person's failure to pay a fine by the due date for payment.  As the proposed new Bill will incorporate redrafted provisions contained in the Fines Bill 2007, it appears sensible to withdraw the latter from the Order Paper on publication of the Bill being drafted at present.  This is the reason the Fines Bill on the Order Paper has not been proceeded with.  The new Bill should be ready for publication during the coming Dáil session.On the health information Bill, a wide-ranging public consultation exercise, using a detailed discussion document prepared in the Department, was initiated last June.  Many submissions were received, including several received in late October 2008.  All those who made submissions were invited to participate in a major feature on the Bill at the annual conference of the Healthcare Informatics Society of Ireland on 19 November last.  The event proved highly successful and the level of consultation is considered to be essential given the complex and sensitive nature of the Bill.  The Department is working towards finalising the heads of the Bill, which are expected in April.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Today and in recent days, the Taoiseach has advocated consensus and co-operation.  The Government will introduce emergency legislation today because of a legal gap that has come to light at relatively short notice.  I have pointed out previously and now wish to point out on the Order of Business in respect of legislation; that a primary school exists in north Dublin that is illegal.  It is operated by the VEC, for which there is no statutory basis.  I have drafted legislation that literally is a two line amendment to the Vocational Education Act 1930 and its related legislation.There is no point in lecturing this House about co-operation and consensus unless the Government takes sensible ideas that its overworked parliamentary draftsmen cannot produce, for whatever reason.  With the consent of all Members, this legislation could be brought in on a Thursday to put on a statutory basis something that will otherwise end up in the courts and will cause taxpayers unnecessary costs because Members did not get their act together.  I invite the Taoiseach to consider this legislation.  I have written to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, suggesting that he should take it up as the Labour Party cannot take this in Parliament.  It is not worth three hours of Private Members' time because there is no issue in respect of it.  It could be moved, subject to the agreement of the Whips, on a day of soft legislation of which there have been many in recent months.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Deputy Quinn stated he has written to the Minister concerned on the position.  I do not have the detail in front of me.  I will take the matter up with the Minister.I understand there is a Bill in preparation, due to be provided shortly.  Deputy Quinn has devised his own Bill.  I do not know whether it is in line with what the Minister proposes.  I will have to check.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	315	On the EU directive on combating money laundering, Ireland was meant to have signed up to that directive in November of 2007.  We have been promised for some years a criminal justice (money laundering) Bill.  As the Taoiseach is aware, and as he has referred to on several occasions, there are several thousand people in Ireland working in fund management and, because the anti-money laundering legislation to comply with the directive has not been brought in, they are being put at a competitive disadvantage to those working in fund management in the UK, in the Channel Islands, in Luxembourg and in other jurisdictions.Given the difficulties in the banking sector, I fail to understand.  We are being reported and brought before the European Court of Justice for our failure to implement the directive in Irish law.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	317	It is on the pink sheet but I have no confidence that we will see it.  Why can that not be brought in?  Fragile jobs in fund management are now very competitive world-wide.  This is a small competitive disadvantage that the Government is imposing on jobs in the finance sector by simply failing to legislate for this.Why not bring it in next week?  It is not difficult legislation.

It is fully intended that the Bill will be published before the end of the spring session.

Does placing the report on that list in effect mean that the Attorney General's difficulties with the report, if any, have now been resolved and, therefore, the Government is accepting the key recommendation and all the recommendations of the Coffey report, in other words, to set aside the key finding of the Keane tribunal report that arson was the probable cause of that fire rather than, as Mr. Paul Coffey SC rightly notes, that the cause could not determined?

We were led to believe that the legislation was at a very advanced stage of preparation and that a number of Departments were preparing the legislation.I have looked at the pink list and it does not seem to be there, unless it is hidden in among the Bills proposed.  I have looked at the white list and I still cannot find it.I wonder is it intended to bring in that legislation.

Work is progressing toward bringing the heads of the Bill to Government at the earliest available opportunity.  Officials from the Office of the Minister for Children are working with their counterparts in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward legislation.  It is extremely complex and potentially has constitutional implications, but we are anxious to bring it forward during the course of this year, given the background to this situation.

I shall then outline the background to and the need for this legislation before making use of this opportunity to consider some of the key challenges facing the PRTB in the months ahead.  In all this, I recognise the collective commitment of this House to a well-functioning private rental sector in general and to an efficient and cost-effective means of resolving disputes between tenants and landlords.  I trust that colleagues on the benches opposite will understand the need for this legislation and will engage with it positively in the best interests of tenants, landlords and the taxpayer.A commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector was established by my Department in July 1999.  The terms of reference of the commission were:To examine the working of the landlord and tenant relationship in respect of residential tenancies in the private rented sector and to make such recommendations, including changes to the law, as the Commission considers proper, equitable and feasible with a view to:Improving the security of tenure of tenants in the occupation of their dwellings;Maintaining a fair and reasonable balance between the respective rights and obligations of landlords and existing and future tenants;Increasing investment in, and the supply of, residential accommodation for renting, including the removal of any identified constraints to the development of the sector; and to report to the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal by 1 June, 2000.The commission consisted of representatives of the legal, accounting and auctioneering professions, property investment specialists and representatives of both landlord and tenant interests, as well as representatives from my Department and the Departments of Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social and Family Affairs.  The commission conducted extensive research into the situation on the ground for landlords and tenants, the existing regulatory framework, including regulation of standards of rented housing, and the financial and taxation implications for landlords, tenants and investors.The report of the commission was published in July 2000, and this report formed the basis of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The Act provides, inter alia, for a measure of security for tenants of certain dwellings, amendment of the law of landlord and tenant on basic rights and the obligations of each of the parties, for allowing of disputes between such parties to be resolved cheaply and speedily, and, most importantly, for the establishment of the PRTB.The PRTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The principal activities of the PRTB include the registration of private rental tenancies, the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords and the provision of information, assistance and advice to the Minister on the private rental sector.I would like to turn to the specific reasons for this legislation.  Section 159 of the Residential Tenancies Act empowers the board of the PRTB to establish a dispute resolution committee, DRC, to delegate functions to it and to appoint its members.  The members, when required, form the tenancy tribunals that determine tenancy disputes.  Section 159 provides that the membership of the committee must contain at least four members of the PRTB's board, but also specifies that, to be eligible for appointment to the committee, any board member must, at the time of appointment to the committee, have at least three years remaining in his or her term of office as a board member.  Subsection 159(4) requires the board to consult the Minister before appointing members, including the chairperson, to the DRC.It was brought to my Department's attention by the PRTB in mid-December 2008 that nine of its board members who had been appointed a year earlier to the committee and one further member appointed in January 2007 did not satisfy the three-year rule.  On further examination, doubts were also raised concerning the extent to which the consultative requirements of section 159 were formally complied with.  The effect of this was to raise questions around the constitution of the committee and, hence, the dispute resolution work carried out under its aegis.  To ensure that the matters involved are regularised urgently, today's legislation has been introduced to validate the appointments to the committee and the associated work undertaken by it and its members.It is important to stress that the competence and professionalism of the tribunals is not in question.  The procedures adopted were robust and proper and the outcomes and judgments were arrived at properly.  None the less, the technical mistake places a question mark over the more than 100 tribunals convened that have contained at least one incorrectly appointed board member.To remove any uncertainty in this regard and in respect of compliance with the consultation requirements of section 159 more generally and, thereby, to ensure that tribunal-related work by the PRTB is validated, I have introduced this legislation.  Given the good progress made by the PRTB in recent months in addressing the challenges facing it, it is essential that this potential uncertainty be removed.  To do otherwise would not serve tenants, landlords or the taxpayer well.The Bill validates the appointments to the DRC and the associated work undertaken by the committee and its members.  It validates the irregular appointments and deems as valid any acts by the DRC prior to the emergency legislation.  It corrects a technical legal error and allows the PRTB to proceed confidently with its essential work.I would like to emphasise to the House that when attention was brought to this issue last month, my Department requested the PRTB to commission urgently an external audit to check compliance with the provisions of the 2004 Act in terms of governance and legal structures, the appointment of board and committee members and any other relevant aspects.  This audit was to be undertaken by an appropriate external party, with access to legal advice as necessary.  The compliance audit has since been completed and has identified no similar issues requiring legislative correction.Regarding the details of the PRTB's mission, I am pleased to report on the significant achievements it has attained in providing a stable framework for the better operation of the landlord-tenant relationship.  Since its establishment in September 2004, a notable success of the PRTB has been the registration to date of more than 304,735 tenancies compared to fewer than 23,000 registered with local authorities in 2004.  Almost 210,000 current tenancies are registered with the PRTB.  During 2007, the PRTB received almost 1,500 dispute applications for determination and slightly in excess of that in 2008.  These disputes are in areas such as deposit retention, illegal eviction, rent arrears, anti-social behaviour and various other breaches of landlord or tenant obligations.Partly as a consequence of the board's success in ensuring registration compliance and the resulting large workloads arising, it is acknowledged that the processing times for dispute resolutions are not yet optimal.  This situation has arisen due to a combination of the significant increase in demand in line with expansion of the sector and the quasi-judicial process involved, which requires time-consuming work, for instance, the heavy administrative requirements of proceeding with court actions.  However, it is important to note that, while the PRTB provides dispute resolution services, fewer than 1% of all registered tenancies seek to avail of its dispute resolution mechanisms.  This indicates that a healthy and stable landlord-tenant relationship prevails in the vast majority of tenancies.In response to the large and ongoing volume of work with which it needed to deal, the board of the PRTB requested an additional 14 permanent staff to bring its permanent staffing complement from 26 to 40.  This was approved by my Department in early 2008 and the additional personnel were recruited during the summer of 2008.

For example, 516 determination orders issued in 2008 compared to 400 in 2007.  Processing time for tenancy registration has been reduced significantly in the past year and there has been an expansion in the range of activities.Due to the nature and complexity of the Act, one element of the board's remit is to assess the functioning of the PRTB and of the Act itself and to make suggestions for improvements to the original legislation.  This review is ongoing and a number of notable legislative changes to the Act have been proposed to my Department by the board.  I hope to take a significant number of those suggestions on board as part of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  Some relevant amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act were debated on Committee Stage in the Seanad late last year.  I hope to table a number of other related amendments on Committee Stage in this House.  I commend the Bill to the House.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I am anxious to facilitate the Minister of State in respect of this legislation, as I understand the legal difficulties that could arise for his Department were the House not to approve it.  However, I am critical of the mess that the PRTB and the Department have made in terms of overseeing the appointment of the people in question.In June 2008, the Opposition brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, the fact that two of his appointees were members of a local authority, but he dismissed the matter.  He then discovered that they were not entitled to be members of the board in light of the fact that they were political representatives.  The legislation was unambiguous in prohibiting members of local authorities or other public representatives from being appointed.One would have expected the Department to put in place the necessary oversight of this and other agencies to prevent a similar mistake from recurring, but it has recurred.  It is embarrassing for the Minister of State to correct the error on behalf of the Government.  I do not level the blame at him, but at his Department and the senior Minister.  That there was a problem with the manner in which corporate governance issues and appointments were being made was up there in lights.  A mistake was made as recently as last September.In the briefing given by the Minister of State, he mentioned how much head way has been made by the board in respect of these matters, but I am afraid that I must differ with him on the basis of experience.  The board was set up as an agency to improve the system through which disputes between landlords and tenants are resolved.  However, there are still cases where, after lasting for an average of 11 or 13 months, landlords must go to court to repossess their houses.  At the time, the Department was warned about the possibility of these cases being dragged out to the extent that the landlord suffered by being unable to collect rent.  Irresponsible tenants, of whom there are unfortunately too many, are playing every trick in the book in order to prolong the length of time they can remain in accommodation free of charge.  This arises because the Private Residential Tenancies Board is not making decisions quickly enough.I ask the Minister of State, in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, to which he has indicated he will introduce amendments, to take on board the genuine cases and the suffering endured by people in having their rights vindicated under this legislation.I received a letter today from a person in County Wicklow who is out of pocket to the tune of €31,000 in unpaid rent, of which more than €20,000 has accrued owing to delays on the part of this board, which is unacceptable.  I will provide the Minister of State with the relevant information in this regard which may assist him in reaching conclusions about the operation, or not, of this board.While I will support the passing of this legislation given the legal issues to which the State could be exposed, I am critical of the board's operation.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	358	When speaking in the Seanad on the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003, I pointed out that the Bill contained 11 additional pages that had not been debated in the Dáil and that it was imperative we prevented it being rushed through or being merely rubber-stamped by the House.  The guillotine of the Dáil Report Stage led to 37 Government amendments being passed without debate, many of which were substantial and involved considerable additions to the Bill as originally introduced.I had hoped that the Bill, when completed, would be well structured, watertight legislation, encompassing rights and responsibilities for tenants and landlords, that would revitalise the private rental sector.  However, it seems the maxim that rushed legislation is bad legislation holds true in respect of this and many other Bills rushed through both Houses by this Government.So flawed is the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 that neither the Minister of State nor his Department was able to interpret its provisions, or so he would have us believe.  Five years later, the product of that rushed legislation has brought us back to debate loopholes that could potentially lead to more than 100 decisions being open to legal challenge or having to be set aside by the board.  It would be a shameful misuse of resources if the PRTB were required to visit the tribunal cases in questions.  Equally, it would be shameful if any hint of a cover-up were to attach to this legislation.It now appears that rushing through of what became the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 left grey areas which have led to problems of invalid appointments to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  This could lead to massive legal challenges that would impact adversely on the work of the board.  As I said earlier, the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 was rushed legislation which stands as a testament to Government mismanagement.  We are now forced to debate all Stages of this Bill today.This is worrying; it is history repeating itself with the Government rushing all Stages of the Bill through this House by way of last minute changes to the Dáil schedule.  This is outrageous given there were six weeks recess time during which the schedule could have been finalised, thus providing Members with adequate prior notice of this legislation.  To add insult to injury, copies of the Bill were only made available to us this afternoon.  The feeling of whitewash and cover-up persists.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I wish to pose a few questions to the Minister of State which I hope he will consider.  Given the time restriction, I will pose these questions in the context of a Second Stage contribution.For the Minister of State to say this is simply a technical amendment is, perhaps, an understatement deserving of some type of gold medal.  To suggest this is a simple matter is most unfair.  The board has serious questions to answer as, indeed, does the Minister of State and his superior.The dispute resolution committee has been deemed invalid.  It follows, therefore, that any decisions made by it were also invalid.  The Minister of State said that approximately 100 decisions were made.  Perhaps he will confirm if that is the case and, the nature of these decisions.  How many of them have been challenged, how many court cases are pending and where stand the applications for judicial review, of which I understand there are a number?  The Minister of State might also address the matter of costs borne by people who have taken legal action on the basis that a decision was invalid under the law.  I would like also if the Minister of State would address the issue of the advice of the Attorney General, a matter not mentioned in his speech.  I believe the Minister of State's speech to be a little less than what the occasion might warrant because he pads it for the first and last few pages and uses less than one page to set out the need for this legislation.The need for this legislation arose as a result of a cock-up of a fairly basic nature in the Department on the part of the superior Minister who is not present in the House this evening.  I want to know where stands the invalid decisions that are before the courts.  Are they affected by this legislation?  My answer is "No".  I want the Minister of State to confirm that the invalid decisions will stand.  If he takes issue with that, I want him to give me chapter and verse in this regard and outline what advice he adduces in that regard.  I want to know why the claimants to the court have not been contacted and why and how this legislation is seen as no less than a bolt from the blue.  No notice of its introduction was given.  The Minister of State stated he first heard about it last month, which I find difficult to believe given the dogs in the street were barking about it for months prior to that.This matter is wholly and entirely unsatisfactory.  I regret that I must bring my remarks to a conclusion at this point.  This is sham democracy at its worst.  The Minister of State has approximately 40 minutes to respond to the questions I have asked and I hope he will do so.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I hoped, when putting my notes together this evening, that the Minister would be in the Chamber for this debate.  It is unfortunate he is not here given the debacle of his two earlier appointments to the PRTB and the similarity of the situation in which we now find ourselves.The Minister of State is proposing this evening to introduce retrospective legislation.  We are going down the dangerous route of believing something can be rectified by latterly introducing legislation to correct past mistakes.  It beggars belief that the Minister, Ministers of State and their advisers and handlers never read the Act.  That is what happened.  It is what happened in respect of the appointment of the two councillors concerned.  The difficulty in which we find ourselves arises out of their not having read the Act.  The Act was fundamentally flawed in terms of the dispute resolution committee's term of office being three years while that of the PRTB was five years.  The sequencing in this regard was always going to create difficulties.  Hence, the difficulty we are now in.A valuable opportunity is being missed this evening to rectify a whole series of anomalies that exist under the PRTB and the Residential Tenancies Act.  The first issue relates to the licensing of landlords.  A coach and four is being driven through the legislation by property owners who rent out their properties and exempt themselves from registering their properties with the PRTB.  The opportunity to address this matter is being missed.  More fundamentally, the PRTB is not required under the Freedom of Information Act to disclose information.  Given that the Exchequer and ultimately the State is paying for the operation of this board, it is a nonsense that FOI does not apply.  Also, it is nonsense that parliamentary questions to the Minister in regard to the operations of the PRTB are not deemed to be in order in this House.  That is another issue which could be corrected here, this evening.  When one writes to the Minister about the PRTB, he says it is a matter for it, yet when one writes to the PRTB, it informs Deputies to the effect that it can only conduct itself within the scope of specific legislation.  That is complete nonsense.The other opportunity that might have been dealt with this evening is the introduction of a deposit retention scheme.  I hope to debate this later, on Committee Stage.  This is a proposal that would save the State millions of euro every year.  The PRTB could operate a deposit retention system, rather than the present situation, whereby landlords hold deposits.  This takes up much of Threshold's time, as the advocating agency on behalf of tenants and gives rise to much of the conflict that the PRTB deals with.  There would be two benefits from this.  A neutral agency would hold the deposit, which could travel from one tenancy to another.  More importantly, given the rental accommodation scheme being operated by the HSE, millions of euro are being held in deposits, which the State could either notionally have held with the PRTB or lodged into an account from which it could derive interest.  That is another question I shall put to the Minister of State this evening, as something that would provide an income for the State while improving landlord-tenancy law in Ireland inordinately.The Minister of State talks, in his response, about an audit being carried out last month.  On 9 October, when this situation broke, with the appointment of two illegal appointees to the PRTB, I called for an audit from the Minister.  I said at the time, "This cock-up opens up the possibility that the propriety of other appointments made by the Minister since taking office may also be questioned".  I called for a full audit of all such appointments and a report to be placed before the Dáil.If that audit had been carried out at the time, we would not now be in the difficult situation we are in.  I also asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, four times during the course of the debate to explain how this information came before him, as regards those councillors.  Again, I should like to ask the Minister of State this evening how this specific information came before him, because a number of matters are contained in the Bill, and it is important that the House knows how the information reached his desk.I will summarise some aspects of the Bill, which contain a weakness.  Where does section 159, in essence, the pillar we are debating today, now stand in the amended Bill?  As regards the illegal appointments, if they are validated retrospectively and if members of the board have less than a year to run since their appointment, how will the sequencing be done in future?  The board expires at the end of September 2009 for nine of the ten illegally appointed members and at the end of December 2009 for the tenth.  There is a sequencing difficulty.  When will these people actually be appointed? Are they being reappointed on foot of a new date, or is the Minister giving them a secondary position, whereby their appointment date is also being retrospectively looked at?

Measaim gur cuid den jab atá againn istigh sa Dáil, nuair a n-aithnítear go bhfuil fadhb le reachtaíocht go ndéanaimid an fhadhb sin a réiteach.  Is trua go bhfuil sé á dhéanamh faoi phráinn, mar tá a lán fadhbanna eile agamsa leis an mBille um Thionóntactaí Cónaithe (Leasú) 2009, nó an bun Bhille, 2004, agus ba chóir dúinn féachaint ar siúd chomh maith leis an bun-fhadhb atá anseo.As regards the illegal appointments being retrospectively validated, it is great to be a Minister.  The fact that illegal actions may be validated retrospectively is interesting, and this is not the first time.  Only last year the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government had to act because two councillors, a Fianna Fáil and Green Party councillor, were illegally appointed to the board.  That said, our job is to address faults when we spot them and ensure that a body such as the PRTB is able to function properly and can address the resolutions.  If anything, we should address how to increase the capacity of the PRTB, especially going into the period where landlords will try to change tenancies, tenants will seek to avoid payments and so on.  Yesterday I welcomed the announcement concerning new standards to improve rental accommodation.  I hope the Minister of State will ensure they come into effect quickly because prevention of problems will help the PRTB deal with its enormous workload, enabling it to concentrate on the resolution of disputes.I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will address the problems so that we do not have to come back to the matter of dealing with appointments in future, but rather can concentrate on resource failures.

What was involved here was a procedural error, a tactical flaw which casts no reflection on the quality of the tenancies tribunal convened in the period in question.  The mistake concerned the unexpired portion of the board's membership for those members appointed to the dispute resolution committee, DRC.  There is also doubt as to whether statutory consultation requirements with me, as Minister of State, were properly complied with.  It is purely a technical mistake by the board of the PRTB that did not impact on the quality or professionalism of the tribunal hearings.  The competence and professionalism of the tribunal is not in question.  The procedures adopted were robust and proper and the outcomes and judgments are not in question.  That matter was raised by Deputy Charles Flanagan and the decisions arising out of the invalid composition of the DRC will be secured by this legislation.As of this morning I understand that the decisions have not been challenged.  Nonetheless, there could be grounds for legal challenges as regards the manner in which the PRTB was set up, specifically in terms of time resources and reputation damage, which is why I have urgently moved to  close off this area.  The issue of the invalid appointment of councillors was dealt with in June.  The matter in hand today predates the incorrect appointment of the councillors.  The PRTB has undertaken an audit of compliance with legislative requirements and reported to its board and to me on this.  No similar issues were identified, and I am sure that enhanced corporate governance and oversight processes are now in place.Deputy Hogan raised some serious matters that are of concern to me as well.  I intend to deal with those matters under the housing Bill that will come before the Dáil in a month's time.  It has already gone through all stages in the Seanad.  It would therefore be inappropriate to have those concerns included in emergency legislation, such as this.  However, I intend to address them and look forward to suggestions in that regard, both from Deputy Hogan and Deputy Lynch.  This is new legislation and a new board and the legislation referred to allows for this type of review, in any event.  I hope, we can together see what is best for the legislation in the review of the housing Bill, so that eventually it may be of benefit to the tenant, the landlord, and everybody else.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	364	In reference to the Minister's remarks, it is almost a common occurrence that every week emergency legislation goes through the House in one fashion or another, whether a residency or banking Bill.  The difficulty with crisis-driven legislation is that it may lead to further crises.  For the Minister's benefit I will note some issues he and his departmental staff may make note of.  Earlier in the debate I said the Bill does not refer to section 159(3).  Has this been neutered?  It is a very critical part of the Bill.  This section says, "A member of the board shall not be eligible for appointment as a member of the dispute resolution committee unless the unexpired period of his or her term of office as a member of the board is three or more years at the date of his or her appointment as a member of the committee."  That must be sorted, otherwise we will be back here next week with the same difficulty because we are repeating the mistake.The Bill says retrospectively that appointments shall be deemed to have been validly made.  Does this mean an appointment runs from 7 December 2007, and for what period have they been appointed?  This must be cleared up and I would like the Minister to furnish us with information on this so we are all sure what has happened here today.  For what period have they been appointed?  Their board membership terminates at the end of 2009.  Will they be automatically re-appointed to the board if the three-year requirement period is gone?  That must be sorted out.  It is critical that the Minister explain; we have questions to the Minister next week and that could be a possibility.  I would appreciate if the Minister would explain how this issue came on to his radar.  That is critically important to the operation of this House.  The Minister acknowledged the co-operation he has received from this side of the House regarding the notification that came in yesterday.  I ask the Minister to reciprocate that co-operation by explaining how this came to his attention.Are members of these boards given copies of the Act?  When I was appointed to the Regional Health Forum I received a copy of the Act and the terms of reference which gave the scope of my legal appointment to the board.  One of three things happened here: the members of the board did not receive the Act; they received the Act but did not read it; or the Department officials did not read the Act.  I am reminded of this because it happened with the two councillors' situation being brought up in this House.  The Act was not misinterpreted.  The Act was clear that what we are rectifying today should not have happened.  I am reminded of former US President George W. Bush who babbled about an old saying in Tennessee, or maybe in Texas, that says, "fool me once, shame on you, and you can't fool me again".  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his staff seem to be in that position.  He was trying to say: "Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me."  What we have witnessed here is that the Minister either has not read or does not understand the content of the Residential Tenancies Act.It is critical that the members of the board receive copies of the Act and read it.  It is critical that the audit the Minister says has been carried out in December is bullet-proof so we do not have to return here and that the point I made about section 159 is examined.  Rather than use the Minister's question time next week I would appreciate if the Minister would provide the information.  Given that the PRTB is not covered by the Ombudsman or the Freedom of Information Act, the Minister, being present in the Chamber this evening, and his Department should explain why and how this issue came before him.

The motion makes specific reference to matters that were the subject of criminal proceedings and in regard to which further proceedings are expected.  I remind Members that, under Standing Order 56, a matter should not be raised in an overt manner such that it appears to be an attempt by the Oireachtas to encroach on the functions of the court or a judicial tribunal, and that when permission to raise a matter has been granted, there will continue to be an onus on Members to avoid, if at all possible, comment which might in effect prejudice the outcome of proceedings.  I ask Members to bear these points in mind when making their contributions.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I bring to Members' attention a typographical error in the text of the motion.  The reference to "19th January" should read "21st January".  I understand this error will be corrected in tomorrow's Order Paper.I regret that the Government has deemed fit to table an amendment to this motion rather than simply accepting it.  Unfortunately, this fits into the general conduct of the Government in dealing with issues relating to children.  In the context of the entire area of child care, I have watched with amazement the contribution made to date by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews.  Before Christmas, the Minister of State called on John Magee, the Bishop of Cloyne, to resign in view of his failure to implement child protection guidelines.The failings of Bishop Magee were confined to the Cloyne area, whereas the failings of the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, his predecessors at the Office of the Minister for Children, this Government and all Fianna Fáil-led Governments in the last 12 years in the child care area have impacted on the entirety of the country.  Child protection guidelines have been in place since 1999.  Prior to that, other guidelines were in place which were replaced by the 1999 guidelines.  The reality is that Fianna Fáil-led Governments and a series of Ministers of State with responsibility for children have presided over the Office of the Minister for Children, along with a succession of Ministers for Health and Children presiding over the senior Department, in circumstances in which the 1999 guidelines have been in place but have not been observed.  There is no uniformity of application of the guidelines throughout the State.  If what happened in Cloyne justifies the Minister of State's call for the resignation of Bishop Magee, what has happened throughout the State in the child protection area justifies a call not only on the Minister of State and his predecessors to resign but on the entirety of the Government to do the same.  It is the height of hypocrisy for this Minister of State in particular, who has shown unprecedented incompetence in this brief, to call on others to resign from their positions because of their failings.The tragic case in Roscommon, affecting six children in the family in question, has shone a spotlight on the adequacies of our child care system.  The need for an independent investigation into what occurred, under the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004, cannot be denied.  There is a need to know exactly why these children were condemned to live, for a period of eight years from 1996 to the end of 2004, in circumstances in which no child should be obliged to live.  The Western Health Board should clearly have been aware that intervention was required.  From 1989 onwards, the family was known to be a dysfunctional family with difficulties.The inquiry the Minister of State has sought to put in place is neither independent nor are its terms of reference adequate, being far too narrow to address the issue that must be addressed.  There is a need to inquire into the manner in which the Western Health Board and personnel attached to it addressed issues relating to this family throughout the period they had come to the notice of the board until the end of 2004 when the children were taken into care.  There is a need to address how the Health Service Executive dealt with the children as and from its formation on 1 January 2005 and why it did not at that stage, the children having been taken into care, conduct a review of events that occurred in the preceding years to identify what went wrong and to ensure no repetition.There is a need to inquire into why it is that the Minister of State with responsibility for children, who is supposed to have an overview of what is happening in our child protection services, had no knowledge of any nature of the tragic circumstances of the children in Roscommon until media reports emerged on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning of last week relating to the criminal trial.  There is a serious dysfunction within our child care system.  It is essentially broken.  There is an entire lack of reasonable communication between the Minister of State with responsibility for children, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive which administers the child protection services.  It is astounding that the Minister of State learned of what occurred from media reports.  It is equally astonishing that it took the advent of the criminal trial for the Health Service Executive to conduct its 48-hour initial review.Moreover, it is singly inappropriate that the executive has appointed two members of its staff to the team that is conducting the investigation or review of what occurred.  To call such an entity an independent investigation is a corruption of the English language.  I have no doubt the two staff members concerned are admirable individuals.  Mr. Gerry O'Neill is the national manager with specialist child care responsibilities, while Mr. Paul Harrison is its national child care specialist.  Essentially, however, the executive is being asked to investigate itself.  In no sense of the term can this be regarded as an independent investigation.  If the investigation is to be properly conducted, there are people who will disagree with the approach of the Health Service Executive who should be interviewed by those conducting the inquiry.  It is entirely inappropriate that the executive be involved at that level.  Justice in this matter must not only be done but must be seen to be done.The other two appointees to the investigating team are eminently suitable.  Ms Norah Gibbons is the director of advocacy at Barnardos and Ms Leonie Lunny has worked in this areas in different capacities for years.  If an independent inquiry under the 2004 Act had been announced, comprising these two individuals with perhaps another third independent individual, I would have welcomed it.  The Minister should reconsider what is proposed.  I hope Ms Gibbons and Ms Lunny will also rethink their position in the context of this inquiry.  It is singly inappropriate for it to be structured in this way.The Minister of State will respond that previous inquiries have included health board personnel.  Three such inquiries were conducted during the 1990s, including the inquiry into the death of Kelly Fitzgerald which also resulted from the failure of the Western Health Board to do its job properly.  In all these inquiries, health board personnel were part of the investigating group.  However, there was a key difference in that those involved were from health boards other than the one being investigated.  They were truly independent.  It seems the Minister of State and the Health Service Executive lost sight of the reality that the health board structure was abolished.  The executive is the single body governing the area of child care.  We no longer have eight or 11 different health boards.  However, it seems that when the Minister of State and the executive were considering how to put a group together, they concluded that it would be fine to include executive personnel because past investigations always included nominees from the health boards.  They were nominated from outside health boards.  The HSE is the health authority, therefore, it cannot investigate itself.  It is particularly inappropriate that two of the people involved in the HSE in the child care area conduct this investigation because the HSE has utterly failed to properly apply, in a uniform manner across the country, the Children First child protection guidelines of 1999.A damning independent report commissioned by the Minister's Department, published at the end of July 2008, made it clear that there are huge problems in this area.  This was confirmed in a statement issued by the HSE announcing the formation of this inquiry group.  In announcing its formation, Laverne McGuinness, described as HSE national director of primary, continuing and community care, made reference to the fact that the HSE hopes during the course of this year to start uniformly applying the child care guidelines across the country.  In other words, despite the fact that the Kelly Fitzgerald report, published in 1996, recommended that the then child protection guidelines should be applied uniformly throughout the country — as should the 1999 guidelines — and despite the fact that it also recommended that the application of those guidelines should be monitored by the Office of the Department of Health and Children, namely by the Minister for Health and Children in her Department, neither of those two recommendations was implemented.  In that context, it is completely inappropriate that the HSE be included in this group.The terms of reference for this investigation are too narrow.  They are primarily concerned with the conduct of the HSE.  What is to be examined is the entire management of the case "from a care perspective".  In other words, the HSE will examine how the Western Health Board, and presumably itself, together with Norah Gibbons and Leonie Lunney, dealt with the children in this tragic family.  Those terms of reference do not allow for an investigation into the involvement of schools and school authorities.  Nor do they allow for an assessment to be done of the extent to which the recommendations made in the Kelly Fitzgerald report, published in 1996, were either implemented by the Western Health Board, by the HSE or by the Government.  They should so provide.The terms of reference do not provide for an investigation and for questions to be answered by the alleged shadowy group composed of a number of individuals referred to in the criminal case who facilitated, insisted or encouraged the mother in this instance to seek some form of High Court order.  They do not require that the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of that order be investigated and the nature of the legal advice on which the Western Health Board relied be assessed.  A whole range of issues that this inquiry should investigate and examine are excluded.  The terms of reference also do not expressly include examining the contact doctors and nurses had with these children; the extent to which they made reports that these children were at risk; if reports were made, how they were responded to and followed up; and the extent to which reports were ignored.The inquiry can deal with what the Western Health Board did but there is no basis within it for doctors and nurses to talk to those conducting the inquiry.  There is no basis under which health board personnel, who formerly worked for the Western Health Board and are no longer employees of the HSE, can be required to co-operate with this inquiry.  Those conducting it have no powers to serve subpoenas or to take evidence in a manner envisaged in the 2004 Act.  As a consequence, this inquiry will not do the job that is required in the interests of protecting children, nor in the public interest.  It is essential that this job is done properly and correctly.In context of the inquiry being conducted, it is essential that it happens and that the issues are addressed, but I am heartily sick of the failures in our child care services which place children at risk, which result in children suffering and enduring harm for long periods during which it should never have occurred and for the fact that we produce reports that make substantive recommendations that are never implemented and nothing ever changes.  I have before me the Kelly Fitzgerald report, a huge report that the Western Health Board, on its publication, pledged to implement.  It was received by the Western Health Board in 1995 and it attempted to suppress its publication.  I was a member of an Oireachtas joint committee that compelled its publication and ensured that in April 1996 it became public knowledge.  This report contains a plethora of recommendations, some of which were the responsibility of the health board to implement and some of which were the responsibility of Government to do so.  Most of those that fell within the responsibility of Government were never implemented.  Clearly, from what occurred in this tragic family, many that were supposed to apply to the Western Health Board were not implemented.There is no purpose in our having investigations and reports which contain recommendations if they are going to be ignored.  There is no value in this investigation unless there is a look-back as to why the Western Health Board did not do what it should have done and why at the same time as this report became public knowledge the Western Health Board was dealing with children in this family and failing them.  I do not want to hear anyone tell me that the reason the Western Health Board did not act sooner and take these children into care is because of constitutional difficulties.  I have been advocating a constitutional referendum to protect the rights of children and explicitly recognise them for many years.  I hope, ultimately, that we will have that referendum.Last summer the Minister poured cold water on the need for a referendum and widely briefed that perhaps we should not have one.  Irrespective of whether we do or do not need one, the absence of the type of changes we need in our Constitution is not the cause of the problems of these children in Roscommon.  Section 18 of the Child Care Act 1991 gave the health board more than adequate powers to intervene and take these children into care.  The child protection guidelines of 1999 set the parameters of what should have happened.  Neither was properly applied.  Those failures are not only a failure by the health board but of Government to ensure that matters are properly dealt with and monitored.I want to cite one sentence from a key recommendation in the Kelly Fitzgerald report, published in 1996.  It states that we recommend that the Department of Health adopt a proactive approach in monitoring health boards' child care developments in order to ensure consistency on a national scale, both in provision and in respect of procedures and practice.  To this day, that has not been implemented.  If it had been, these children caught in these tragic circumstances might have been spared some of the dreadful abuse that they suffered.It is in the public interest that we get full answers to all these questions.  The worst of all worlds would be that this inquiry commences, determines that its terms of reference are inadequate, a report is produced that deals with a portion of the issues and a further inquiry proves necessary.  That should not happen.A series of events with regard to children and to the brief exercised by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, sadly illustrate that he is seriously out of his depth.  The Government only responds to issues relating to children when matters that have gone seriously wrong are exposed in the media.  It seems there is no mechanism in place between the Minister's Department and the HSE whereby alarm bells ring at a point in time where something has gone wrong to ensure corrective action is taken and reviews are conducted.I believe there are many other instances of children at risk where there has been a failure to properly intervene.  We know that there are hundreds of instances of children reported to be at risk of abuse whose files are sitting on shelves in the offices of the HSE without social workers allocated to conduct the necessary assessments and without the necessary intervention taking place.I have some sympathy for social workers.  Many social workers in the child care system are working in circumstances that are intolerable.  They have too high a case load, do not get adequate training and do not always get the legal back up they require.  The report published at the end of July was a damning indictment of the failure of the HSE to ensure that social workers in the child care area get the necessary in-service training.I am sorry to say the Minister of State's history, and that of his predecessors in the Department of Health and Children — I campaigned to have the Department of Children set up — do not give rise to any great sense of optimism that the Department is contributing in this area in the way it should.  It has become too interested in public relations.  One of the central roles of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and young people should be to ensure that where children are at risk child protection services work properly, that where information is required in order to make policy the information is on hand, and that there is real time information about the workings of our child care system.  None of these currently exists.The failings of the HSE and the incapacity of the Minister of State to ensure we have an efficient service are clearly illustrated by the fact we are now in January 2009 and, despite its statutory obligations, the HSE has not yet published its report on the child care services for 2007.  It sneaked its 2006 report onto its website in October 2008.  If the Minister of State is to make policy in 2009, he will be relying on information from a report relating to 2006.  That is totally inappropriate.There is further significant hypocrisy concerning lack of communication and other issues the Minister of State has engaged in with the bishops.  In the past few days there has been much publicity about the Minister of State meeting with the bishops and seeking to ensure the audit made on different dioceses will have information added that had been missing.  This concerns part 5 of the questionnaire that was issued by the HSE.  That section was one of the most vital parts of the audit as it sought to ascertain how many allegations of child sexual abuse had been made against members of the clergy, and the extent to which such allegations had been reported properly to the civil authorities by the church authorities in individual dioceses.  It was essentially a statistical question.  When the audit was finally published we discovered that the bishops had failed to answer that question.  It became an issue about the credibility and value of the audit.  All of a sudden the Minister became proactive to solve the problem.  It was as if he had only discovered there was a difficulty when the audit landed on his desk.When the documentation was published relating to that audit we discovered that in May 2007 the HSE had written to the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who was then Minister of State with responsibility for children and young people, pointing out that bishops across the country were not responding to that section of the audit and were saying they had legal difficulties.  Instead of an intervention by the then Minister of State or, subsequently, by Deputy Brendan Smith in the same position, nothing happened at Government level.  Nobody actually cared.  It did not matter.  Only when publicity resulted exposing the lack of value of the audit and the difficulties that had arisen, did the Minister of State engage in some form of discussion, 18 months after being notified by the HSE of the difficulties it was experiencing in the conduct of the audit.  That matter is not something for which the HSE can be criticised.I will finish by referring to one final issue.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	370	In the context of the motion we are discussing I noticed that the Minister of State has tabled an amendment in predictable self-congratulatory terms.  One of the things he wishes us to do is to acknowledge the steps being taken by him in "co-ordinating and leading policy development and actions to bring about improvements in the delivery of services for children".  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State explain why, 12 years after child protection guidelines were put in place, they are still not uniformly applied across the country.  I do not know what lead role his Department is playing.The Minister of State concludes by commending the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  I am a member of that committee, in company with Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  The Minister of State commends, in particular, the recommendation included in the committee's interim report of 11 September 2008 regarding publication of legislation in respect of "the collection and exchange of information concerning the risk or the occurrence of endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse of children".In other words, the Minister welcomes and commends the committee for the publication of its report on soft information.  What he failed to tell the House is that, across party lines and unanimously, the report recommended and asked Government to publish that legislation before Christmas 2008.  That legislation does not even appear in the Government's programme of Bills to be published before Easter.  It is in the category of "heads of Bills to be prepared".  In commending the committee on another vital issue relating to child sexual abuse, the Minister and the Government have proved themselves incapable of delivering the legislation with the urgency required.  They are also incapable of complying with the request made by the all-party committee which includes members of the Minister's party.I hope that between now and tomorrow evening the Government will reconsider the need to have a truly independent investigation, with broader terms of reference.  I hope the two truly independent individuals who were appointed to this committee will give further consideration to the inappropriateness of the committee's composition and that they will consider the need to change substantially its terms of reference.  This is required in order to ensure that the broad range of issues be investigated, in full and properly, and that it be reported upon, as demanded by the public interest and the interests of children.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I thank Deputy Shatter for placing this very important motion before the House.What has become known as the Roscommon incest case is a tragedy for all concerned.  It is a case that generates anger, revulsion and pity in equal measure.  More than any other emotion, sympathy should be to the forefront of our reactions: sympathy for the children let down by the system and also sympathy for the mother who was left adrift to cope with the difficulties and addictions that drove her to commit unmentionable crimes against her own children and the innocence of childhood.It is debatable whether a custodial sentence for the mother of these unfortunate children is the correct response.  This sentence may make us all feel better.  Justice has been seen to have been done.  Or has it?  What is justice in this case?  We have a situation where a mother, the perceived protector of her family, apparently abused the trust placed in her to protect her children from all harm and to provide them with a loving and caring home.  However, rather than pointing the finger at this poor unfortunate woman who was crying out for help that was not there surely the Government and the HSE deserve to stand in the dock, accused by all of gross neglect of these children and their mother.No woman who has received the necessary help to overcome addiction and abnormal behaviour will deliberately set out to harm her children.  On the other hand, this poor unfortunate is a different matter.  She is the victim of adverse circumstances who had nowhere to turn for help.  This woman has offended public morality but how much she is responsible is open to debate  What about her rights to the full benefit of social services?  These were conspicuously absent in this case, both for the mother and for the unfortunate children.  Perhaps we should say that this woman is more to be pitied than condemned and we should look to our collective consciences to see how the system let her down and how we can ensure that such a tragedy will never occur again.The chain of errors that led to these children being left in an appalling position cannot be brushed under the carpet.  It is not enough for the Minister of State with responsibility for children and young people to say after the event that the health service staff should have taken these children into care "an awful lot sooner".  What he, the relevant Minister of State, should be asking, loudly, is why they were not taken into care.  Could the Minister meet those six children, look them in the eye and say she, as the person charged with their welfare, did her best for them?  I think not.  As with the extensive litany of failures she has presided over, platitudes after the event only serve to highlight the inadequacies of the Minister's tenure and the buck passing which goes on between herself and the HSE.This situation is a major indictment of the refusal of the Government to draw up plans for a referendum on children's rights.  What does it take to force the Government to acknowledge its duty to our children and to copper-fasten their right to safety?  Lip service is periodically paid to such a need and becomes more vocal as need arises, only to fade away again until the next outrage is publicised.  No Government can claim to have the well-being of its children at heart that refuses to put every possible constitutional, legislative and administrative protection in place to ensure their safety.  It appears that in the Ireland of the 21st century, the child is invisible and his or her voice is never heard.This country is on its knees, with its head hanging low in terms of the horrors unleashed on its children.  While clerical abuse has been the main focus of our outrage and horror, surely the abuse of innocent children in their own home by the main nurturing figure, under the eyes of the authorities, is beyond comprehension.  Where was the concern of the people involved in the day-to-day lives of the children, who had nobody to give them support?  Did their immediate family, their neighbours, their friends' parents and their teachers not feel that action needed to be taken?  Surely their concerns should have radiated out to the wider circle of the HSE, care workers, gardaí and others.Have we become so isolated in our own worlds, cocooned in the pursuit of our own advancement, that we can no longer see what is right in front of us, and the suffering that is obviously being experienced by some in our midst?  The breakdown of communities and a sense of community is facilitating abuse to be carried out before our eyes but we do not or choose not to notice.  The sooner we acknowledge that intervention and meddling are two separate actions, and allow that concern, not malicious intent, drives most calls for action, the better for our children.While the Minister and the HSE must shoulder the ultimate blame for this horror, legal obstacles faced by health service personnel are a major contributory factor.  The Constitution rightly favours parents over third parties but we must acknowledge and act on the fact families can be extremely dangerous places for children to grow up in.  It is unbelievable that 16 years have passed since Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, as she then was, recommended a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of children in the family.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness's recommendations arose from her legitimate contention that the high emphasis on the rights of the family in the Constitution may consciously, or unconsciously, be interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents than to the rights of the children.  These recommendations arose from the Kilkenny incest case but it will take the Roscommon incest case to finally see them acted upon.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I congratulate Deputy Shatter on bringing forward the motion.  It is a scandal it had to be brought forward but not unexpected when one knows the way our systems work.  It is shocking and disturbing to see what these six children have come through, and it is clear they suffered much abuse and many difficulties.  Although they were attending school and were out in public, nobody cried stop.  It is a scandalous situation about which one must ask many questions.The biggest question is why the Minister, when she was putting forward an inquiry into this situation, chose two people from the HSE to inquire into the HSE itself.  I support Deputy Shatter very strongly on this issue.  As one who has experience of many inquiries in the north east, I know it is very important that one has people who cannot be questioned.  I do not doubt the ability of those two people from the HSE as I do not know either of them.  However, the bottom line is that they are staff members of the HSE and, as such, they have certain loyalties.  I would not be happy that they would inquire into a situation such as this.One must ask where were all of those who were in contact with these children on a daily or weekly basis, namely, the church, teachers, neighbours and, above all, the services.  As one who has been much involved with the services for other reasons, I unfortunately know better than most how they work.  They have such an administrative structure that it is hard for those at the coalface to get support or, as Deputy Shatter said, to get the training they need for such situations.  It is vital, and has been often said, that this should be the last straw.  We must get our structures right and the HSE must learn from this.  It is important the different organisations that could have had contact with these children, whether they are educational organisations or otherwise, would not allow such a situation to happen again.I could point to the legal situation.  In a statement sometime ago, Deputy Shatter noted that in November 2006 the report of the Joint Committee on Child Protection was published and contained 62 different recommendations with regard to sexual offences against children.  Among those recommendations is one that the criminal law in this area be substantially reformed and codified into a single statute.  While this issue has been around for many years, we find that the court decision to impose sentences was made based on an Act of 1908.The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and the senior Minister, Deputy Harney, must work to have this Act updated.  They have an extremely important opportunity available to them, whereby they are entitled to give leadership.  They are the two people in the most exalted situation as far as these children are concerned.  The Minister and the Minister of State have the power not just to sit on legislation but to get it made.  As was seen this afternoon, if legislation is needed, my party will support it wholeheartedly.  I appeal to the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children to re-examine what is being done and to re-examine the management structures in place, which are so top heavy that ordinary staff believe they are left in a very vulnerable situation.  The people who will get the blame are possibly those at level of social workers and I have a good deal of sympathy for them, as I have dealt with them in other cases.  Their hands are tied and they are subject to all types of regulation.  I appeal to the Minister and Minister of State to get to grips with the administrative structure which has been allowed to continue.  Recently, I drove into a car park in St. Davnet's complex, County Monaghan, and I could not believe the number of cars I saw there and, by extension, the number of administrators working.  This is at a time when I cannot arrange for home help or any other service for which there is no money available.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"in expressing its deepest concern at the circumstances surrounding the case of incest, severe child abuse and neglect involving six children heard before Roscommon Circuit Court last week:welcomes the HSE's setting up of an independent inquiry into these appalling events to:examine the entire management of the case from a care perspective;identify any shortcomings-deficits in the care management process; andmake a report on the findings and learning arising from the investigation;acknowledges the extremely difficult and complex work carried out by HSE staff in the area of child protection in particular;recognises the HSE's work to reform child and family services which includes commitments to:put in place national standards relating to social work and its practice; andwork with the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to advance social work practice and organisational reform in the context of the Government's overall policy for children's services — the ‘Agenda for Children Services';acknowledges the steps being taken by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in co-ordinating and leading policy development and actions to bring about improvements in the delivery of services for children within its specific policy remit and across the public service;commends investments in the provision of services for children which have been made by recent Governments since 1997; andcommends the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, chaired by Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, T.D., and, in particular, the recommendation included in the committee's interim report of 11 September 2008 with regard to the preparation and publication of legislation to give legal authority for the collection and exchange of information concerning the risk or the occurrence of endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse of children."I welcome the opportunity provided by this debate to reflect on the very important issue of child welfare and protection services, which is a subject of concern not only to the House, but to the whole country.In the first instance, I put on record that the provision of appropriate, robust and responsive child welfare and protection services is a key priority for both me, as Minister  of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, and the Government.  The substantial media coverage of this area in the past year, most recently in the case of the recent appalling case heard before Roscommon Circuit Court last week, has provoked a public debate concerning these important issues during which voice has been given to a number of legitimate concerns, especially in the area of service provision.  It would, however, be remiss to isolate the issue of service provision in this regard.  While I would not suggest that the State can absolve itself of responsibility in any circumstances, an equally key consideration in the area of child welfare and protection is that of wider societal responsibility.  It is the responsibility of each and every individual in Ireland to play their part in protecting our children from harm.  Without such vigilance on the part of every sector of society, we risk placing all responsibility on our child welfare and protection services.  Child welfare and protection is a major concern for everyone in society, not only those individuals who work in these services.  This message must be sent out clearly from all sides of this House.I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Máire Hoctor.Everyone in the House will be familiar with the horrific case of incest, sexual abuse and child abuse heard before Roscommon Circuit Court last week.  I wish to express my absolute shock and revulsion at the circumstances surrounding this case, which involved perhaps the most serious form of any abuse, that of a mother against her own children.  It is critical that we move quickly to find out what exactly happened in this case and why it happened.  The children at the centre of this case were undoubtedly failed by society on this occasion and the lessons of what went wrong must be learnt.  The sentence handed down in the case by Judge Miriam Reynolds was the maximum that could be imposed under the act.  It was thought inconceivable in 1908 that a mother could inflict such suffering on her own child and hence the difference in sentencing between a mother and father.Immediately upon becoming aware of this case, I contacted the Health Service Executive which undertook to provide me with a report on the matter within 48 hours.  In particular, I asked the HSE to provide a chronology of contact and interventions with the family and a full account of the approach taken in pursuance of the child care order and the legal issues surrounding the High Court injunction.  The HSE informed me that this particular case was extremely complex and difficult in nature.  The Western Health Board and, in more recent times, the HSE had been, and continues to be, directly involved with the family and that support remains in place.  The members of the family who are under 18 years of age have been in the care of the HSE since late 2004 under care orders granted by the courts.  Notwithstanding this ongoing contact with the family involved, the HSE further informed me that a preliminary investigation was under way, the results of which I received last Saturday afternoon.The review was carried out by a senior HSE manager from outside County Roscommon and on the basis of the findings of the review the HSE, on Saturday last, 24 January 2009, confirmed that it is to undertake a detailed investigation into the events surrounding this case.  The investigation team will be independently chaired by Ms Norah Gibbons, director of advocacy with Barnardos.  The other members of the investigation team are Ms Leonie Lunny, the former chief executive of the Citizens Information Board, Mr. Paul Harrison, a national child care specialist with the HSE, and Mr. Gerry O'Neill, the HSE's national manager with specialist child care responsibility.The independently chaired investigation team will examine the entire management of the case from a care perspective with a view to identifying any shortcomings or deficits in the care management process and to make a report on the findings and learning arising from their investigation.  The investigation is expected to be complete within six months and the HSE has stated its intention to publish the report in full, taking into consideration important issues around natural justice and the sensitivities of the case.  The HSE has informed me that it is fully committed to ensuring that all learning and all actions considered necessary following the completion of this investigation will happen in an expedient and appropriate manner.The comments by the HSE's national director of primary, continuing and community care to the media have indicated that the HSE is determined to fully establish what "we did not do, how were we wrong and where things should have been done better".  In this regard, far from not learning the lessons spelt out by previous reports into other tragic cases, as has been suggested, these feed into the constant development and updating of policy in this area.  That will also be the case with the findings of this new investigation.  This learning has been given practical effect through the publication of the children first guidelines, the establishment of both the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the implementation of the Children's Act 2001.Several questions have been raised in recent days about the independence of the investigating team.  I have had the opportunity to meet with Ms Gibbons, the independent chair of the investigating team, on several occasions since becoming the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, and I can state without reservation that I have every confidence in her professionalism and integrity to deliver a comprehensive report which will point out the learning that is required.  In carrying out the investigation, I am certain that she will ensure that no stone is left unturned in the team's search for the full facts in this matter.  As regards the HSE representation on the group, I note and welcome the public comments by Mr. Fergus Finlay of Barnardos, who stated his view on RTE radio last Friday that he did not believe there could be any possible vested interest in covering up the truth, and that he would be astonished if either of the HSE's representatives on the group had the remotest interest in any kind of cover up.  Having met Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Harrison on several occasions since taking up office, I fully endorse these remarks.I welcome the announcement today by the Irish Association of Young People in Care of its support of the investigation and its independence.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the review group.  I reiterate that it is a HSE-commissioned review and that I, as the Minister with responsibility in this matter, and the Government, retain the right to carry out any further investigations deemed necessary in this case.  I will keep this position under review.To conclude my remarks on this case, under the Childcare Act 1991, one must protect the details relating to children arising from a case involving a care order.  In terms of public debate, this constraint means that the circumstances surrounding the criminal trial are known, but nothing can be revealed about HSE care orders.  I also understand that further criminal charges in respect of the family circumstances surrounding this case are pending and therefore sub judice.One cannot, however, consider an individual child welfare case outside the wider context of child welfare and protection issues.  In this regard, I take the opportunity provided by this debate to reflect on some of the important steps driving reform in this area.  In recent years, we have seen a period of major investment in child care and family support services to enable an appropriate response to child welfare concerns.  To this end, more than €240 million of Government funds have been added to the annual investment in child care services since 1997.In addition, a significant number of additional social work posts have been created since 2004, culminating in the recent recruitment process undertaken by the HSE, which was the first social work recruitment process undertaken on a national basis.  There has also been an increase in funding of family support services of 79%, from €45.7 million in 2003 to €81.8 million in 2008.  As regards the issue of emergency cases arising outside normal working hours, the HSE has recently put a system in place which provides for access by the Garda to strategically placed foster carers nationwide, where emergency placement is required for children out of hours.  Foster families are currently being recruited for this service.  Initiatives such as those I have mentioned, as well as others such as the prevention and early intervention programme for children and the establishment of the children's services committees, reflect the commitment of the Government and the HSE to the ongoing implementation of the national children's strategy and, most recently, the agenda for children's services.The HSE has made and continues to make significant advances in many areas of children's services.  For example, in respect of special care and high support, that is, dealing with the neediest children in HSE care, there now is a well-managed national approach in operation.  Further initiatives are under way in the HSE to make residential care services more efficient and effective and to enhance foster care services available by way of highly supported multidimensional foster care.  This will enable more difficult cases to be maintained in the community, which is where I wish to see the delivery of more services with the appropriate supports.The core principle underpinning all of these reforms and additional funding is to provide children and young people with the highest possible quality of care and to provide services to protect them, as far as possible, from all forms of harm.  Since taking up office as Minister of State, in all my contacts I have stressed the priority which both the Government and I place on the need to provide appropriate services to some of the most vulnerable young members of our society.  In this regard, my aim is improvements in child welfare and protection services based on appropriate standards for Ireland.  I realise this goal will present many significant challenges in areas such as resources and service reform.  To further advance this aim, I have initiated a series of regular meetings on child welfare and protection issues between senior officials of the HSE and my office at which issues such as service reform and modernisation, including out of hours service provision, as well as any necessary legislative reform, are and will be discussed to drive change and monitor actions for the improvement of child welfare and protection services.With the recent transition from the historical organisation boundaries of the health boards to the new HSE structure and with the establishment three years ago of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, inadequacies have been highlighted with the flow of information and knowledge within and across organisational boundaries and particularly in respect of the complex area of child welfare and protection.

The development of a knowledge management strategy for child welfare and protection, which was embarked on by my office, is a key initiative to address these issues.  I became acutely aware that communication difficulties, deficits in information and the absence of standardised procedures can impede service responsiveness with potentially serious consequences for some children.

To date, policy makers, HSE senior managers, front-line service managers and practitioners, academics and other bodies have engaged actively with my office in outlining the information and knowledge streams currently in place, in identifying the gaps and weaknesses and in making recommendations for improvements.

During all this work, we found there is a very strong collective desire among all the stakeholders to improve, standardise and to collaborate in streamlining information——

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	413	My intention is to use the knowledge management approach to protect children from failures caused by agencies working in isolation from one another without effective communication and co-ordination; inconsistent quality of front line procedures; and inconsistent management oversight.  I am confident this knowledge management strategy when implemented as a process, will be a key support to planned reforms in the child welfare and protection area.At this point I wish to place on record my appreciation for the work carried out by social work teams and their management.  These individuals are hard working, dedicated professionals who must deal with cases on a daily basis that are becoming ever more difficult, complex and intractable.  I note the HSE is evaluating allocations of resources around the country to achieve a more equitable and efficient distribution of staff and skills for the social work service.  I also should note that not all services for children at risk need be provided by social workers.  The HSE provides a multiplicity of services, which can address effectively the needs of children at risk.  Therapy, medical, nursing, psychological, community care and a wide range of services benefiting children at risk are provided.  In addition, non-governmental bodies provide key services for children and families at risk on behalf of or in tandem with HSE services in areas such as residential care, foster care, community mentoring, as well as family support such as the Springboard, teen parenting and youth advocacy programmes, as well as many other areas.The focus for development in the coming years is on preventive, community-based services which provide early intervention within a community care context.  The development of alternative care services will, over time, affect the numbers of children in residential and foster care.  International and Irish research indicates that in many situations, cases can best be dealt with by way of welfare and care services, which again do not always require full time social worker input to work well, rather than by way of referral straight to child protection services.The agenda for children's services is the new overarching policy document of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for these areas and was launched in December 2007.  The agenda, with its clear renewed emphasis on family support coupled with reflective questions to enable service provider self-evaluation, represents the fundamental change now under way on how Government policy on children is formulated and delivered.  It has been developed drawing on research and best practice at home and internationally.  It requires outcomes focus and integrated service delivery in line with the recommendations of the recent OECD report.  To help implement the policy and principles in the agenda, at the instigation of my office the HSE has commenced the process of specifying a child welfare services implementation policy.  This is vital to effective reform and rebalancing of children's services.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is represented on the steering group for the development of this operational policy working conjointly with the HSE.Another significant feature of media coverage on recent cases has been the call for a constitutional referendum on the rights of the child.  All society is judged on how it treats the most vulnerable and the Government is committed to ensuring that the vulnerable children and young people of Ireland are given the full protection of the Irish Constitution.  This Government has been proactive in pursuing this ideal since before the publication of the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill in February 2007.  The Bill, which resulted from extensive consultations and discussions by the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, contains a number of proposals to amend the Constitution in respect of children that cover diverse areas such as children's rights, adoption, collection and exchange of soft information and absolute and strict liability.The programme for Government of June 2007 contained a commitment to deepening consensus on the proposed constitutional amendment and as a result, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children was established in November 2007 under the chairmanship of Deputy O'Rourke.  Consensus on this important issue is considered imperative in order that the Oireachtas can communicate to the public a considered and united approach on any proposed amendment to the Constitution.  As one of my predecessors in the Department, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated "this is to ensure that the Constitution, the fundamental law of our land, reflects the often quoted commitment to value and protect childhood".The provisions of this Bill are complex and go to the heart of individual rights and the family unit.  Our efforts must concentrate on achieving consensus on how best to strengthen the rights of children while maintaining a careful balance with other important principles already contained in the Constitution which, we believe, are as important in protecting and safeguarding children.  These include the duties of parents and the regard in which the family is held.  Much of the deliberation in discussing an appropriate wording has involved ensuring there is no dilution of these equally important concepts.The approach the Government has taken to date on the establishment of the joint committee and the development of its terms of reference emphasise the Government's desire to get it right, while also working to bring proposals for constitutional change to the people if necessary.  This consensus approach is continuing in the work of the committee as it has deliberated on what are complex and sensitive social and criminal issues.  Indeed, the work of the committee has proved so onerous that it has, to date, been given two extensions to its original deadline in order to complete its work.  More than 140 written submissions have been received by the committee, and it is also engaged in hearing oral submissions.Over the course of the committee's work many high profile, sensitive and, indeed, disturbing court cases have been to the fore.  While these cases may impinge on the core subject matter of the work of the committee, it has been my experience, as an ex officio member of the committee, that these cases, while the subject of much debate, have not deflected committee members from a consensus approach to issues that are central to child protection and welfare.  The complexity of the family and criminal law aspects of the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007 have resulted in diverse and polarised commentary, but never once has the all-party membership of the committee wavered in its commitment to achieving the aim of enhancing and protecting the lives of Irish children.I have welcomed the interim report into the collection of soft information and, in co-operation with my Government colleagues, I have commenced the process of preparing the relevant legislation.  Work is under way on the drafting of the heads of this Bill and I am pleased to announce that it is part of the Government's legislative programme for the spring session 2009, which was published yesterday by the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey.The committee has also given the issue of absolute and strict liability, as dealt with in Articles 42 A 5.2 and 5.3 of the proposed amendment, extensive consideration.  I am hopeful that the committee will conclude its deliberations on absolute and strict liability shortly and that a second interim report on this specific issue may be finalised and submitted to the Oireachtas shortly, which will allow the Government to move forward on this important issue.The committee will then focus on the remaining family law aspects of the proposed constitutional amendment with a view to finalising its work and presenting a final report to both Houses of the Oireachtas by its deadline of 9 April 2009.  When the work of this committee is concluded, the protection and welfare of Irish children will be significantly enhanced by legislation, regulatory change and constitutional amendment, as appropriate, so that the laws of our land properly reflect our commitment to value and protect children.  I am firmly of the opinion that consensus must be built between the parties represented on the joint Oireachtas committee before any definite decision can be taken on the holding of a constitutional referendum.I once again reiterate the Government's commitment to address the crucial challenge of protecting the most vulnerable members of our society.  When families fail children for whatever reason, the children must be protected by society and the State and this is a complex and difficult task.

I also echo his remarks regarding the shock we all feel about the case heard before Roscommon Circuit Court last week.  The issues this case raises are truly harrowing and should serve as a warning to everyone that the utmost vigilance is required from all if we are to face up to issues surrounding the protection of vulnerable children.The Minister of State highlighted a number of recent and ongoing service reform issues.  In this regard I would also highlight some other worthwhile initiatives of recent times.  The first of these is the innovative prevention and early intervention programme which was announced by the then Minister of State with responsibility for children in 2006.  This programme examines innovative methods for improving outcomes for children in an integrated way and is scheduled to run for a five year period.  Funding amounting to €36 million in total has been provided by Government and Atlantic Philanthropies for the programme, which is being managed by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, OMCYA.  To date, service level agreements have been agreed between the OMCYA and projects based in Tallaght, Ballymun and the northside communities of Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview.The model underpinning this programme is based on evidence of need in the community and an evidence based approach to what works.  This approach is gained from professional and personal experience, research literature from successful models tested elsewhere as well as needs assessment on the ground.  It is outcome oriented in that it is driven by the benefits or changes for individuals or populations during or after participating in the programme activities.  A key element is the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the outcomes of the activities undertaken and learning from the individual sites.  This evaluation is intended to promote a process of continuous improvement and helps to assess what interventions work best and how and where they can be best employed in improving delivery of services or the development of new policy.  It should also guide the reorientation of current services where the evidence indicates that this should happen.The second innovation I want to highlight this evening, and another significant step forward in the harmonisation of service provision in the area of child welfare and protection service provision, has been the establishment of children's services committees.  The Towards 2016 national partnership agreement made provision for the establishment of a high-level group chaired by the OMCYA, now known as the National Children's Strategy Implementation Group.  The group was established in November 2006 and its membership is drawn from the relevant Departments, the HSE, representatives of local authorities, the education sector and other key agencies.The key priority of the group is to ensure implementation of the many strategic plans and policy documents, which have already been drawn up and published, on children's services in Ireland.  It must ensure integration of service delivery, cross-sectoral working and the joint implementation of children policies and initiatives.As part of the process of achieving this goal, the group approved the establishment of four multi-agency children's services committees, CSCs.  The sites chosen for the initial roll-out of the committees were in Dublin city, south Dublin, Donegal and Limerick city.  These committees have now been established and a framework for advancing their work has been agreed.  The aim of this initiative is to test models of best practice which promote integrated, locally led, strategic planning for children's services.  The National Children's Strategy Implementation Group is working to provide guidance and practical assistance to each of the committees.It is hoped to set up at least four new children's services committees in 2009 and proposals have been requested from interested parties and the OMCYA is continuing to work closely with potential sites for phase III.The policy initiatives and actions I have been referring to are important for child welfare and protection because they promise action to intervene to prevent issues developing to the point where they become child protection problems.  The solution these initiatives offer include better service integration and co-ordination, improved communication and a better understanding built up among all service providers of each other's roles and skills based on shared goals and outcomes.On 30  July last, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, launched the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs's national review of compliance with the Children First  guidelines.  This review was part of the Government’s response to the publication of the Ferns report and was carried out by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in partnership with all relevant Departments.  In the course of the review, many areas of good practice were identified, and much positive feedback was received.  However, in some areas slower progress was identified, including, in particular, around the principles of integrating family support with the child protection service, and integrating the voice of the child into the service.The findings suggested that while the guidelines themselves presented a good framework for the protection of children, there were a number of areas that needed to be reviewed.  Key difficulties were identified arising from a lack of consistency, an absence of a comprehensive local, regional or national structure to plan, monitor and evaluate the child protection services and from a lack of availability of key services and supports.The key finding of the review was that, in general, difficulties and variations in implementation of the guidelines arose as a result of local variation and infrastructural issues, rather than from fundamental difficulties with the guidelines themselves.  Accordingly, it has been decided not to revise fundamentally or replace the guidelines, but to give priority to issues of consistency in implementation and the development of standards.  While there is a stated intention to reissue the guidelines, the substance and principles will remain unchanged.The purpose of the guidelines when they were first published in 1999 was to protect children.  Responsibility for protecting children must be shared among everyone, including the statutory and non-statutory sectors, teachers, parents and neighbours.  It is the responsibility of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs to ensure that national policy for the protection and welfare of children is articulated as robustly as possible in the national guidelines and is implemented effectively and consistently across all sectors of society.  This is a responsibility that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, along with everyone in Government, takes seriously.There have been a number of recent developments in respect of child protection, most notably the publication of the reports relating to the Cloyne diocese and the recent tragic child abuse court case in County Roscommon.  Further significant reports are expected to be published, including the Monageer report, the report of the Dublin diocese commission and the Department of Education and Science report from the child abuse inquiry.  Everyone would agree that it makes sense that the implications of these reports for our national guidelines on the protection and welfare of children should be fully considered and, therefore, it is intended to hold off on the re-issue of the guidelines until the necessary information is available and what is learned from these reports can be integrated into the guidelines.I understand that, as part of the HSE publicity campaign on child protection issues undertaken to implement one of the recommendations of the Ferns inquiry, the HSE is due to publish a booklet shortly that will assist the public in dealing with child welfare and protection concerns in line with Children First.I echo the remark of the Minister of State to the effect that, while the State does not absolve itself of responsibility, child protection is everyone's concern.  Issues must be reported and followed up, an outcome that everyone in society can help to achieve within the service providers, which must be responsive and act expeditiously to calm people's concerns and address problems before they become crises.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this worrying and troubling issue.  With the nation, the House shares a sense of shock and horror at six children who were robbed of their childhoods and endured unimaginable suffering within our community.  My heart goes out to them because we cannot restore what was taken from them.  The House shares this feeling collectively.That the matter should be fully, comprehensively and swiftly investigated goes without saying.  What is at issue is the shape and scope of the investigation.  The HSE has appointed a four-person team of inquiry led by the highly respected director of advocacy at Barnardos, Ms Norah Gibbons.  Each member of the team brings an important and relevant set of skills and expertise to the task set him or her and is considerably respected.  None of these facts is at issue in tonight's debate.In March 1993, a father was convicted of rape and incest in the Central Criminal Court.  The details of the case, which became known as the Kilkenny incest case, gave rise to an outrage similar to that surrounding this most recent case.  I was the Minister for Health at the time.  I asked then senior counsel, Ms Catherine McGuinness, to lead the investigation into that awful event.  The investigation included the head social worker with the former Eastern Health Board, a medical officer of health from the former Midlands Health Board and a senior administrator from the former South Eastern Health Board, the board directly involved.  When the report was produced, it was a model of its kind.  It was published within approximately two months and debated in the House at the end of May 1993.  The report's recommendations are still relevant to this debate.Deputy Shatter referred to the Kelly Fitzgerald report, which followed some years later.  Equally, it is worthy of debate within the context of this discussion.  Unfortunately, we do not have time for a broader debate.  The fact that the 1993 report was drafted in a way that avoided publicly identifying the victim, her family or the various professionals involved enabled me to publish it in full and immediately.The Minister of State did not initiate this team of inquiry.  Rather, by his request, that was done by the HSE.  The team is modelled on the 1993 initiative.  All these years later, Deputy Shatter makes a compelling and unanswerable point, namely, that matters have moved on.  There is a clear public requirement that no organ of State or group of individuals can inquire into its own activities.  In terms of politicians, we set up the Standards in Public Office Commission.  After years of arguing, we established the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  Regarding doctors, the Medical Council has a lay majority and so on.  Confidence in the outcome of any investigation is critical.  The voices and needs of victims must be heard and factored into the equation.  We need an inquiry that is speedy, but thorough, comprehensive and, above all, has public confidence.If the proposal tabled by Deputy Shatter is not acceptable, it may be possible to reconstitute or reshape the existing group.  In essence, the Kilkenny incest case was an inquiry conducted by Ms Catherine McGuinness, senior counsel, with a plethora of supporters who knew the map of the minefield, what questions to ask and how to go about it, including a medical doctor, a senior social worker and so on.  It may be possible to reconstitute the current group, with the investigative team comprising Ms Norah Gibbons and supporters, as with a commission of inquiry in which there is a sole member assisted by a team of investigators.  If the Minister of State does not feel minded to go the full way, my suggestion would restore public confidence in the process, which would be important.Deputy Shatter has discussed a number of the outstanding issues in the difficult matter of protecting children to the extent demanded and required by the public and desired by every Deputy.  He rightly mentioned the comprehensive and nationally uniform application of the child protection guidelines.  We must all ensure that it becomes the case.Deputy Shatter and the Minister of State discussed the constitutional amendment on children.  None of these matters is simple.  I will be honest, as I have heard compelling cases for a rebalancing of the Constitution and for the current balance being better than an alternative.  After rereading the 1993 record of the House, I am minded to support the constitutional amendment, but we will have a job to do to get it passed.  People in the House will say that they are in favour of it.  When push comes to shove, however, and they are told that they will be dismantling the family, there might not be many people knocking on doors to press the issue when it comes to be determined.  However, it is right that we should try to shape and advance the constitutional amendment.While there are good arguments for and against mandatory reporting, I am minded to support it.  Deputy Shatter was clearer on this view at an earlier date than I.  On balance, it is the right thing to do.  The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children is working hard.  We produced an interim report on soft information.  It is a source of regret that the Government has not acted more speedily to introduce legislation to deal with that issue.  It is an issue which we regarded as of such urgency, we extracted it from the body of other important work and asked the Government to legislate quickly.The following is a point on which I have strong views.  This House is a debating Chamber and we often take sides on issues.  There are no sides on this issue.  As one in this House, we have a simple and clear objective, namely, to protect children as best we can, to put in place as many supports as we can in that regard and to find the resources to do so.  There are no political differences on this issue rather, it is a basic and fundamental task we share.This is an issue on which, uniquely, we can work together.  When I say it is an issue on which we can all work together, that is not to suggest we will all reach the same conclusions; we will not.  Simple issues to which people put forward simplistic solutions are often not simple.  I have said in private in committee and say publicly now that I have changed my view on many of the fundamental issues.  We need clear and public debate on this issue, a respect for each other's views on it and  a determination to work quickly in that regard.Nobody has a monopoly of wisdom on this issue.  I recall the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform pushing through without adequate debate the 2006 Act, aspects of which I argued trenchantly against.  Unfortunately, I have been proven right.  There are a number of critical issues in respect of child protection which we need to address and to get right.  I believe that the net issue on which we can pull together, in respect of the awful tragedy in Roscommon, is the establishment of an inquiry system in which the public can have confidence.  I ask the Minister to reflect carefully on what has been said in this House so that there is no division about this process, the objective of which we are all agreed upon.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I thank Deputy Howlin for sharing time.A wave of revulsion swept across the nation as the details of the Roscommon child abuse case emerged during the course of last week.  This case of appalling abuse, while shocking, is a symptom of the thoroughly defective system of child protection in operation across this State.  Each year, approximately 2,500 cases of suspected child abuse are reported to the social services.  We have no system of mandatory reporting so this figure may only be scratching the surface.  The 2002 Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, report states that — I must emphasise this — more than a quarter of men and women had experienced some level of childhood sexual abuse.The unimaginable suffering inflicted upon the children in Roscommon highlights the urgent need to strengthen children's rights and to greatly improve resources to protect vulnerable children.  Sinn Féin has consistently and repeatedly called for the rights of children to be enshrined in the Constitution and to be protected fully in legislation.  For the past number of days members of the public have queried how it could be possible that a person could abuse their family in this manner and receive only seven years in prison.  The answer is simply that this happened because the abuser was prosecuted under archaic legislation owing to the ineptitude of a Government that until 2006 had failed to implement a law providing lengthier sentences for the offences committed in this case.However, constitutional and legislative changes alone will not guarantee the safety of all children in all circumstances.  We need child protection to be robust enough to prevent and punish sexual abuse.  We, as a society, have a shared and collective responsibility to exercise vigilance and a willingness to speak up if we have cause for concern within our communities.  Also, we need urgent measures to enhance the social services for vulnerable children.The issues highlighted by the Roscommon case are not new.  Last May, an RTE "Prime Time Investigates" programme revealed the horrific extent of the child protection crisis in this State.  Children are being abused and neglected or left at risk of abuse and neglect even though their files are in the hands of the HSE and they are known to be in grave danger.  That situation cannot be allowed to continue.Increased resources, training and other measures are needed immediately to ensure that sexual assaults and child sexual abuse are thoroughly and sensitively investigated and prosecuted.  Victims-survivors need to receive the necessary support to proceed with and complete a prosecution.  A new, robust and specific law prohibiting child sexual abuse is needed in the context of a complete review and overhaul of sexual offences legislation and full enshrinement of children's rights.There are suggestions by those in the treatment sector that the number of people in the State with harmful sexual behaviour is far above the 3,000 mark.  Yet, despite this distressing figure, there are monumental gaps in a health service which is failing on every level to protect children and families, assess suspected abusers and treat offenders.  There is no one system of assessing an allegation of abuse or potential for a person to re-offend and there is no standard method of treatment or rehabilitation for those who abuse.  Where there is what appears to be a decent system in the first instance, we find it is wholly under-funded.  Social workers are overloaded with cases and have no uniform method of tracking a person's risk of offending or, equally, of tracking any risk that a person will be abused.  The Children Act 2001 gives health boards powers to intervene where there is suspected abuse and to provide support services but this Act has not yet been fully implemented.  These may be some of the reasons it took social services eight years to take the children of the Roscommon abuse case into care.A constitutional referendum on the position of children within our society will only partially solve the problem.  Fully resourcing a system where cases of abuse are dealt with on an ad hoc emergency basis will only partially solve the problem.  It is clear now that a massive overhaul is needed across the board.  Constitutional guarantees to protect children are mere lip-service unless authorities are resourced to prevent and combat neglect and abuse.The Roscommon child abuse case is a tragic example of a failed system based on dealing with the aftermath of abuse rather than preventing it.  This is not a time for mere hand-wringing, it is a time for making changes to a child protection structure that does not work.  The history of child protection in this State is marked by inquiry after inquiry.  National outrage ensued after the Kilkenny incest case, the death of Kelly Fitzgerald and the case of Sophia McColgan.  Yet, the Government has failed to learn any lessons from these instances where the State abjectly failed in its duties to protect those who were vulnerable.Are we now to see a further inquiry that will produce a report that will gather dust on a shelf for years while its recommendations are ignored?  Must we again be witness to another shocking case of child abuse, such as that of the Roscommon children, when yet another inquiry will be demanded and the whole performance enacted again?  What exactly will it take for change to occur in how we protect our children?  While I welcome and support this motion in the name of the Fine Gael Deputies, it must be said that inquiries are worth nothing if their results are not acted upon.  However, I wish to record my welcome of the willingness of Norah Gibbons of Barnardo's to participate in an inquiry into the Roscommon case and to express confidence that she will exercise her energies and skills, and those of her organisation, to ensure that action does indeed follow on her participation in and production of a report and recommendations regarding this tragic case.Until radical changes are made to the child protection system Government inaction, under-funding and under-resourcing will amount to complicity in making the lives of some of the most abused and vulnerable children in society all the more perilous.  We must accept that there are many other children at risk of the same abuse and neglect as the Roscommon children, some of whom at least are known to the health services.  My Sinn Féin colleagues and I implore the Government to make the requisite changes so that more children do not have to suffer such degradation and what must be a deep inner pain.

It has just come to my attention that there is a proposal before the Health Service Executive to reform the HSE regions for administrative purposes.  Apparently all the regions will be restored to their former status, with the exception of the north west.  I request further information on this proposal.  Specifically, I want to know why it is proposed that the north west should be the only region not to be re-established.The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, said she planned to achieve more effective changes in the organisational structure of the HSE, and I agree fully with her on this.  I am a former member of the North-Western Health Board and have first-hand knowledge of the inner workings of the regionalised system.  The North-Western Health Board area was, I believe, one of the most effective in the country.  Staff there were dedicated, efficient and conscientious, with a genuine concern for those using the services.  I agree that there are major benefits to be gained from regionalising the areas for administrative purposes.  It will ensure more accountability and speed up many of the processes.  Local staff have the benefit of knowledge of the area they work in and this can mean better and more efficient results for the public, which is what we are all trying to achieve across the health system.Why, then, is the north-west area being denied this change?  Why is it proposed that it be the only area not to be reinstated?  Why has there been no consultation with Oireachtas Members or, at the very least, information provided to them regarding this plan?  In my constituency, Sligo-North Leitrim, there is a state of the art facility in Manorhamilton, just a few miles from Sligo.  There is no shortage of skilled workers in the area.  A top class management structure has in place in the north west for a long time.A meeting was held recently between Oireachtas Members from Sligo, Leitrim and east Mayo with consultants and other doctors at Sligo General Hospital in relation to cancer services.  We were requested to organise a meeting with the Minister and Professor Keane.  I am glad to say that the meeting will take place on Thursday.  I hope everybody will go into that meeting with an open mind to try to resolve, once and for all, a difficult situation in the Sligo and north-west region.  All we want, ultimately, are the best treatments and outcomes for our people.Following the meeting with the consultants, who gave Oireachtas Members a very comprehensive briefing, it emerged that there were nearly 7,000 outpatient clinic appoints at Sligo General Hospital in 2008.  I implore everybody to go in with a very open mind and, hopefully, we shall have a resolution to what is a very difficult situation.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I will be taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Deputy Scanlon for raising this issue.  I am glad of the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to counter, yet again, the idea that the Health Service Executive, or the Government, is planning to restore the former health boards.The Minister for Health and Children confirmed to the House last July that there are management changes under way at the HSE.  As part of these changes the HSE has informed the Government that it is proposing to put in place a regional administrative structure, within the national structure, to drive operational performance and accountability on the ground.  The HSE has not yet finalised its proposals for these changes.  There will not be any regional authorities or any other autonomous structures within the HSE.  No change will  be needed to the Health Act 2004 to give effect to these management changes.  There will continue to be one unified health service organisation.  The full, formal accountability arrangements set up in that Act do not change.  The HSE will continue to pursue the benefits of service integration, for example, between acute and primary care, and implementing consistent national service standards.The Minister has made it clear on many occasions that she wants to see health and personal care provided to patients on an integrated basis.  There must be accountability throughout the system, at all levels, to deliver on national policies and standards.  This can only happen if authority and accountability for operational performance is delegated to regional and local level in a meaningful way.  That is what the HSE is proposing to do.  It is a natural evolution of the health reform process.  The 2001 health strategy highlighted the need to strengthen existing delivery structures at local level within a framework of national standards for the whole health system.  One of the objectives of the reform programme approved by the Government in 2003 was to provide clear lines of accountability and to simplify the structures.The Fitzgerald report into the events in Portlaoise identified systemic weaknesses of governance, management and communication within the HSE.  It noted that key people in the process were distracted by other important issues they had to attend to during the period.  Those assigned to focus on operations within a region must be enabled to do so.  When the Minister wrote to the chairman of the HSE, on foot of this report, she asked him to consider whether the governance and management issues which had been identified in relation to the events at Portlaoise had wider application across the HSE.  The Minister acknowledged that the board had already been considering these issues and asked for this work to be expedited.Following further work within the HSE and in ongoing contact with the Department, the HSE is developing a package of proposals to change the organisation.  These changes are designed to enable a single national strategic approach with local regional responsibility for service delivery; to ensure clinical leadership and engagement at all levels; to create a leaner organisation with clarity of roles and accountability; and to provide integrated service delivery for the benefit of patients and optimise efficient use of resources.  In summary, the changes involve the integration of the two service delivery pillars, NHO and PCCC, under a single national director of operations who will be responsible for all service delivery with a team of regional operations managers; the integration of the HSE's planning capabilities under a new national director of planning  and performance, with a  team of national care group-programme managers covering areas such as children, older people, disability-mental health, acute hospitals and primary-community care who would be responsible for setting corporate policy-standards in all these areas and driving performance against these standards; the creation of a clinical care and quality directorate which would drive clinical governance, quality and  risk, national standards and protocols and provide clinical leadership within the healthcare system; and the creation of a communications directorate responsible for all communications, including parliamentary affairs.Some of these changes are already under way.  The recruitment process for the director of operations, the director of planning and performance and the director of clinical care and quality has begun.  The new director of communications has been appointed.  The administrative regional structure is not finalised and has not been agreed yet.  It will not involve re-establishing local autonomous structures.The regional level changes proposed by the HSE will be considered by the Government when they are finalised and submitted to the Minister by the board of the executive.  The Government will want to be satisfied that the proposed changes will improve operational performance and accountability, and that they will sit comfortably with the configuration of other public services at local level.

This is a matter of grave importance to Limerick city and county overall.  The fact that I, as a Deputy for Limerick city, am obliged to raise this matter in the Dáil, three weeks after Dell announced it was to close its manufacturing facility, with the loss of 1,900 jobs, is an absolute disgrace.  The fact is that I am forced to do it as the Tánaiste came to Limerick only on 13 January, nearly a week after the Dell announcement was made.Almost three weeks after the closure was announced, we still have no indication as to when the multi-agency task force will be put in place, or its configuration.  One begins to believe the Government wants the Dell issue and the issue of unemployment in Limerick — with companies such as Banta which are directly linked to Dell — to slip off the pages of the national media, in the hope that it will disappear.  It will not, because the local media have kept this top of the agenda.  As a public representative, I will continue to keep it top of the agenda.  This task force should have been set up long before these jobs went.  I called on 4 November for such a task force to be established because there was large-scale unemployment in Limerick and a continuing overhang as regards the Dell manufacturing jobs.  I wanted a proactive measure, but what one gets from this Government is not even reactive — it is crisis management, pure inertia.  Here we find the people of Limerick are suffering.  Some 450 of the 1,900 people working in Dell are due to lose their jobs at the end of April.  Banta, a plant related to Dell where more than 700 people work, will shed jobs on a pro rata basis, likewise Kostal in west Limerick.  What is this Government doing?  What is the delay with this task force?  Why has it not been announced?  Why was it not in place to provide a contingency plan before these jobs went?  I cannot understand why that was the case, unless due to bad management and a lack of understanding of how serious is this situation.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, was in the House earlier today.  I mentioned that I would raise this on the Adjournment tonight and I expected her to be here because that is her job.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, but this is of such magnitude in Limerick that it warrants direct ministerial intervention.  I want to hear this task force announced tonight.  I want to hear what it consists of, that it is a multi-agency task force including business interests.  We want action.  The time for talking is long over.

Since the recess we had some devastating job losses in county Limerick, 1,900 Dell workers, 200 in Kostal, Abbeyfeale and 100 in Kostal, Mallow.  The positives should be pointed out.  Dell will keep 2,000 high-end jobs, which is very welcome.  We are not losing Dell but some of the manufacturing jobs there.  That is regrettable and a terrible blow to those who held those jobs.  Kostal has been an exemplary employer and has kept its staff informed for the last number of weeks.  In previous situations when it has asked for voluntary redundancies it has looked after its staff very well and I hope that follows through this situation.  I hope Dell can do likewise and look after and compensate its workers who have been loyal to it for many years.The Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, visited Limerick at her earliest opportunity.  She was asked to give some space to the workers and their employers, and that happened.  It was announced on Thursday morning and she was in Limerick on the following Tuesday or Wednesday.  She met the workers, the public representatives in the area, the mayors of the city and county and gave them a very full briefing.

I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, who is attached to the office of the line Minister, is here tonight to listen to our concerns.  He, too, has been more than helpful in this situation through his responsibility for FÁS and other agencies and I appeal to the Government to ensure we have the fullest support for those people.  I further appeal to the Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher and the Government on job replacement.I have mentioned this on a few occasions recently.  A business park was opened in Askeaton 20 years ago when the State agreed to buy 200 acres of land.  Not one sod was turned on that business park and not one job was created.  With respect to Limerick city and my colleague's constituency, they have had the benefit of many thousands of job announcements over a number of years because multinationals tend to go to the urban centres.  We have an ideal opportunity for the Newcastle-Wests, Kilmallocks and Askeatons of County Limerick to take up the slack and create employment there.  I have the fullest confidence.  The Tánaiste has identified the proper person to head up the task force and personnel to take part in it.  She will be totally committed to ensuring we can replace many of the jobs lost in county Limerick.

He has a very strong concern about the impact of the job losses in Dell on Limerick and the mid-west region and the further spiral of job losses this will create.  We all accept that.  We are all practising politicians in this House and we on this side of the House are fully aware of the concerns of public representatives and, more important, the devastation job losses can cause to the employees, families and the broader community.  Any practising politician would be well aware of this because no constituency is immune to potential job losses, or they have happened in previous times.  We are well aware of the concerns out there.The Government wants to keep this on the agenda because we must acknowledge a number of very important points to which Deputy Cregan alluded.  Dell is still in Limerick.  It is a very good employer and we want to ensure the contribution Dell has made to the mid-west region for many years since it came——

As I said, I am keenly aware of the impact that will have on the employees and the broader mid-west region.  We had established a group of the relevant State agencies to prepare for a major job loss situation to specifically deal with the needs of any workers to be made redundant.  The group, chaired by my Department, has been working to take the appropriate actions to support those to be made redundant to find new employment, including assistance to reskill and retrain to enhance their future employment potential.Immediately following the Dell announcement, this group met with Dell on 9 January and established appropriate contacts as to who will work with the company.  Since then, FÁS has had a number of meetings with Dell and will commence meeting Dell staff next week on 2 February.  In preparation for job losses at Dell, FÁS mid-west had put in place a team to deal specifically with redundancies in Dell and other companies in the region.  As an initial step, at a meeting held on its premises on 12 January last, four days after the announcement of the redundancies, the team offered Dell employees group briefing sessions to outline the range of FÁS services available to them.

In addition FÁS will host training and job opportunities events in Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary.  These events will have local, national and European vacancies on display as well as employers in attendance.FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and the City and County Enterprise Boards, University of Limerick and Limerick Institute of Technology have developed a web portal to assist people who find themselves out of work in the mid-west.  This web portal will guide people through the initial orientation process into new opportunities.  Through this co-ordinated approach, the affiliated organisations are ensuring that valuable time is not lost and people will get clear and comprehensive individual guidance.  The web portal will provide information and direct access to designated contact people within the organisations.In the mid-west area, IDA Ireland has been working diligently to secure new investments, and over the past year companies like Vistakon, Zimmer, Cook, DTS and Microsemi have announced jobs in the region.  The agency has a pipeline of projects under consideration.  These potential investments are being pursued and IDA will do everything possible to speed up the investment decisions in Limerick's favour.IDA Ireland's regional strategy reflects the NSS, with an emphasis on the Limerick-Shannon gateway and on the hub town of Ennis.  IDA Ireland's strategy for the mid-west region and Limerick is and will continue to be — transition to a knowledge economy by winning new foreign direct investment, FDI, in innovation driven, high value, high skills sectors; to work with the existing company base to expand their presence by increasing the number and scale of functions being carried out and by adding further strategic functions; to promote balanced regional development; to influence the provision of modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure; and to work with local authorities and other partners to influence the creation of the right infrastructural environment to help win new FDI throughout the region.

For the past ten years there has been a campaign running to replace the school.  It caters for 432 pupils but was built to cater for 350 pupils.  The original school building was 20,400 sq. ft., which was one sixth less than the standard required at that time.  According to the engineer's report:The school currently has problems relating to space, classrooms, circulation, the lack of social and dining areas for pupils, health and safety issues and staff accommodation, both social and professional.  The school needs to be evaluated not only from the perspective of the physical structure, but also from the perspective of its educational adequacy.It caters for a large area north west of Clifden, including Clifden, Cleggan, Claddaduff, Renville and almost as far as Leenane, and, to the west, Ballyconnelly, Roundstone, Tomboola, Cashel and Recess, which is on the east side of the school.  That is a catchment area of approximately 22 square miles.  An added problem facing the school is that the only other second level school in that area, Kylemore Abbey, is being phased out.  It now caters only for fifth and sixth year students and will be closed in two years' time.  This will increase the number of pupils attending the Clifden school.I have followed this campaign closely for the past ten years.  I have tabled several parliamentary questions, first on 28 February 2001 asking the then Minister for Education and Science "whether it would be better value for money to build a new school at an extra cost of £1.4 million and maintain the old building for other uses in the community".  The then Minister, Deputy Michael Woods, told me he was looking into it.  On 21 March 2006, the then Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, said: "The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning."  On 29 April 2008, she said: "My Department recently approved the stage 3 submission for this project."There are frequent public meetings in Clifden about the school and we get great value out of it.  We held a public meeting before the 2002 election attended by the Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, and Deputy Frank Fahey, who were then Ministers of State and have many connections with that area.  I thought I would be canvassing the workers on the site before the election.  We had a tremendous meeting before the 2007 election too, attended by 250 or 300 parents, in the school and I thought I would be knocked with bulldozers which we were told would move in straightaway.Two years into the life of this Government, however, the building of the school seems to be as far away as ever.  What is the situation about the provision for the school?  Now is the hour for the Minister to act.  Construction firms and workers are out of work.  Now is the time to give people in an area of high unemployment, Clifden and north Connemara, an opportunity to work.  Those people would far rather work than be on the dole.  If the Government moved to sanction the building of this necessary second level school in Clifden, it would be opportune for everybody, parents, pupils, teachers and the construction industry workers around Clifden who would be glad to have jobs.I hope I will not have to speak on the subject here again.  I look forward to being at a meeting before the next election, which might come sooner than we think, and hope to get the bulldozers will be revved up.  I hope I will not have to return to the next Dáil to ask that this school building be started.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I am responding to the Deputy on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I wish to thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of improved facilities for Clifden community school, County Galway.All applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exist, but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision of desirable, but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.  The proposed extension and refurbishment of Clifden community school has been assigned a band rating of 2.3.The proposed extension and refurbishment project for Clifden community school is based on a long-term projected enrolment of 425 pupils.  The current enrolment is 401 pupils, 383 mainstream pupils and 18 PLC pupils.  The area of the proposed new accommodation amounts to 1,676 sq. m and includes general classrooms, two science laboratories, woodwork and construction studies room, technical graphics room, general purpose and dining area and other ancillary accommodation.  It also includes some refurbishment work to the existing accommodation, the toilets area, metalwork room, home economics room and art and craft room.The school authorities were informed on 11 January 2008 that the stage three, detailed design, for the project was approved but the project was not authorised to progress further at that time.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  This project will be considered on an on-going basis in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and point out that over the lifetime of the national development plan, NDP, the Government is providing funding of €4.5 billion for school buildings.  This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and it will enable the Department to ensure that school places are available where they are needed.  This investment will allow the Department to continue the school building programme which commenced during the life time of the last NDP when well over €2.6 billion was invested in school development delivering, as it did, over 7,800 projects.The allocation for school buildings in 2009 is €581 million.  This represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of the Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.The Minister for Education and Science is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Clifden community school at the earliest possible date.  However, in light of current economic circumstances, and with competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible for the Minister to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of this project at this time.  I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am very disappointed that I am here again tonight.  I have raised the issue of this particular school on many occasions.  The school is in existence for ten years.  It has 11 permanent staff and 200 pupils, with a waiting list to get into the school.Before the general election in 2007, the school management was led to believe by the former Minister for Education and Science that a new school would be sanctioned, the sod would be turned before Christmas, and that the pupils would be in that school for 2008.  A few years ago, before the local elections, the then Minister, Deputy Michael Woods, visited the local schools.  He sang an Abba song at one school called "Money, Money, Money", but he did not come up with the money at the time, and he let down the school at Westport Quay.  He led us to believe that Gaelscoil na Cruaiche in Westport would be the priority.  When will the funding be sanctioned for that school?  When are the parents going to know that their children are going to be taught in a new school?  It is not fair on the teachers, it is not fair on the pupils and it is not fair on the school.  We are paying more money on prefabs and this is costing a fortune.There has been much talk recently about the school bond scheme, where somebody with the resources can do a deal with the Government to build these schools.  If the Government has not got the funding, it should get a builder to build the school and it can then buy it back from him.  What is happening is not right.  Before the last general election, Fianna Fáil led everybody to believe that the school would be up and running this year.  It is not right to have teachers working or pupils educated in these conditions.When can we expect an announcement regarding the new school?  When can we expect the funding to be put in place?  When can we see the bulldozers?  There had been difficulties with the site but planning permission has been secured and everything is in place.  What is needed now is approval from the Department.  It is not fair to mislead the public.  People were expecting the construction of the school to start last year and to be in the school this year.  What is the up to date position?  Is there any hope that the school will start this year?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I am responding to the Deputy on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.  I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the position of the Department on the provision of a new school building for Gaelscoil na Cruaiche in Westport, County Mayo.  Improving facilities in the existing building stock, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge which the Minister for Education and Science has identified as one of his top priorities.Gaelscoil Na Cruaiche is a co-educational Gaelscoil serving the town of Westport and its environs.  The school opened in September 1996 with provisional recognition and was granted permanent recognition in 2000.  The school is currently located in temporary accommodation which is funded by the Department.  The school is staffed by a principal, eight mainstream assistants, one learning support teacher and one resource teacher, and has an enrolment of over 200 pupils in the current academic year.The brief for this project entails the construction of a new ten classroom primary school.  The project for the proposed new school has been progressed by the Department and is now at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  A site has been secured and planning permission for the proposed new school has been obtained.  However, it is not possible to progress all projects to construction at the same time.  The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  The further progression of this project will continue to be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.The allocation for school buildings in 2009 is €581 million.  This represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of the Government to investing in school infrastructure.  Under the lifetime of the current national development plan, almost €4.5 billion will be invested in school buildings.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools. This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large scale refurbishments.  It builds on the delivery of 7,800 building projects under the last national development plan which resulted in the delivery of new schools and the refurbishment of many existing schools.I assure the Deputy that the Minister for Education and Science is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Gaelscoil na Cruaiche at the earliest possible date.  However, in light of current economic circumstances, and with competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 110, 113, 115 to 119, inclusive, 128, 129, 146, 151, 152, 159, 748, 754 and 757 together.I refer Deputies to my earlier reply to Priority Question numbers 100 and 102.  Ireland and its EU partners have worked closely with others in the international community to promote a peaceful resolution of the Gaza crisis. The parameters for such a peaceful resolution were clearly set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1860 adopted on 8 January whose four operative elements called for: a halt in rockets launched into Israel; an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza; a reopening of the crossings into Gaza; and development of a mechanism to prevent arms smuggling into Gaza. The resolution was adopted with the support of fourteen members of the Security Council. The United States explained that it abstained because, although it did not disagree with the substance of the text, it had first wished to await the outcome of the Egyptian peace efforts.The EU was not slow to respond to the crisis in Gaza. As well as visits to the region, there were the extraordinary meeting of Foreign Ministers in Paris on 30 December which I attended, along with yesterday's substantive discussion at the General Affairs and External Relations Council. There have also been meetings with the Foreign Ministers of Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. For my part, I and my officials maintained close contact with the Israeli and Egyptian Embassies and the General Delegation of Palestine throughout the recent crisis. I met with the Israeli Ambassador, the Delegate General of Palestine, and with the visiting Israeli Minister of Education to convey our concerns and hear their viewpoints.While there was an initial increase in the flow of humanitarian aid passing into Gaza after the unilateral Israeli ceasefire of 18 January, it is clear, and there was consensus on this issue at yesterday's Council meeting, that the volume of such aid remains inadequate and it is imperative that Israel do everything possible to facilitate the relief and rehabilitation operation being undertaken by UN organisations and international and local aid agencies.  Looking further ahead, Israel must move to end its economic blockade and reopen permanently these crossings into Gaza. The EU stands ready to reactivate its border monitoring mission at the Rafah crossing point and has discussed extending this mission to facilitate the reopening of Gaza. More broadly, as the largest trading partner of Israel, and the largest aid donor to the Palestinian people, the EU must exercise its influence and assume a more prominent role in Middle East peace efforts.It is also clear that concerted international efforts will be required to end the smuggling of arms and components of arms into Gaza. I am aware of offers of assistance by certain EU partners — including France, Germany and Britain — made in this regard to Egypt and Israel, while the US and Israel have also concluded a bilateral memorandum of understanding on this issue. Any assistance that can be offered by the EU or by individual member states in combating the smuggling of arms into Gaza, and thus reducing the capacity of Hamas and other Palestinian factions to fire rockets into southern Israel, is to be strongly encouraged. It remains evident that any successful efforts to combat smuggling and to close tunnels into southern Gaza will ultimately depend and be facilitated by the permanent opening of border crossings.Understandable anger and frustration with Israel's disproportionate military action in Gaza has led to calls for the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement (or Association Agreement) of 2000 between the EU and Israel to be suspended. I have stated to EU colleagues, in a letter addressed to Czech Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg as current President of the Council, that what happened in Gaza means that it cannot be a "business as usual" approach with regard to proceeding with an upgrade of EU relations with Israel at this time.  At the same time, the Government has consistently been opposed to proposals for trade, diplomatic, cultural, academic, sporting or other boycotts of Israel. Calls for an EU trade boycott, the suspension of the existing Association Agreement or imposition of an arms embargo are not practicable as they would not have any prospect of attracting the necessary consensus amongst member states. As for discontinuing the purchase of Israeli hardware or services for our Defence Forces, this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence. I understand that effectiveness and value for money are key factors in deciding on tendering for equipment.At this moment, with the momentum for peace that may be generated by the new American administration, we need to encourage and support Israeli and Palestinian political leaders to take the hard decisions necessary in the negotiation of a settlement based on a two-State solution.

In March 2003, Timor-Leste was designated Ireland's first Programme Country in Asia, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  Since 2005, through the Government's aid programme, Irish Aid, we have provided total funding of €25.1 million for Timor Leste. This includes funding agreed under the Irish Aid programme budget, emergency and humanitarian relief, support for civil society and assistance for conflict resolution initiatives.Irish Aid is an important international donor to Timor Leste, working in partnership with the Government of the country, and cooperating with the other major international donors. These include Australia, Portugal, Japan, the United States, the European Union, Norway, Germany and New Zealand.  Seven years since Timor Leste achieved independence, following years of conflict, it remains the least developed country in Asia, with a young population, high unemployment, poor infrastructure and a largely subsistence economy. We are committed to continuing our support for the government and people of Timor Leste in reducing overall poverty levels and making real progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.Ireland's assistance to date has focused on supporting the new institutions of government, strengthening democracy, promoting human rights and the justice sector and strengthening civil society. We have also been working closely in support of those in Government and civil society who are addressing the difficult legacy of conflict across the country. This work is being led by the Conflict Resolution Unit established in my Department, with a particularly important contribution by Nuala O'Loan, whom the Government appointed as Special Envoy to Timor Leste in February last year.

These three thematic areas are:increasing smallholder agricultural productivity in Africa;targeting maternal and infant under-nutrition; andglobal leadership actions to tackling hunger, including making hunger a priority, particularly by ensuring that donor and recipient governments fulfil their commitments to its eradication.I welcome this focused approach and agree with the HTF that progress in these three areas will have a real impact.I am happy to report that we are already implementing key recommendations of the HTF Report. We are supporting, and will continue to support, smallholder and women farmers to intensify their agricultural productivity and produce more food. We are funding pro-poor agricultural research which helps farmers to increase productivity and become food sufficient. We are supporting nutritional interventions, especially those which target infant and maternal malnutrition. We are funding Non Governmental Organisations working with farmers to increase their productivity.In line with a key recommendation of the Hunger Task Force, a Special Envoy for Hunger was appointed last week. Mr Kevin Farrell, formerly of the World Food Programme, will work closely with my team in the Department and Irish Aid to bring the Hunger Task Force Report forward. His enormous experience in dealing with hunger in some of the most difficult operating environments such as Zimbabwe will be a real asset in advising on our efforts to reduce global hunger and food insecurity.We are currently allocating significant resources to the fight against global hunger by supporting programmes or projects which are directly or indirectly related to hunger reduction. In addition, some reorientation of the aid programme is expected in the years ahead as we focus even more on hunger reduction across the programme and as we appraise new programmes through a "hunger lens". We will of course ensure that our hunger actions are well co-ordinated with other pressing matters such as HIV/AIDS, education and good governance.

Serious fighting broke out in the east of the country in August 2008 between ethnic Tutsi militias and the armed forces of DRC, forcing 250,000 people to flee their homes. This renewed fighting has had a grave humanitarian impact, bringing to over 1 million the number displaced in the North Kivu province. I am particularly shocked by the attacks by all sides — including units of the DRC armed forces — on the civilian population of the region, and by the disturbing level of sexual and gender based violence which has accompanied the conflict.The situation in the provinces of North and South Kivu is now relatively calm, although it remains extremely tense, and it is too early to say what impact the ongoing Rwanda-DRC joint military operations there will have. I strongly urge all parties to do their utmost to protect the civilian population in the course of these actions. The work of the UN and humanitarian agencies in the region must be allowed to continue without interference. I am concerned by recent reports that the work of the UN has been impeded in the area of this latest military operation.Ireland and its EU partners strongly support MONUC, the UN peacekeeping force in DRC, and we have welcomed the unanimous adoption by the UN Security Council on 20 November last of a resolution which authorised the reinforcement of MONUC to allow it to better protect the civilian population in the region. Ireland contributes three members of the Defence Forces to MONUC as Military Liaison Officers.  I also welcome the adoption on 22 December 2008 of UN Security Council Resolutions 1856 and 1857, which extended the mandate of MONUC until 31 December 2009, and extended the sanctions regime in DRC. The issue of the deployment of a multi-national force in the region for an interim period to complement the work of MONUC is the subject of ongoing debate at the UN. The EU is closely monitoring the current discussions at the Security Council aimed at increasing the effectiveness of MONUC. With a longer term perspective, the EU has two ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) missions in DRC, which provide assistance to the DRC authorities on security sector reform and police reform.Only a political solution to the current conflict can provide the basis for durable peace in the region, and the international community has engaged in concerted efforts to this end. The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has appointed the former Nigerian President, Mr. Olesegun Obasanjo, as his Special Envoy to the region to lead efforts to pursue a negotiated settlement. Talks have been convened in Nairobi between DRC government representatives and representatives of the ethnic Tutsi CNDP rebel group. Although some progress has been made in these talks, it remains to be seen what impact the arrest of CNDP leader Laurent Nkunda will have.Fears of a further humanitarian crisis in the region arise from the continuing activities of the Ugandan rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), in north-eastern DRC. As they have fled from a joint operation involving the governments of Uganda, DRC and Southern Sudan, LRA forces have engaged in brutal attacks on the civilian population. I am gravely concerned by reports of abductions, rape, torture, looting and the destruction of property in the region, with an estimated 900 people having been killed as a result of this latest violence, and 130,000 displaced.  Ireland has been able to respond rapidly to the humanitarian dimension of the crisis in DRC. An airlift of emergency relief supplies to eastern DRC was made in December. In 2008, a total of over €11 million in humanitarian aid funding was provided for DRC, bringing our total support to the country since 2006 to over €31 million.

According to the National Emergency Commission, the earthquake claimed the lives of at least 15 people, with more still missing. Approximately 3,700 people were accommodated in temporary shelters. The earthquake also caused damage to infrastructure, affecting highways, bridges and housing, as well as energy production and distribution facilities. The emergency response to the earthquake has been effectively managed by the National Emergency Commission of Costa Rica, which activated local committees to coordinate relief efforts.The International Federation of the Red Cross has provided support of over €36,000 to the Costa Rican Red Cross from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF). Ireland is the fourth largest donor to the DREF, a pool of un-earmarked funding available for immediate support to Red Cross / Red Crescent Societies in response to unforeseen emergencies. Pre-positioning funding in this manner is an effective means of ensuring that support can be channelled rapidly and effectively to those most in need following disasters such as the Costa Rica earthquake.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 133 together.Iran recommenced uranium enrichment and centrifuge research in January 2006. Since that date the international community, led on this critical issue by the ‘E3+3' group (Germany, France and the UK, along with Russia, China, and the United States), have been trying to persuade Iran to suspend its enrichment activity as a necessary condition for full scale talks to reach a permanent solution to this issue. Since then there have been four UN Security Council Resolutions requiring the suspension of enrichment and imposing sanctions on Iran, targeted at its nuclear and military sectors.  Iran has in that period, at various levels, made various suggestions that it might be prepared to suspend or freeze some activities in return for the removal of restrictions in place on its nuclear sector. None of these suggestions on examination has amounted to an offer of full suspension of enrichment. On the contrary, Iran has repeatedly stated that it will in no circumstances agree to suspend enrichment, and that any solution can only be on this basis.In June 2008, on behalf of the EU3+3, High Representative Solana handed an improved ‘incentives package' to the Iranian authorities, proposing areas of possible co-operation if Iran abandons its programme of uranium enrichment. Iran tacitly rejected this package by responding with a counter-proposal which did not provide for the suspension of enrichment. Ireland fully supports the twin track approach of the EU3+3, which offers Iran positive engagement and co-operation if it changes course, but a concurrent enforcement track at the Security Council while it refuses to do so. I hope very much that Iran will at last agree to negotiate seriously on this issue. It is also hopeful that President Obama has long advocated an open approach to Iran to see if a real accommodation can be made.Article 4 of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) confirms States Parties' right to develop, research, production and use of nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes — within the obligations set out in Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty, which prohibit efforts to acquire or manufacture nuclear weapons. At the same time Article 3 of the NPT obligates Parties to act within the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This, and this alone, creates the stable international environment and confidence necessary to allow for the full realisation of Article 4.The Government would underline the importance for all countries to fully comply with all their obligations under the NPT. Full implementation of a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol remains the only acceptable standard by which compliance with these obligations can be assured.  I deeply regret Iran's decision not to implement its Additional Protocol with the IAEA. Equally, I am seriously concerned by Iran's failure to fully co-operate with the IAEA to address the serious issues raised by the Director General in successive reports. I am disturbed by the view expressed by the IAEA that some of Iran's actions are "not consistent with its obligations".It is Iran's own actions that have raised serious doubts internationally regarding the intent of its nuclear programme. I would urge Iran, therefore, to fully implement its safeguards agreements with the IAEA, including the Additional Protocol. It should co-operate fully with that Agency to address all outstanding issues and to clearly demonstrate the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, and should comply fully with Security Council Resolutions.

Bilaterally, and with our EU partners, we have consistently sought to impress on both the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) the importance of engaging in meaningful peace talks and stopping all violence and human rights violations. We deeply regret the termination of the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE last year. We continue to take the firm view that there can be no lasting military solution to Sri Lanka's political difficulties.As one of the four co-chairs of the 2003 Tokyo Conference on the Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka, the EU has been anxious to maintain an active role in assisting the country to resolve its internal conflicts, work on national reconciliation and move forward on the development agenda. Following a meeting of the Co-Chairs of the Conference on 24 September last, the Presidency expressed again its concern in relation to human rights and the plight of civilian populations isolated by combat in the north of the country. It called on the parties involved to respect the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and noted the obligation of the Sri Lankan Government to ensure protection of its civilians and to meet their needs.However, over past months the military offensive against the LTTE has greatly escalated and there appears to be no prospect of a ceasefire. The Government has succeeded in re-capturing most of the territory previously under LTTE control and is determined to press ahead. The LTTE also appears to be determined to maintain its campaign. The effects of both the Government's and the LTTE's military campaigns on the local population are extremely serious. It is particularly worrying that the Government no longer publishes details of civilian casualties.Also of major concern are the killings of, and attacks on, journalists and media figures critical of the Government, including the brutal murder of the respected journalist Mr Lesantha Wickramatunga on 8 January and the armed attack on the premises of the MTV television station. Although the President of Sri Lanka issued a strong statement condemning the murder of Mr Wickramatunga, no arrests have been made in connection with the killing nor indeed for any previous incident of intimidation against independent journalists.    The EU Presidency and the EU Heads of Mission in Colombo have called on the authorities in Sri Lanka to investigate all acts of violence and intimidation against the media and to bring the perpetrators to justice.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The regime governing the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf in international law is set down by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Under that Convention a coastal state is entitled to a continental shelf 200 nautical miles (approx. 370 km) in breadth regardless of whether its continental shelf physically extends that far, subject only to the similar rights of its coastal neighbours. It may also claim a broader shelf where it can show that the natural prolongation of its land territory under water actually extends beyond that limit. A claim to extended shelf must be supported by scientific and technical data and be established to the satisfaction of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was created by the Convention for this purpose.  Ireland's shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and the south of the country. For the purposes of our claims we have divided our shelf into three sectors.The first sector is to the south-west of the country on the edge of an area known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. This sector (which is approximately half the size of the State's land territory) is not disputed by any other state and was therefore the subject of Ireland's first submission to the Commission, made in May 2005. Based upon this submission, the Commission issued its recommendations on the limits of this claimed area in April 2007, allowing Ireland to designate an area of extended shelf of up to 39,000 square kilometres. The Government has accepted these recommendations and work is now in hand in the preparation of a Government Order to be made under the Continental Shelf Act 1968. That Order will designate the additional seabed enclosed by the recommended limits as an area to which the 1968 Act applies.The second sector of claimed extended continental shelf is in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay where there are unresolved boundary issues with the UK, France and Spain. This sector was the subject of a joint submission by the four countries in May 2006. It covers an area of approximately 80,000 square kilometres, which is slightly larger than the State's land territory. The joint submission was examined by a subcommission established to examine the evidence submitted in support of it. The four states met with the subcommission on a number of occasions, most recently in September. The meeting was positive and the subcommission has now formulated its draft recommendations. These recommendations have in turn been transmitted to the full Commission and will be considered by it for approval in March 2009. The question of division of the area between the four states concerned will now be considered after the recommendations have been made.Ireland also claims continental shelf in the part of the North-East Atlantic Ocean known as the Hatton-Rockall Area, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the coast. Ireland and the UK agreed a maritime boundary on the continental shelf here in 1988 but this is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Færoe Islands), which also make extensive overlapping claims. The four countries have met regularly since 2001 (most recently in London before Christmas) in an effort to resolve the issues arising from overlapping claims but to date have been unable to reach agreement. Nevertheless, the four are keeping the matter under regular review and, in the meantime, Ireland will proceed to make a national submission to the Commission in respect of the Hatton-Rockall Area by the deadline of May 2009.

I discussed this issue with my colleagues at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels yesterday, where I outlined my concerns that the conflict in Gaza would have the effect of undermining moderate Palestinian and Arab political opinion. More than ever, there is a pressing need to provide evidence to the Palestinian people that the political process works and can lead to an improvement in their daily lives. The Council recognised this in calling for an urgent and successful conclusion of the peace process.The focus now must therefore be on restoring momentum and credibility to the peace process. It is important to repeat the basic point that there can be no military solution to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. Only through peaceful negotiations can we achieve a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, with a two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at its core. The broad outline of such a settlement, as discussed at Camp David in 2000 and at Taba in 2001, and based in part on previous UN Security Council Resolutions, is well known.Beyond the obvious priority of securing a permanent ceasefire in Gaza through the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1860, there are a number of important steps that must be taken if the peace process is to be revived.  First, the Israeli Government must freeze all settlement construction on occupied land and remove general restrictions on movement. As I have stated many times, settlement construction anywhere in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under international law. It prejudges the outcome of final status negotiations and threatens the viability of an agreed two-State solution. I have recently conveyed my strong concerns about settlement construction directly to the Israeli Ambassador and the Israeli Minister for Education at meetings with them in Dublin in January, and also to Foreign Minister Livni during my visit to Israel last year.Secondly, there must a concerted attempt to achieve inter-Palestinian reconciliation. In the months before the Gaza crisis, Egypt, on behalf of the Arab League, had been making commendable efforts to advance reconciliation through the mediation of talks between Fatah and Hamas. Success in these discussions would be of great significance to the Palestinian people. Indeed, it is in the interests of all sides that an agreed national unity government — which supports the peace process and negotiations with Israel, leading to a two-State solution — be formed so that there can be one strong political voice for the Palestinian people. Precisely how such a government might formulate the principles underlying its approach would be for further consideration.Thirdly, the EU must step up its co-operation with its partners in the Quartet, and especially with President Obama and the new US Administration. I welcome the news that President Obama, on his first day of office, telephoned leaders in Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority to express his commitment and determination to engage actively with the peace process. His appointment of Senator George Mitchell — who we know so well from his role as chairman of the Good Friday Negotiations — as US Special Envoy to the Middle East is another indication of the importance the new US Administration is attaching to the resolution of the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. President Obama has the opportunity to bring unique leadership and impetus to the peace process and I am confident that renewed US engagement will be of great benefit to all parties.Finally, I believe that increased co-operation between the EU and the Palestinian Authority would bring an extra dimension to the peace process. With that in mind, at the December meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, my Cypriot colleague and I circulated a joint letter to all our EU partners with a view to exploring ways in which we might further enhance our relationship with the Palestinian Authority. I am particularly anxious to ensure the earliest and full implementation of the EU-PLO Interim Association Agreement, as well as the initiation of a more structured dialogue with the Palestinian Authority.As regards the proposed establishment of a Middle East Peace Process secretariat, the Government has for some time been among those Member States which have sought to strengthen the Quartet, and the EU's role within it. At the moment, various proposals have been made, including by French President Sarkozy, regarding future negotiating structures. Depending on developments, it may be that a proposal for the establishment of a permanent secretariat could be considered, in order to add focus to the work of the Quartet and the various international envoys active in the region.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 162 and 759 together.At the outset, I want to make clear our solidarity with our European partners, who have in some cases been extremely gravely affected by the energy shortages. Homes, businesses and public services have all suffered from the closing of gas supplies. It is absolutely unacceptable that this dispute should have been allowed to affect European consumers in this manner.  This has been discussed at meetings of European Foreign Ministers and Energy Ministers under the Czech Presidency. It is important to note that the dispute which cut off gas supplies to Europe was exclusively concerned with bilateral commercial arrangements between Ukraine and Russia. The EU and its Member States were not parties to this dispute.A meeting between Russia and the Ukraine was held in Moscow on 17 January to resolve the dispute. The Czech Presidency and the Commission attended the Moscow meeting on behalf of the EU Member States in order to convey to the parties a number of points which were agreed by the Union. These were:1. Gas to be restored immediately and unconditionally.2. This is a Russia Ukraine commercial dispute. Both sides must resolve this. The EU is not getting involved as regards who is to blame.3. There are clear serious commercial, financial, political and economic consequences for both sides.4. Both sides need to implement and fulfil the agreement reached with the EU on monitoring.I am pleased to confirm that gas flows to European markets resumed earlier this week. However, this cannot be the end of the matter.I discussed this issue with my colleagues at yesterday's meeting of the General Affairs Council. We agreed to work towards a comprehensive series of decisions on European energy security at the 2009 Spring European Council. Further decisions will be taken by the Energy Council at its meeting on 12 February 2009, with the focus on diversifying sources and routes of supply and improving infrastructure connections. Strengthening solidarity mechanisms and improving interconnection throughout Europe will also be critical to achieving more secure energy supplies for European consumers. Ireland will engage fully with its European partners in this vital debate.At national level, the Government is committed to delivering on its commitments with regard to renewable energy and energy efficiency. Implementation of the Sustainable Energy White Paper and the Energy Efficiency Action Plan will be critical in helping to reduce our dependency on imported fuels.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	470	Ireland has long had a strong commitment to participation in peace support operations. Ireland's policy with regard to peacekeeping is grounded in the UN Charter and in the primacy of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. Irish troops participate in UN-led, EU-led and NATO-led UN-mandated missions, and participation in peace support operations has become a core activity of the Irish Defence Forces.As the Deputy will be aware, there are currently 425 members of the Irish Defence Forces participating in the EU-led mission, EUFOR Tchad/RCA. EUFOR has made significant progress; however, it is clear that an international presence will continue to be required in the region for some time to come. A UN-led follow-on-force, MINURCAT II, is due to take over from EUFOR when its current mandate expires on 15 March 2009.In this context, my Department received a request from the United Nations on 10 October 2008, asking that the Government consider placing the troops currently in Chad with EUFOR under the command of the UN after 15 March 2009. The Government has approved, in principle, participation by the Defence Forces in MINURCAT II for a period of twelve months from 15 March 2009. Irish participation in MINURCAT II will, of course, be subject to the "Triple Lock" of UN mandate and Government and Dáil approval. When a final proposal for our deployment has been agreed with the UN, my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Mr. Willie O'Dea T.D., will revert to the Government and the Dáil.The United Nations Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) was established in 1999, and consists of 17,000 troops from 20 different countries. Since June 2001, three Irish Defence Forces officers have been deployed to this   mission as Military Liaison Officers. My Department received a request from the United Nations on 20 November 2008 asking the Government to contribute further troops to the mission. On 15 December the Department of Defence informed my Department that the Defence Forces were not in a position to contribute further personnel to the mission.  My Department also receives, on a regular basis, requests from the UN to provide individual officers to various peacekeeping missions. These requests are dealt with by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces on a case-by-case basis.

The Committee was launched in April 2007 with the objective of strengthening coherence in the Government's approach to development and making best use of the expertise and skills available across the public service. As the current Chair of the Committee, I am pleased that it has become the key forum for the sharing of knowledge and views on development issues across Government Departments. The Committee is working to ensure that a strong development perspective is integrated into Government decision-making in all relevant areas.The Inter-Departmental Committee has so far met seven times and has held discussions on seven major presentations. These have covered the report and recommendations of the Government's Hunger Task Force; the impact of climate change on development; the views of Non-Governmental Organisations on improving policy coherence for development; Ireland's engagement with the Bretton Woods Institutions; and the Dutch experience in developing a more integrated approach to development issues. The Committee has also received two presentations from the Institute for International Integration Studies at Trinity College Dublin on its Framework Research Project on policy coherence for development.At each meeting, the Committee has received reports on developments at EU level and on the ongoing work on policy coherence for development within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Two Sub-Groups have been established, and report regularly to the Committee. The Sub-Group on Multilateral Organisations focuses on the development of a coherent inter-Departmental policy approach for Ireland's participation in international meetings on development, particularly at the United Nations. The Sub-Group on Skills Sets is examining how to make best use across Ireland's development programme of the range of skills and expertise available throughout the public service.  The first Annual Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Development was presented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in June 2008 and has been placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members.

Officials in my Department have, of course, discussed issues with Ambassador Jana regularly since then, and ensured that she is fully aware of my thinking and that of the Government on all relevant issues. Likewise, our Ambassador and his colleagues in our Embassy of Ireland to South Africa have ongoing contact with the South African Authorities.South Africa continues to be a source of stability in the southern African region, and an important partner for both Ireland and the EU. There is a wide range of issues of mutual interest, ranging from trade and development, to regional issues such as the ongoing crises in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in South Africa's neighbour, Zimbabwe. Our South African partners are very well aware of Ireland's deep concerns about the situation in Zimbabwe, and our commitment to an outcome which respects the democratic will of the Zimbabwean people.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	473	Ireland, together with its EU partners, attaches great importance to achieving stability in the countries of the Western Balkans. The European Union's Stabilisation and Association (SAA) process provides the framework for co-operation on economic, political and legal matters and aims to bring countries closer to EU standards and principles. Stabilisation and Association Agreements have now been signed with all the countries in the region except Kosovo.Since the Kosovo Assembly decided to declare independence on 17 February 2008, events in Kosovo have attracted the most attention in the region. On 18 February 2008, EU Foreign Ministers agreed a common response to Kosovo's declaration of independence, reaffirming the EU's willingness to play a leading role in strengthening stability, including by means of the ESDP rule of law mission, EULEX KOSOVO. It also agreed that Member States would decide, in accordance with national practice and international law, on their relations with Kosovo.22 EU Member States, including Ireland, have recognised Kosovo's independence. Following the coming into force of the new Kosovo constitution on 15 June, the EU's main aim has been the smooth transition from the UN mission (UNMIK) to EULEX KOSOVO. The latter declared initial operating capability on 9 December throughout Kosovo, including the Serb majority areas in the North, without serious incident. It includes eight members of the Garda Síochána and one support staff member from the Department of Defence.  During a visit to Kosovo on 22 December, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence met with members of the 233-strong UN-mandated KFOR peacekeeping force and Garda members of EULEX. The visit also included a meeting with President Sejdiu and Prime Minister Thaci. Since then, on 21 January 2009, the new Kosovo Security Force (KSF) was launched and assumed its duties under the supervision of NATO. It comprises 2,500 troops with 800 reservists.A Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) and an Interim Agreement, dealing with economic and trade matters, were signed with Serbia on 29 April 2008. The subsequent arrest of Radovan Karadzic on 21 July 2008 was welcomed by the September GAERC as a major achievement in Serbia's co-operation with the Tribunal. However, the ratification process of the SAA by Member States and the implementation of the Interim Agreement will not proceed until the Council decides unanimously that Serbia is cooperating fully with the ICTY.The November GAERC noted the lack of progress achieved since the signing last June of the SAA with Bosnia-Herzegovina. Enhanced EU engagement was agreed to be necessary, especially during the transition from the Office of the High Representative to that of EU Special Representative, which is expected to happen in 2009. The meeting also highlighted the progress made by Operation ALTHEA towards accomplishing its mandate. Accordingly, the Council considered that preparations for restructuring the operation should continue, taking into account the future role of the EU Special Representative.Croatia is at an advanced stage in its accession negotiations and hopes to bring them to completion as soon as possible, while on 15 December, Montenegro submitted its application to join the European Union. The Czech Presidency is likely to put the latter on the agenda for the Spring European Council. Finally, the EU continues to work closely with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia during its preparation to open EU accession negotiations. Elections are due to be held there in March and the conduct of the poll will influence the Commission's progress report in November.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I remain deeply concerned about the situation in Burma. Recent events there do not suggest that the military regime is in any way planning to ease its grip on the country. Aung San Suu Kyi remains firmly under house arrest and many other activists are also incarcerated. Further political activists were jailed in November last, in some cases for up to 65 years, in what appears to be a wide judicial crackdown against the pro-democracy movement in advance of elections scheduled for next year. Peaceful and spontaneous demonstrations, including those in 2007, have been mercilessly put down. The provisions of the new, deeply flawed, constitution adopted last year are designed to ensure a strong military role in the future governance of the country after promised elections.As I have reported to the House on many previous occasions, the Government remains committed to helping the Burmese people in their struggle for justice, democracy and development.  In pursuit of this goal, the Government has engaged in diplomatic activity at Ministerial and senior official level with Burma's neighbours and in international fora and provided support to groups working to promote democracy, human rights and development for the people of Burma. EU Foreign Ministers last discussed Burma at their meeting on 10 November. We called again for the lifting of restrictions placed on political parties in Burma and the early release of those under detention. We also stated our view that the elections scheduled for 2010 will have no credibility unless all political prisoners are released unconditionally, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi, and a political process is initiated with the support of the United Nations on the basis of an inclusive, long-term dialogue in which the opposition and ethnic groups can participate fully.We very much regret that the UN Security Council has not been able to play the role it should in relation to Burma and the actions of the military regime. After the horrific events in Burma in September 2007, the entire international community committed itself to supporting the UN Secretary General's Good Offices Mission, but there has been insufficient sustained across-the-board political backing for it and, as a result, the regime continues to reject the efforts of the Secretary General's Special Envoy, Dr Ibrahim Gambari, to stimulate political and economic progress. He is planning a return visit, beginning at the end of this month, and is trying to link this to some commitments from the regime, including in relation to the release of political prisoners and a role for the UN in the preparation of the elections. There is some possibility of a visit by the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon. This is something which we would very much welcome if it led to tangible progress.Last week, my Department funded a visit to Ireland by the democratically-elected Members of Burmese Parliamentary Union and the members of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma to enable them to hold their Fourth Congress and Consultation Meeting here. The purpose of the meetings was to plan future strategy; seek to advance national reconciliation and union within Burma itself, and garner the support of the international community so that the process of democratisation in Burma can be furthered. I am delighted that we have been able to support their work in this way.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I have been pleased to be able to report to this House on a number of occasions on the substantial improvement in security in Iraq which has taken place over the last two years. This has been achieved by a combination of enhanced activity by Iraqi and international security forces, but also by progress in internal reconciliation and political action, which we have always stressed would be crucial to making progress.During 2008, security control of almost all Iraqi provinces was returned to Iraqi forces. At the end of 2008, the overarching security role of the UN-mandated MultiNational Force in Iraq came to an end. The Iraqi Government and its security forces are now responsible for security in Iraq. Iraqi security forces have demonstrated significantly improved capabilities, but are not yet able to cope with the serious continuing threats without outside assistance. The presence and the rules governing the remaining international forces in Iraq, principally from the United States, are now established in bilateral arrangements between Iraq and these countries. Furthermore, it is envisaged that the security role of these forces will be progressively reduced, and end in 2011.The widespread reduction in violence has led to a considerable improvement in security for ordinary Iraqis, and a return to something like normal life in many areas.  However, there are still a number of ongoing issues of concern in relation to Iraq. Firstly, the level of violence, while greatly reduced, is still unacceptably high by any normal standard. Remaining militant groups continue to carry out indiscriminate bomb attacks on civilians, especially in Baghdad. In some areas of northern Iraq, especially the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul, issues of ethnic control have led to outbreaks of violence. I have noted with concern here in this House the serious problems Iraqi Christians have faced in this regard.Secondly, the Iraqi parties must use this respite from violence to continue and deepen the work of inter communal reconciliation, which has been too slow.  Thirdly, the overwhelming focus on overcoming violence in recent years means that issues of improving human rights and good governance remain to be tackled. As Iraq struggles to defeat the murderous groups which have attacked its society, we must help it avoid falling back on the brutal methods of previous Iraqi regimes. Finally, a considerable problem remains of internally displaced persons in Iraq and refugees in neighbouring countries, especially Syria and Jordan.  These problems will continue to require the support and encouragement of the international community, including Ireland and its EU partners.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The situation in Afghanistan remains deeply troubling. The deteriorating security environment continues to be of particular concern, especially with regard to the high number of civilian casualties and the impact it is having on reconstruction efforts and the operations of international aid agencies, including Irish non-governmental organisations working in Afghanistan. Figures released by the US Government at the end of last year indicate that the number of insurgent bomb attacks doubled in 2008 to approximately 2,000, as did the number of kidnappings to 250. Very clear difficulties also continue to exist in Afghanistan in relation to human rights, governance and the rule of law, and narcotics.This coming year represents a crucial period for Afghanistan, particularly in light of the scheduled Presidential elections. It is imperative that the electoral process is free and fair and that every effort is made to enable the participation by all communities in Afghanistan in the electoral process.  Close co-operation between Afghanistan and its neighbours remains integral to improving the situation in Afghanistan, including efforts to combat terrorism across the region. In this regard, I welcome the further positive developments in relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the commitments made by their leaders, during the President of Pakistan's first visit to Kabul on 6 January, to eliminate militancy, extremism and terrorism, and to develop a joint strategy for combating terrorism and eradicating drugs.I also welcome the appointment by President Obama of Richard Holbrooke as the new US Special Envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan and the commitment of the incoming administration to address the situation in Afghanistan. The international community continues to have an essential role there and Ireland remains fully supportive of the work of the UN Secretary General's Special Representative Kai Eide. Seven Irish soldiers continue to serve with the UN-mandated International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF).  Ireland has pledged a total of €9 million for relief, reconstruction and development in Afghanistan over the two year period 2008-2009, of which over €5.1 million has been allocated to date. This includes support for the recent establishment of a UN OCHA office — Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs — in Afghanistan to enhance humanitarian co-ordination and advocacy.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 755 and 769 together.Irish Aid's initial emergency contribution of €500,000 to support humanitarian agencies working in Gaza has been provided to the Humanitarian Response Fund, administered by the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. This Fund was established 15 months ago to deliver a rapid response to urgent needs in the case of an unforeseen emergency in the Palestinian Territories, and was identified as an ideal mechanism to fund emergency assistance in response to the current crisis in Gaza. The Fund is open to UN agencies and to both international and national Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). The UN Central Emergency Response Fund, to which Ireland is the seventh largest donor, has also responded rapidly to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with a recent announcement of over US$7 million in assistance.I would note that our emergency contribution of €500,000 is in addition to a comprehensive programme of support to the Palestinian people, which in 2008 totalled €8.6 million — double the amount provided in 2005. This included a contribution of €1.5 million for fuel for Gaza's Power Plant. In addition, €3.8 million was provided in core funding to UNRWA, the UN Agency responsible for the provision of basic services to Palestinian refugees, and which is playing a central role in responding to the humanitarian consequences of the current crisis. In 2008, in recognition of our position as one of its key donors, Ireland was appointed as a member of UNRWA's Advisory Commission, following a Resolution of the UN General Assembly.The European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) provided €73 million in aid to the Palestinian Territories in 2008, making it one of the world's largest donors of humanitarian aid; 56 per cent of this was spent on relief efforts in Gaza. €10.4 million has been allocated for food, emergency shelter repairs and medical support since just before the outbreak of the recent conflict. In addition the European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Louis Michel, undertook a humanitarian mission to Gaza and southern Israel on 25-26 January.  A UN inter-agency mission has been undertaken to determine priority humanitarian needs in Gaza following the ceasefire. Ireland, in co-ordination with other EU donors, will consider further support to the people of Gaza on receipt of this needs assessment and following a full determination of funding requirements.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	478	As is customary at the start of each presidency, the Czech Foreign Minister presented its priorities to the General Affairs Council yesterday (26 January). Under an over-arching motto of "Europe Without Barriers",  the Czech Presidency will focus on the Economy, Energy and the European Union in the World. The first few weeks of their EU Presidency have been dominated by major issues connected with those priorities: the Ukraine-Russia gas crisis and the situation in Gaza. The Czech Presidency will have an important role to play in shaping the Union's continuing response to the current, extremely difficult economic conditions. These events have underlined the value of having our distinctive European nations work closely together under the EU umbrella in order to advance our many shared interests.In addition to the formal briefing at the General Affairs Council, my officials, my colleague Dick Roche and I have had various contacts with Czech counterparts in the run-up to and during the first few weeks of their presidency. I particularly look forward to co-operating with the Presidency in taking work forward on the legal guarantees on the Lisbon Treaty promised to Ireland at the December European Council in response to concerns that surfaced during our referendum campaign. It is important that we finalise these guarantees to our full satisfaction in the coming months.The Czech Presidency is a fitting way to mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet system. I wish the Czech Government well for their Presidency and expect that they will discharge their responsibilities in an effective manner.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	479	The situation in Zimbabwe remains dire. The country has effectively not been governed since March 2008, and after years of mismanagement and neglect, its infrastructure seems to be in terminal collapse. Inflation continues unabated, and those in power have found no better response than to print ever larger banknotes — most recently, a one hundred trillion Zimbabwe dollar note — which then quickly lose their value. Millions of Zimbabweans are dependent on food aid and on what friends and relatives can send them from abroad. One of the most tragic symptoms of the failure of governance in Zimbabwe is the ongoing cholera epidemic, which is estimated by the World Health Organisation to have cost over 2,500 lives. Those who protest against this state of affairs and against the abuse of human rights risk arrest, and there are reports that some of those in custody, including Ms. Jestina Mukoko, may have been tortured.Discussions last week between President Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai resulted in no further progress towards the establishment of a power-sharing government, as agreed in principle last September. The central issue remains the allocation of key Ministries between ZANU-PF and the MDC.  At an Extraordinary Summit on Zimbabwe yesterday, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) outlined a formula for the formation of a unity government by mid-February. There is considerable doubt over whether the MDC has agreed to this formula, and there seem to be few grounds for confidence at this stage that the arrangements proposed will provide a basis for progress towards meaningful a resolution of the current crisis.Zimbabwe's neighbours, who have the greatest influence, must lead international pressure for a solution. For many years, the Zimbabwean Government has sought to deflect attention from its own misdeeds and mismanagement by blaming outsiders, including the EU and many of its Member States, for the country's ills. As a result, the state of EU-Zimbabwe relations is not such that we are able to play a role in bringing the two parties together. The collapse of the Zimbabwean economy and the isolation of the Mugabe regime mean that unfortunately EU leverage is limited, but we are using every avenue open to us.At the General Affairs and External Relations Council yesterday, my EU colleagues and I formally renewed the EU's targeted restrictive measures against individuals and businesses which have supported or participated in the destruction wrought by the Mugabe regime. We also added new names, and a number of companies, to the list. We are determined to target the regime's finances — the revenues used to support the lifestyle of the elite, to keep the security services on its side, and to cushion Mugabe and his cronies from the economic catastrophe they have created.The EU continues to provide humanitarian support to Zimbabweans, and to press for greater involvement by SADC or the African Union in the mediation process. Yesterday, we reconfirmed that the EU stands ready to support the economic and social recovery of Zimbabwe, once a government is formed which reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people, and which returns to respect for human rights, the rule of law and responsible macroeconomic management.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 153 and 758 together.I remain deeply concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe and the appalling suffering of the people there. The humanitarian situation is dire and the World Food Programme is now feeding approximately half the population. This is in a country which was once the bread basket of southern Africa.  Irish non-governmental organisations and missionaries are facing very serious challenges in working in Zimbabwe. Irish Aid is fully supporting them in their work in this most difficult environment.We recently authorised the shipment of essential relief supplies to Zimbabwe from Irish Aid stocks to assist the work of Goal in addressing the cholera outbreak. These supplies consisted of 30,000 jerry cans, 30,000 buckets, 30 tonnes of soap, 1 million water purification tablets, and 60,000 Oral Re-hydration Salts (ORS). The supplies have been arriving in Zimbabwe in a series of shipments and are currently being distributed by Goal staff to benefit 30,000 families affected by the crisis.In 2008, Irish Aid allocated approximately €10.5 million to meet the emergency and development requirements of the Zimbabwean people across a wide range of basic needs and essential services. The sectors assisted included education, primary health care, water and sanitation, human rights, and community and rural development. We are also deeply involved in special programmes to improve the quality and coverage of home based care for people with HIV / AIDS. Irish Aid is also saving lives through support for feeding programmes. These programmes are delivered through a range of valued partnerships including NGOs, missionaries and UN humanitarian agencies.The EU level response to humanitarian crises falls within the responsibility of the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO). In response to the Zimbabwean cholera crisis they have allocated humanitarian funding of more than €9 million aimed both at treating victims of the disease and at stemming its spread. This funding is being provided to UN and non-governmental partner agencies working in Zimbabwe to support water, sanitation and hygiene actions, epidemic response and the provision of essential drugs.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	481	The Cabinet Committee on Aspects of International Human Rights to which the Deputy refers was established last autumn. As part of its remit, the Committee has reviewed the Programme for Government commitments in relation to our total opposition to extraordinary rendition.  As requested by the Committee, the Embassy in Washington on my instructions made early contact with the transition team of the new US Administration to seek a clear statement of intent that  (i) extraordinary rendition would cease and would not resume during the new President's term of office;  (ii) the detention facility at Guantánamo would be closed at the earliest opportunity; and  (iii) intensive interrogation techniques such as water boarding, which are internationally considered to constitute torture, would be clearly prohibited.As the Deputy will be aware, on 22 January President Obama signed three Executive Orders which address these issues. The first of these requires that the Guantanamo detention facility shall be closed as soon as practicable, and at the latest within one year. I warmly welcome this move, for which Ireland has been calling for several years.  A further Executive Order on ensuring lawful interrogations provides that all persons detained following armed conflicts shall, in all circumstances, be treated humanely and shall not be subjected to violence or to outrages to personal dignity. In this regard, the Attorney General-designate, Mr Eric Holder, has made clear during his confirmation hearings that he regards "water-boarding" as a form of torture.  President Obama also established a Task Force which will have among its functions that of evaluating the policy of transferring individuals to third countries to ensure that it complies with all obligations and is sufficient to ensure that all individuals do not face torture and cruel treatment if transferred. We will convey our strong support for the steps taken to date in future contacts with the new Administration at both political and official level, and will continue to follow developments carefully.At the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council yesterday, my EU colleagues and I welcomed the President's decision and began a discussion on how EU Member States might support the closure of Guantanamo. It is clear that there is a range of complex legal and practical issues to be addressed, including the possible resettlement of certain detainees, but we will approach these in a positive spirit and look forward to further dialogue with EU partners and the US Administration. I will remain in close touch with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with a view to consideration by the Government at an appropriate time of any specific proposals.

On the policy front, the Government's priorities remain as set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid. Our assistance to sub-Saharan Africa will continue to be the top priority, as will investment in education, health, the fight against HIV- AIDS, good governance, the promotion of gender equality and measures to counter climate change and rising food prices.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	483	At its meeting on 4 November 2004, the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution A/C.1/59/L.34 urging the Conference on Disarmament to agree on a programme of work that included the immediate commencement of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT). The resolution was overwhelmingly approved by a recorded vote of 147 in favour to 1 against (US) and two abstentions (Israel and UK). Ireland was one of the resolution's co-sponsors.Since the signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), a significant issue for the disarmament and arms control community has been the continued production of fissile materials — the fuel used for nuclear weapons. Many States have long been calling for a ban on the production of fissile materials, and the issue has been on the proposed agenda of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) for many years. The CD has not, however, managed to agree a programme of work since 1999.  Though commonly referred to as a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT), the title is objected to by some States who believe that it prejudges the outcome of negotiations. They would like to see not just the stopping or "cutting-off" of the production of fissile material for weapons purposes, but also the inclusion of existing stocks of weapons-usable fissile material in any agreement.The negotiation of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices is a priority for Ireland, the EU and most States Parties to the Conference on Disarmament. The US, Russia, UK and France have unilaterally declared moratoria on the production of fissile material for weapons purposes although all are believed to consider that they have sufficient stocks of weapons-usable fissile material.The key issues in relation to the Iranian nuclear programme relate to compliance with existing safeguards instruments, and Iran's failure or inability over several years of interaction with the IAEA to demonstrate transparently that it is in compliance. While the existence of an FMCT could only be a positive factor, the most helpful steps in Iran's case would be co-operation with the IAEA, adherence to the Additional Protocol of the NPT, and full compliance with successive Security Council resolutions. The European Union continues to urge Iran to give full co-operation to the IAEA in a spirit of full transparency in relation to its nuclear programme, with a view to solving all outstanding questions. The EU has consistently called upon Iran to demonstrate full proactive and transparent co-operation with the Agency and will continue to do so.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	484	The Mumbai attacks at the end of November were a horrific terrorist offensive against the Government of India, innocent Indian civilians and targeted foreigners. In a statement issued immediately after the attacks began, I said that terrorist atrocities such as those at Mumbai served no purpose except to kill and injure innocent victims, Indian and foreign alike, and to sow panic and suspicion. The attacks represent the latest in a series of terrorist atrocities which have threatened cross-border relations between India and Pakistan and progress in the "composite dialogue", a process established in January 2004 to address contentious issues between the two countries, including Kashmir.Following President Zardari's accession to power in Pakistan and prior to the attacks in Mumbai, there had been a welcome improvement in relations between the countries. At a meeting in September last year, Prime Minister Singh of India and President Zardari pledged to resolve all outstanding issues between them and to bring lasting peace to the region. If good relations between India and Pakistan are to be restored — and this is important in terms of regional stability and development — it is essential that the various issues relating to the Mumbai attacks are resolved between the two countries as quickly and effectively as possible.The Indian Government on 5 January announced that it had handed over evidence on the attacks to Pakistan and that it expected a prompt investigation. The Indian Government has also sought the support of the international community in ensuring that there is an effective response by Pakistan.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland has called on the Government of Pakistan to act decisively and effectively to bring to justice all those involved in the planning, funding and execution of the horrific attacks in Mumbai, and to work constructively with India in this task.  We have reiterated these views and concerns in bilateral meetings with the Embassies of both countries since the Indian documentation was handed over to Pakistan authorities on 5 January. We hope that discussions between the countries can develop on the basis of a shared determination to prevent such tragic events from ever happening again.In this context, it is essential also that India and Pakistan co-operate fully in countering any future terrorist threat. Successive attacks, including the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad on 21 September last, demonstrate that terrorism is as much a threat to the people and Government of Pakistan as it is to India.  Given the key importance of such action for the security of both countries and the protection of their own people and foreigners alike, the EU has made clear its willingness, and wish, to provide technical assistance in relation to counter-terrorism and security. This offer was reiterated by EU Foreign Ministers on 8/9 December. The EU Ministers also placed strong emphasis on the importance of effective regional security cooperation as an essential element in the field of counter-terrorism.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	485	Preparations for the 2010 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) are well under way. The Preparatory Committee for the Review Conference met for two weeks in Vienna in 2007 and in Geneva in 2008 and the third meeting will take place in New York in May 2009. The aim of the preparatory cycle is to reach agreement on the agenda and modalities for the Conference in June 2010, which will review the Treaty and consider ways to promote its full implementation and universality.  It is essential that the 2010 Review Conference ensures the continued vitality, relevance and strength of the NPT, which remains the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. Ireland is working actively and intensively to this end, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to continue to press for nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.The New Agenda Coalition (NAC), launched in Dublin in 1998 and composed of seven like-minded States (including Ireland) committed to enhanced action towards nuclear disarmament, continues to play an important role in the review process. Ireland acted as NAC coordinator and spokesman at the 2007 Preparatory Committee meeting in Vienna.  Ireland is also working closely with civil society and NGOs in preparation for the Review Conference. In March 2008, the Government hosted the fifth meeting of the Article VI Forum of the Middle Powers Initiative (MPI) entitled NPT: Pathfinder to a Nuclear-Free World, which brought together prominent Government and NGO representatives.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	486	The EU opened negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States in September 2002. The negotiations were necessary following a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling that the unilateral trade preferences which the EU had granted to the ACP countries established unfair discrimination between developing countries. The negotiating mandate was derived from the legally-binding Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the ACP States in 2000, with the central objective of "reducing and eventually eradicating poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy".The EU's objective was to conclude comprehensive Agreements with six regional groupings of the ACP States. However, following protracted and difficult negotiations, only one of the regional groupings, the Caribbean Forum of ACP States, was in a position to initial a full Agreement before the deadline of 31 December 2007 which had been established by the WTO. In order to avoid trade disruption, interim Agreements were initialled with 21 other ACP States. The finalisation of the signing of these interim Agreements is essential if the EU is to demonstrate that it has a WTO-compatible trading regime in place, which does not discriminate against non-ACP developing countries.Negotiations for full Agreements are continuing. The Government has worked consistently to ensure that they should support the ACP countries' development needs and their poverty reduction programmes. At meetings of EU Development Ministers, I have stressed the importance of maintaining a flexible negotiating approach which supports the development needs of the ACP countries. I will continue to work with our EU partners, and with partner countries in the developing world, to ensure that the negotiations being led by the European Commission serve to strengthen the partnership with the African Caribbean and Pacific countries.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	487	Through Irish Aid, the Government has provided significant assistance to a number of initiatives with the objective of supporting the rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina following the tragic conflicts in the region during the 1990s. In 2007 Irish Aid provided €86,000 towards an initiative by the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council to assist the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council in Bosnia and Herzegovina in drafting a Book of Rules for courts across the country. In 2006, the Government provided €350,000 to the courts service of Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the development of institutions in the justice sector. Since 2003, funding of €487,000 has been provided to support the work of the war crimes chambers of the Bosnian courts service.I can assure the Deputy that Irish Aid will continue to support rule of law initiatives, as appropriate, in the context of programmes agreed with our partner countries and in our partnerships with NGOs and international organisations throughout the developing world.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	488	As my colleague, Minister of State Peter Power T.D., emphasised during an adjournment debate on this issue on 25 November 2008, Ireland is deeply concerned about displaced Roma families who are residing in camps in Northern Mitrovica, and in particular about reports that residents of these camps are exposed to high levels of lead contamination.  During his visit to Kosovo on 22 December last, the Taoiseach, who was accompanied by the Minister for Defence, met with President Sejdiu and Prime Minister Thaçi. The issue of the displaced Roma was among the topics discussed. The Taoiseach particularly emphasised the plight of a group located at a camp in Gracanica.Prior to that, the issue of the closing of camps and re-locating the occupants had also been discussed at a meeting in Kosovo on 1 December between Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, Finance Minister Ahmet Shala, and a senior official from the EU Commission's Directorate General on Enlargement. The Commission promised the support of all EU institutions operating in Kosovo to ensure that this urgent humanitarian crisis is addressed.  At my request, officials have raised this issue on a number of occasions in recent months, most recently at an EU Working Group meeting on the Western Balkans held just under two weeks ago.  The Kosovar Government has said in response to these representations that it will make every effort to find a new location for the residents of the camps and establish arrangements for co-financing this project with other stakeholders.Ireland has supported a broad range of projects targeted at assisting the Roma community in Kosovo. For the period 2005-2009, Irish Aid has allocated €850,000 towards development work with the Roma community in Kosovo. In addition, €200,000 has been provided for the World Bank's Roma Education Fund, which has benefited the Roma community in eleven countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Kosovo.  Ireland fully supports all efforts to address the plight of the residents of the camps and will remain in contact with the responsible authorities on this issue, including through our Embassy in Budapest, which is accredited to Kosovo.

The latest year for which statistics are available is 2007. Figures for sales by individual exporting Member States of the European Union, and to individual receiving States and regions, may be found in the Council's Annual Report on exports of military equipment. The Tenth Annual Report is in the Official Journal, C 300 of 22.11.2008. Links to all Annual Reports are to be found on the relevant Council website,http://www.consilium.europa.eu/export-controlsOn 8 December 2008, the Council adopted Common Position 2008/944/CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment. This Common Position, which is legally binding on Member States, provides that every application for a licence to export items on the EU Common Military List shall be assessed against eight criteria.These criteria cover matters such as respect for the international obligations and commitments of Member States, in particular the sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council or the European Union; respect for human rights in the country of final destination as well as respect by that country of international humanitarian law; the internal situation in the country of final destination — existence of tension or armed conflict; preservation of regional peace, security and stability; national security of Member States and of friendly and allied countries; terrorism and respect for international law; the risk of diversion, either within the buyer country or by re-export; the compatibility of the particular equipment with the level of development of the country in question. There is provision for liaison and consultation among Member States in assessing licence applications, and of course denials are notified to all Member States in the interests of transparency and consistency.I will continue to cooperate with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to ensure that Ireland fully implements the Council Common Position. The Programme for Government also commits us to support a binding and comprehensive global treaty on the arms trade, covering all weapons and ammunition. Ireland will be actively engaged in the negotiations to this end at the United Nations.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	490	The Government's aid programme, Irish Aid, provides assistance to over ninety developing countries. Nine have been designated as Programme Countries, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance. These are Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, Malawi, Vietnam and Timor Leste. Support to Programme Countries is based on agreed country strategies, with a comprehensive focus on poverty reduction through the implementation of the country's own national development plan.The Government's White Paper on Irish Aid, which was published in 2006, included a commitment to increase the number of key partner countries from eight to ten in the medium term. Malawi was designated Ireland's ninth Programme Country in 2007. An Embassy has been established in Malawi and a programme of strategic support is being developed, focusing on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people, with an emphasis on sustainable food security, nutrition and improvements in agriculture.  Irish Aid has undertaken preliminary work on the identification of a tenth Programme Country. Further analysis will be required before any decision is taken. In keeping with the conclusions of the White Paper on Irish Aid, Africa, with 34 of the world's least developed countries, will remain the primary geographic focus for Ireland's development programme.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	491	I propose to take Questions Nos. 164, 167 and 168 together.Three Departments were reviewed in the pilot phase of the Organisational Review Programme (ORP):  Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Transport.  In conducting the reviews, three forms of questionnaire were deployed and one-to-one interviews and workshops were conducted involving the staff, agencies and bodies and selected stakeholders of the three Departments.  In all, just over 6,000 questionnaires were issued and around 170 meetings were held.Regarding the agencies and bodies under the aegis of the three Departments, 87 questionnaires were issued and 53 responses were received.  These responses were augmented by valuable insights obtained in the course of one-to-one interviews with 25 Chief Executive Officers of such agencies and bodies.  A high level of engagement and candour was displayed by all those who took part in the process and I am most satisfied with the levels of cooperation.  The questionnaires, whereby response was voluntary, were administered on behalf of the ORP Team with a guarantee of confidentiality by an independent market research company, Hudson Talent Management.  The Team therefore does not hold details of those who did not respond.Concerning the identity of those agencies and selected stakeholders of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to whom questionnaires were issued, the position is set out in the table.AgenciesSelected stakeholdersBord BiaConsumer Liaison Panel SecretariatCOFORDIrish Cattle and Sheep Farmers’ AssociationCoillte TeorantaIrish Co-operative Organisation SocietyIrish National StudIrish Creamery and Milk Suppliers’ AssociationNational Milk AgencyIrish Farmers’ AssociationTeagascMacra na FeirmeRegarding the agencies of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I understand that 5 out of 6 responded to the questionnaire and 3 meetings were held.  It should be noted that at the time of the issue of the questionnaires, the fisheries function had only recently been transferred to the Department.  As therefore their experience of working with their new Department was very limited, questionnaires were not issued to the agencies in the fisheries sector.In the case of selected stakeholders, questionnaires were issued to 6 organisations that are predominantly stakeholders of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and these were supplemented by 13 meetings with stakeholders of the Department, including ‘cross cutting' Departments and other bodies, and 9 meetings at EU level, including some dealing exclusively with agriculture issues.Regarding the commitment of agencies to public service reform, my Department has asked the Secretaries General of all Government Departments to ensure that the Government Statement on Transforming Public Services and the recommendations of the Task Force on the Public Service are widely disseminated within each Department and Office, the bodies and agencies under their aegis and across the wider public service.   I am satisfied that the public service, including its agencies, will cooperate with the implementation of the transformation agenda.The overall programme of public service renewal and modernisation is being driven by the Cabinet Committee on Transforming Public Services.  I am the chair of the Cabinet Committee and its membership includes the Ministers for Finance; Education and Science; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Health and Children; and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In addition, a Programme Office is being established in my Department to support Departments and agencies in their change efforts and to support the Government in driving, co-ordinating and monitoring progress in implementation.  This work will involve ongoing intensive contact with Ministers, their Departments and agencies and with the entire public service and I believe that all public bodies, including agencies, will engage fully with this process.

The report indicates that, overall, good progress has been made in relation to the implementation of Regulatory Impact Analysis across Departments, with some 74 produced in the period between June 2005 and February 2008.  The Government has agreed to implement the recommendations contained in the report which concern the RIA model itself, its use by Departments and its management across Government.The Better Regulation Unit of my Department is working closely with the interdepartmental RIA Network, which it chairs, to implement certain recommendations arising from the report including the preparation of revised RIA guidelines and training materials.   It is expected that the revised guidelines and training will be available shortly.  The Unit have already made a number of presentations to officials outlining the changes to the RIA system resulting from the Review.  In addition, the Unit is also working closely with the RIA Network to improve arrangements for the publication of legislation and related RIAs on Departmental websites.  Of course, while the RIA Network provides a useful focal point for Departments to learn from each other in terms of RIA best practice, a number of recommendations which are contained in the report are ultimately for Departments themselves to implement.

Its main objective is to advise Electrical Contractors of their responsibilities under the Registered Employment Agreement (REA) for the Electrical Industry and it also carries out inspections of Electrical Contractors in order to ensure compliance with the agreement. While the organisation does not have statutory authority under employment rights legislation to undertake such inspections, Electrical Contractors have in the past been in general willing to facilitate, and cooperate with, these arrangements.The registration of employment agreements, such as the Electrical Contracting Industry REA, is a matter for the Labour Court, as provided for in the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  Enforcement of the provisions of the REA for the Electrical Sector is effected through the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations legislation. While National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) does not have a formal relationship with EPACE, it does investigate complaints referred to it by any person and, in so doing, it may also examine information furnished by EPACE in relation to alleged breaches of the REA for the Electrical Contracting Sector.Section 45 of the Employment Law Compliance Bill as published last year is intended to support and enhance monitoring and inspection activity in relation to compliance with the Registered Employment Agreement in the electrical contracting industry. The Bill is expected to reach Second Stage early in this Dáil term.  In the meantime current arrangements continue to apply.

An employer who makes a statutory redundancy payment to an employee is entitled to apply for a rebate of 60% of the total cost from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).

The appropriate form may be obtained from the Tribunal or from the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA). In such cases, the Tribunal is empowered to issue a determination without rehearing the case and, if it upholds the claim, to confirm the recommendation of the Rights Commissioner in its determination.If the case was heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal the employee, or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on behalf of the employee, may apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to implement the Tribunal determination. The Circuit Court may issue an order directing the employer to implement the terms of the Tribunal determination or if it considers it appropriate in cases where the Tribunal directed the re-instatement or re-engagement of the employee, alter that determination to make an order for financial compensation to the employee concerned.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I propose to take Questions Nos. 186, 187, 190 and 192 together.After prolonged and detailed discussions on revised proposals over several EU Presidencies, the Council of Ministers at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, on 9 June 2008, reached political agreement, by qualified majority, on a Common Position on revised working time rules. Throughout the discussions on this sensitive dossier, Ireland has adopted a pragmatic approach to the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the Council's Common Position.  A core aspect of the Common Position relates to the opt-out whereby a worker may agree with his or her employer to work hours which exceed the 48-hour limit, subject to certain protective conditions. Here, the Council supported a continuation of the opt-out but under a series of strengthened protections and a new series of checks and balances. For its part, the European Parliament, in its Plenary Vote, on 17th December 2008, sought the phasing out of the opt-out after three years.As the Council has not accepted the amendments of the European Parliament, the proposal now passes to conciliation. The Czech Presidency is currently formulating, with Member States, the Council mandate for this next phase. Ireland will continue to adopt a constructive approach in the delicate negotiations ahead on revised working time proposals in an endeavour to reach a successful conclusion with Parliament and a satisfactory compromise solution acceptable to Member States.  Along with more than twenty other EU Member States, Ireland has responded to a letter of observations transmitted by the European Commission on the transposition into national law of the Working Time Directive 2003/88/EC, having regard to European Court of Justice (ECJ) case law. Ireland endeavours to meet in full its obligations under Community law and will continue to do so.Indeed, the revised Council proposals currently for conciliation do endeavour, as was the stated intention of the European Commission who first tabled these proposals, to have regard to the need to review the current Directive, having regard to ECJ case law. The successful completion of the negotiation of revised rules on working time, under the current conciliation phase between Council and Parliament, will allow the European Commission as guardians of the Treaty, to draw their own conclusions on the extent to which legislation in the various Member States correctly transpose the requirements of Directives in this area of activity.

The policy was developed to ensure that appropriate actions are taken by management throughout the organisation to identify and manage effectively the risks to which the organisation may be exposed. The registers seek to identify and assess the potential strategic, operational, financial and reputational risks facing the Department and to outline controls and measures to minimise such risks. The risk register is updated on an annual basis and controls are implemented on an on-going basis. FÁS was included on the risk register in those years to ensure that relevant risks were identified and controls and measures identified to minimise those risks.

I am keenly aware of the impact this decision will have on Dell's employees and their families. The relevant State agencies under the remit of my Department are working to take the appropriate actions to support those to be made redundant to find new employment, including assistance to re-skill and re-train to enhance their future employment potential.FÁS Mid-west has put in place a team to deal specifically with redundancies in Dell and other companies in the Region.  As an initial step, the following services have been offered to Dell employees at a meeting held on their premises on the 12th January last.Group Briefing Sessions for staff to outline the range of FÁS Services available to themIndividual one to one guidance interviews will includeIdentification of current qualifications and job requirementsProvision of information on job opportunities, Mid-west, national and EUIdentification of upskilling training requirementsProvision of a broad range of training programmes in responseReferral to educational providers where appropriateReferral to Enterprise Boards regarding Start Your Own Business initiatives, where appropriate.In addition FÁS will be hosting Training/Job Opportunities events in Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary.  These events will have local, national and European vacancies on display as well as employers in attendance.I am also conscious of the implications of job losses in Limerick and the entire Mid West area.  In this respect, IDA Ireland has been working diligently to secure new investments, and over the last year companies like Vistakon, Zimmer, Cook, DTS and Microsemi have had announcements in the Region. The Agency currently has a pipeline of projects under consideration. These potential investments are being pursued and IDA will do everything possible to speed up the investment decisions in Limerick's favour.In addition, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards in the Mid-west provide a range of services and supports to indigenous small and medium sized companies in the region and will be very much involved in supporting Dell workers that may be considering business start-ups.  I have already announced my intention to establish a Task Force for the Mid-west region.  At the time of preparation of this reply, final details of the Task Force are being finalised.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	516	According to Statutory Instrument No. 168 of 1997: Labour Services Act 1987 — Apprenticeship Rules 1997, "A person entering employment as an Apprentice in a trade where it is deemed necessary by An Fóras, must pass a vision test approved by An Fóras". In accordance with this Statutory Instrument, FÁS have prescribed the Ishihara Colour Vision Test 24 Plate Edition as the minimum standard for health and safety reasons required for several trades. These include the following trades:  Agricultural Mechanics, Aircraft Mechanics, Construction Plant Fitting, Electrical, Electrical Instrumentation, Electronic Security Systems, Mechanical Automation & Maintenance Fitting, Floor & Wall Tiling, Heavy Vehicle Mechanics, Instrumentation, Motor Mechanics, Painting & Decorating, Print Media, Refrigeration & Air Conditioning and Vehicle Body Repairs.FÁS have informed me that they sought medical advice on the use of coloured filters to enable a person to pass a colour vision test.  The medical advice stated that coloured filters are only effective while in use.  A potential employee who can pass a colour vision test using such filters will be unable to distinguish between colours without the filters. The advice also stated that some tasks at work requiring good colour discrimination would not be possible even when filters are used, despite them enabling the person concerned to pass a colour vision test.Such a candidate will therefore be unsuited for any occupations in which colour discrimination or recognition is important and will be dangerous in some occupations if the colour defect is moderate or severe.  In addition, it cannot be assumed that the candidate will always use the colour filters when they are required at work, nor can it be assumed that the filters will always be effective when worn at work to discriminate colours. Therefore allowing a candidate to pass the colour vision test by using coloured filters poses an unacceptable health and safety risk.

The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency. While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.Currently, there are 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in South Tipperary, employing over 3,000 people.  In the context of promoting foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland works closely with the educational institutions in the region to ensure that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value–added employment to South Tipperary are being developed. The agency also works with the Industrial Training agency FÁS to ensure that the needs of industry in the areas of training and up-skilling are being met.  Employment in South Tipperary, over the period 2005 to Q3 2008  has been positively progressing in an upward trend as measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, published by the CSO.  This compares favourably with the rest of the country.In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA Ireland is focused on delivering investments to all of the Gateway and Hub locations.  IDA's strategy for South Tipperary is to concentrate future economic development in Clonmel and to develop the town as a first-class location for overseas investment. This strategy has been agreed with the South Tipperary County Council.  As Ireland competes for investments at the highest end of the value chain the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny. Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, effective physical and digital infrastructure coupled with availability of sophisticated professional support services. If we are to continue being successful in realising a large proportion of our investments outside of the larger cities, all economic and social stakeholders will need to adhere to the framework on which the NSS is constructed.

The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.The Boards are widely dispersed geographically and provide a single point of contact at local level for new and established small businesses.  All areas of the country are served by and benefit from, the full range of Enterprise Board grant supports and entrepreneurial development programmes.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria enterprises may access assistance and support from the CEBs.  The forms of financial assistance which are available, subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business networks.The cost of administering the CEB network is primarily made up of payroll costs and associated expenditure — travel costs, office accommodation, etc.  Typically, each CEB would have between 4 and 5 staff.  The total number of staff employed by the CEBs nationally is about 150, a figure that has been broadly constant for several years. The focus of CEB activity has been increasingly on the provision of "soft" supports — management training, mentoring, advisory and information services, etc.  A significant allocation is made to the CEBs each year for the provision of these soft support or Measure 2 activities. In addition, CEB staff would be engaged on a daily basis in the provision of an informal information and advisory service to local entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs.The Capital Allocation for the 35 CEBs under the 2009 Estimates Process stands at €20.8m. The Boards will continue to be actively involved in the area of economic development and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.  This will be done not just by direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.

Accordingly, if an employment permit holder wishes to change employer then a new application will have to be made. However, under the Act a new application for an employment permit cannot be considered, except in exceptional circumstances, until a period of 12 months has elapsed since the foreign national concerned first commenced employment in the State.  In the event that the foreign national is the holder of a Working Holiday Authorisation then they are free to seek other employment until their visa expires.

The purpose of CE is to help unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.  CE is not designed to cater for short-term unemployed persons as they are not as far removed from the open labour market as the main client group for the programme. All CE places are filled on an ongoing basis, as the demand always exceeds the number of places available.To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 Minister Micheál Martin revised the 3-year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year overall period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April 2000).  This was in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into employment.  The current eligibility criteria set by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for entry onto the Community Employment programme allows for the combination of periods on different social welfare payments provided they add up to at least 12 consecutive months and the person is currently in receipt of the payment at the time of application. Persons in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit can normally apply for Jobseekers Allowance when their contribution-based payment is exhausted. This would maintain the continuity to make up the 12-month eligibility period.The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  There is a wide range of client groups that benefit from access to CE — lone parents, persons with disabilities, stabilised substance abusers and unemployed persons.  FÁS at all times is obliged to accommodate the needs of all these groups in terms of participation on Community Employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support into the future the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities. In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.

While I may give general policy directives to the agencies, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings, or from giving preference to one area over others. A range of strategies, programmes and financial incentives are in place to promote economic development that will give rise to sustainable employment throughout Kildare including Naas.  The strategies and programmes of the development agencies are very much in line with the National Development Plan and the National Spatial Strategy, which have been specifically designed to foster economic development and job creation across the country as a whole.Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA work closely together and, through their network of regional and overseas offices, interact with existing and prospective clients in an effort to identify opportunities for investment and growth and thereby job creation.   In addition, the training and enterprise development agencies are active participants in the County Development Boards and collaborate with other stakeholders in the county to promote the infrastructure and environment for enterprise and job creation.  In the five-year period 2004 to 2008, a total of 165 new jobs were created in 2 IDA supported companies in Naas.Enterprise Ireland is actively involved in assisting Naas-based client companies to grow and develop their businesses.  Since the beginning of 2005, EI has approved over €15m in support to companies in Kildare, including companies in Naas, to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets. One of the main sectors of indigenous industry in County Kildare is Food & Consumer Products.  New companies — now leaders in the consumer products market — have been established and have created new employment.  The Green Isle Foods expansion investment, which is supported by Enterprise Ireland will lead to the creation of 130 new jobs at full production.  Dawn Farm Foods Ltd. has undertaken a major investment of €28m in its Naas plant, again with the support of Enterprise Ireland, which will generate 100 new jobs.Kildare County Enterprise Board provides a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases.  During the years 2003 to 2007 Kildare CEB paid out €1,439,078.70 in grant assistance to 98 projects, which in turn created 276 new jobs in the County.Due to the downturn in the economy unemployment is increasing across the country as a whole.  This situation is regrettable, particularly to those who have lost their jobs and their families.  Unwelcome as it is this situation is an indication of the challenges that are now facing the labour market and the economy as a whole.  In an effort to alleviate the hardships for those involved FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working closely together so they can respond quickly to the increase in unemployment.   For example, it has been agreed that redundant apprentices will be referred immediately to FÁS rather than wait for three months on the Live Register.   And the Agency has also put in place a series of actions to facilitate redundant apprentices in completing their studies.In conjunction with the Local Employment Services, FÁS has geared up its Employment Services to provide increased capacity for expected increased referrals from the Live Register.  FÁS has also established a training fund to enable a speedy response to identified re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers.  In a strategy aimed at meeting the needs of those who were recently active in the workforce and who now find themselves unemployed, FÁS will open its evening classes free of charge to people who are unemployed.

The pharmaceutical company Wyeth Biopharma has established the world's largest biopharma campus facility investing €1.8 billion here. The company currently employs approximately 1,300 highly skilled people. Microsoft has announced plans to invest $500m in the construction of a data centre and will employ up to 75 people. The agency,  in conjunction with South Dublin County Council, will continue to market the area to new and existing client companies.Since the beginning of 2005 to date, Enterprise Ireland has approved support in excess of €19.5m and made payments of over €10.4m to companies in South County Dublin to enhance their capacity, capability and performance.  The agency supports the provision of incubation space for start up companies and works towards enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level by supporting research in companies and Third Level Institutions. The M50 Enterprise Platform Programme is under way in the Institute of Technology in Tallaght, in conjunction with Blanchardstown Institute of Technology and Dublin City University.The agency also works closely with the Tallaght Institute of Technology in encouraging the commercialisation of research and has approved financial support of over €2.6m to the Institute for the development and management of an Incubation Centre. This Centre provides entrepreneurs with affordable space in an environment which provides support for them to research their new ideas and  affords them the opportunity to bring about new indigenous businesses. The agency has also approved support of €1.225m for a Centre of Excellence at the Institute of Technology Tallaght, the focus of which is Microsensors for Clinical Analysis.The South Dublin County Enterprise Board delivers a series of Programmes to underpin its role and provides both financial and non-financial assistance to project promoters. During 2009, the CEB will continue to support enterprise development in the area through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.The Training and Employment Authority FÁS is helping unemployed people to review their options and develop a meaningful career plan which takes account of the opportunities in the current labour market. This will also prepare them for the economic upturn when it comes.  Additional training courses are being provided to help people acquire new skills and be better equipped for the challenges that lie ahead.  I am satisfied that the policies being pursued and the actions being taken will continue to address the needs of Tallaght and the surrounding area in these difficult times.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I propose to take Questions Nos. 214, 215 and 221 together.Funding is available from the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) for workers in EU Member States made redundant as a result of globalisation and changing global trade patterns. Strict eligibility criteria apply such as the formal individual notification of redundancy to at least 1,000 workers within a reference period of 4 months for a given enterprise and its suppliers, or within a reference period of 9 months for a given industrial sector. Redundancies which have occurred prior to the reference period are not deemed eligible. Member States then have a time limit of 10 weeks from the date all EGF conditions are met to submit an application for funding from the EGF.With regard to the 1,900 redundancies recently announced by DELL at its Limerick plant, I understand that no formal notification of individual redundancies has yet issued to employees. As such, no application for assistance from the EGF can be advanced at this time. However, when this condition and the other relevant eligibility criteria are met, it is my intention to submit an application for assistance.Notwithstanding the position in relation to the making and timing of any application to the European Commission for EGF support, FÁS has put in place a dedicated team to assist workers at DELL in terms of individual skills assessment, occupational guidance and advice, job search assistance and the provision of training. FÁS is working collaboratively with other statutory agencies and educational institutions in the Mid West Region in this regard. Furthermore, a Task Force is being put in place to assess, and make recommendations to my Department on, the most appropriate responses to offset and compensate for industrial job losses in the region arising from the proposed job losses at DELL.In relation to the company referred to by Deputy Deasy, I understand that no formal notification of redundancies has issued to its employees to date and therefore, again, no application for assistance from the EGF can be processed at this time. In addition, the 1,000 redundancy threshold and other relevant intervention criteria must also be met before the making of an application can be contemplated.On 16th December 2008, the European Commission tabled proposals to amend EGF intervention criteria in order to increase its capacity as an effective response and support instrument in the context of the current global economic and financial situation. The proposals include a halving of the trigger number of redundancies and other new intervention criteria and procedural amendments.  Discussions between the European Commission and Member States on these proposals commenced earlier this month and are ongoing. As such, their final outcome, which will not be known until later this year, cannot be anticipated at this stage.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	529	The State development agencies under the remit of my Department have adopted a coordinated approach in response to job losses in Arklow and South Wicklow in recent times.  The agencies are working together to assist workers transition to new employment, and to promote and facilitate enterprise in the region, including the promotion of Arklow as a location for foreign direct investment. IDA Ireland is actively working with Arklow Chamber of Commerce and Wicklow County Council and the management of Allergan to promote Arklow as a location for a replacement industry or alternative project.  IDA has met management of the company to get a profile of the workforce and has conducted a detailed audit of the facilities.  IDA also met with the Arklow Chamber of Commerce and Wicklow County Council to profile the strengths and attractions of the location and to put a value proposition in place to allow IDA's sectoral and overseas divisions to effectively market the location abroad.  In light of the existing experienced workforce, the location and facilities available, IDA intends to target Medical Technologies and Business Services operations for the town.IDA Ireland continues to promote Arklow and County Wicklow for new business and has participated in a number of Wicklow Business Showcase seminars over the last year to attract new business to the county.  Servier has been implementing the expansion that they announced in 2006 to create 112 new jobs in Arklow, and have been recruiting for some of these positions over the last year.  Sigma-Aldrich Corporation announced in April 2008 its plans to invest US$2 million to construct a new warehouse and to centralise all customer support activities for its Ireland business at the company's Arklow site.  A number of other companies in or adjacent to County Wicklow have expanded rapidly with IDA assistance, including Takeda in Bray now employing 400 plus, and  ServiceSource and Covidien in Cherrywood.  Enterprise Ireland continues to work with its sister development agency IDA Ireland, FÁS, and the County Development boards in a coordinated approach to job losses in recent times.  This approach is directed at assisting any relevant employees affected and has two objectives: To enhance and facilitate the future employment prospects of the workforce and; to identify and support any individual who wishes to start their own business.Enterprise Ireland exhibited at both the Wicklow Showcase event in November 2008 and the joint agencies open day business start-up advisory sessions for Allergan staff held over two afternoons on December 16th and 17th 2008, at the Arklow Enterprise Centre.  The role of FÁS, the State training agency, is particularly important in assisting those who are being made redundant.  FÁS is providing advice and training opportunities for those losing their jobs.  A total of 61 staff from Allergen registered with FÁS over the past year, and a number of them were funded to take up training of one sort or another.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the State development agencies and other interested parties together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will continue to bear fruit in terms of investment and employment for County Wicklow.

The Centre focuses on the development of skills used in Civil Engineering and Commercial Building sectors.  This centre supports the thinking that informed the construction legislation and regulations behind the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS). Essentially this is to develop skills in construction workers that will protect workers through safe working practices in occupations that pose significant risk. The Centre will also undertake trainer assessments.The total development cost of the centre is €6.78 million. This includes the original projected construction costs and additional costs due to compliance with various safety and environmental requirements, together with County Council and ESB fees.  The land, which is the site for the FÁS National Construction Centre at Mountlucas, Co. Offaly is owned by Bórd Na Mona and is leased to FÁS for an annual rent of €10,000 per year.The working model for the facility was designed to be flexible in scale, the initial planned staffing was for 7 in total. This is comprised of 1 Assistant Manager (Grade 7), 4 Instructors (Grade 8), 1 Administration Assistant (Grade 10) and 1 General Assistant (Grade 13). Other private contractors will be contracted as second providers as demand requires. The current staffing is 3 (Grades 7, 8 and 10) in order to bring the facility and its systems to operational standard.The construction of this project is just complete and it is now at the normal snagging stage with contractors still on site, thus operation of the facility has not commenced. The first course on Construction Plant Equipment Operation is due to commence at the end of February and preparations for this are now taking place.The strategy behind the training facility is to develop skills in a safe, purpose-built facility so that both experienced and new entrants develop skills on site in real time with real risks, bearing in mind the nature of the equipment involved such as heavy earthmoving and cranes etc. This is seen within the industry as desirable and indeed best practice. It mirrors the approach in other countries such as the UK and Australia.The projected number of trainees forecast to use the Centre at the time the project was initiated was expected to be not below 12,000 per annum. While there has been a considerable downturn in the construction sector the facility has been developed with flexibility in mind; a portion of the facility will now be dedicated to providing general and specific skills training such as: IT, administration, enterprise development, driving, retail and services, to people who are unemployed from the local area and towns.

For an employer to be eligible under the scheme they must not have made an apprentice redundant since 1st January 2007 and they must not displace an existing apprentice.The first scheduled intake for off-the-job training for 2009 commenced with the release of apprentices by employers on the 5th January 2009 to the Institutes of Technology.  FÁS has been in contact with the eligible employers who have released apprentices for off-the-job training to request their support for the placement of a redundant apprentice with the Employer.  To date 83 employers have expressed an interest in the scheme and FÁS expects that approximately 85 redundant apprentices will commence their on-the-job experience under the scheme over the next number of weeks.  FÁS is actively in contact with eligible companies to make the necessary arrangements for the placement of redundant apprentices during the course of 2009.

In addition, I am advised that all labour and trade union law on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to employees with a disability in the same way as it applies to other employees.Under the Programme for Government  "A Blueprint for Ireland's Future 2007-2012" the Department is committed to putting in place a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities to help them to work in all sectors.  This strategy is a key component of the Sectoral Plan for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.An outline of how a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities will be implemented has been developed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and has received a positive response from key stakeholders who are represented on the Consultative Forum on an Employment Strategy that has been established under the Department's Sectoral Plan.  The aim of this strategy is to address the diversity of circumstances, needs and abilities of people with disabilities, and to work towards the highest possible levels of employment for them.  It is intended that the outline for the implementation of this strategy will be completed in the near future.

In addition, part of the ongoing work has been to remove many of the lower branches from the trees in order to provide better visibility for visitors to the cemetery.  Removal of ivy from tree trunks and monuments has also been undertaken.  The area at the eastern end of the cemetery has been grassed and the re-surfacing of the eight kilometres of paths has begun.

In regard to the Valuation Act, 2001, I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Act, and that I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) are rateable unless expressly exempted under schedule 4.  Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 outlines the categories of property and the various uses that are deemed to be non rateable under the Act. Paragraphs 10 (education) and 16 (charitable purposes) are two areas in that schedule which may be relevant to the ratability of child care facilities.  Accordingly, purpose-built childcare buildings designed and used to make profit are rateable as commercial buildings. Houses which have been adapted for commercial use in a dedicated area (i.e. converted garage for exclusive use as childcare) are rateable, for that specific area.The Valuation Act 2001 maintains the long-standing position that commercial facilities — including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools — are liable for rates.  It was not intended that the Valuation Act 2001 would expand or contract the valuation base.The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property.  Any individual ratepayer who has concerns about the valuation of their property or of any part thereof, including its ratability or the method of calculation may, on payment of a statutory fee of €250, apply to the Valuation Office for a revision of the valuation.  If dissatisfied with the outcome, they may appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.

Following the completion of the scheme, the Office of Public Works sought and received the assistance of the Central Fisheries Board to identify and subsequently address this problem.A fishery rehabilitation programme was designed by the CFB, in conjunction with the then Department of the Marine, to provide additional spawning beds throughout the catchment.  As a result of the implementation of this programme, it was estimated that there a 20% increase in spawning bed areas post-drainage, compared to the pre-drainage position.Moreover, fishery survey work showed that the removal as part of the drainage scheme of a large number of stone weirs and the silt accumulated by these structures over hundreds of years led to the restoration of the natural morphology of a long channel reach from Trim to Navan.  This resulted in an estimated increase of circa 30,000 salmon smolts, per annum, following the completion of this aspect of the drainage programme.In recent years, the OPW have worked closely with Regional and Central Fisheries Board personnel to adapt drainage maintenance programmes in order to minimise the impacts of such programmes on fish stocks.  This initiative has been broadened since 2008 to generate enhancement plans for all drained river corridors within the remit of OPW, with the aim of ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive.

I have been informed by the Financial Regulator that it met Friends of Banking Ireland on 13 November 2008 and that a number of issues relating to the role of the Financial Regulator, the reach of the consumer protection code, the complaints process for individual redress and the confidentiality obligations under which it operates were clarified.  Further contact was to be maintained between the two organisations to pursue outstanding matters.Complaints from individual consumers (which includes incorporated bodies with a turnover of up to €3 million) are referred to and determined by the Financial Services Ombudsman.  However, the general principles of the Consumer Protection Code apply to all dealings between regulated firms and all customers and not just for consumers as defined above.I do not accept that there is a case for a commissioner of investigation, as proposed by Friends of Ireland Banking, to address the particular issues raised at this time.  Reviews have commenced on the Regulator's strategic regulatory approach and also on its business processes and procedures.  I look forward to receiving the outcome of those reviews as quickly as possible.  Furthermore, speedy progress is being made at an EU level on a common approach to enhanced financial regulation.  Any decision on financial regulatory reform will be informed by and consistent with the outcome of these national and international reviews.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	550	I propose to take Questions Nos. 242, 262 and 279 together.In the area of prudential regulation, the Financial Regulator applies regulatory rules to a range of banking activities in accordance with national, EU and international requirements.  The importance of having a regulatory system that provides financial stability and fosters probity has become all the more clear to us now in a time of severe financial dislocation, both nationally and internationally.  I have already acknowledged that there were shortcomings in the financial regulation oversight of our banks, not least in the case of the concealment of loans to former directors of Anglo Irish Bank, which has done serious damage not only to the Bank concerned but to Irish banking generally.  A better form of regulation is now required with a greater degree of focus on areas such as risk management, compliance, liquidity management and general control processes.There are a number of reviews under way within the Financial Regulator with a view to identifying any shortcomings in the Financial Regulator's strategic regulatory approach, its structures and its capacity to respond.  I await with interest the outcomes of these reviews and will be working with the Regulatory Authority to bring about improvements in our system of financial regulation.  As the Deputy will appreciate, steps have already been taken in that regard in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme and, as a result of this, the oversight of the banks concerned has been greatly intensified.The new regulatory framework in Ireland must also have regard to EU and international developments in the global financial regulatory framework.  In relation to the EU, there are a number of proposals being developed for adoption this year, including improvements to the Capital Requirements Directive to further strengthen the existing banking prudential framework for risk management.  Furthermore, the role and mandates of national regulators has been the subject of in-depth consideration by the ECOFIN Council.Common reporting standards for financial institutions are being introduced to enable greater EU wide consistency in supervision.  Proposals will be introduced this year following the report of the de Larosiére Group, on ensuring prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight, early warning mechanisms and crisis management.  An initial report on this matter is due to be submitted to the Spring European Council and any reform of our Financial Regulator's structures will be consistent with EU developments.  In view of the national and international reviews of financial regulator frameworks already under way, I do not consider that a separate commission of investigation would be appropriate at this time.

A national construction industry project was conducted between 2006 and 2008. For the duration of this project, Revenue assigned 25% of its audit and compliance resources to monitoring this industry. All of Revenues compliance interventions are risk driven, and use all available sources of information in the selection of cases for audit. In this context, planning information is frequently used as a source of intelligence for tax audits in the construction sector. Typically, the planning records can help with cross-regional construction tax investigation or with a single audit of a particular taxpayer.For example, one Revenue region carried out 772 site visits to ‘one-off' building projects in the period 2006 to 2008. Planning data was used to source some of these cases. In 2008 another Revenue region looked at all planning permissions granted in their area in 2006.  Several lines of enquiry are being followed up and the project will be reviewed later this year to see if it was cost-effective. Commencement notices are also checked to identify the sites where work is taking place.Revenue is satisfied that its approach to compliance is effective in identifying abuses and evasion in this sector. Over the period 2006 to 2008 (incl), over 10,500 audits were carried out in the sector with a direct additional yield to the Exchequer of €356m in tax interest and penalties.  A further €29m was collected as arrears in these cases.

A principal contractor must operate RCT on payments to subcontractors not only where the construction work being carried out relates to a third party construction project but also in a situation where the construction work is carried out on the principal contractor's private residence.I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the son of a builder would not have to register as a principal contractor and implement RCT solely because he was related to a person who was involved in the construction industry.  However, section 531(1)(c) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 requires the operation of RCT where a person who is connected with a company carrying on a construction business undertakes construction operations. Therefore, a builder's son would only be obliged to register as a principal contractor and operate RCT in connection with the building of a warehouse on his land, if he (that is, the son) was connected with a construction company. In this context, "connected" requires the son or the son and persons connected with him (e.g. his father) to have a controlling interest in the construction company.  This rule would not operate if the father's construction operation is unincorporated.There is no discriminatory treatment in the RCT legislation against family members of those engaged in the construction industry. Indeed, the legislation is carefully worded to ensure that any such discrimination is avoided by ensuring that a connection created by a family relationship is, in itself, not sufficient to bring a person within the RCT provisions.

The income receivable from the letting of premises such as self-catering accommodation is regarded as rental income and assessed accordingly. Income from the operation of hotels and bed and breakfast establishments is regarded as trading income and different rules apply to the assessment of such income. While the computation of the tax liability is broadly similar for both types of income, there are some differences. For example, in a rental situation where expenses exceed rents, the loss can only be used to reduce taxable rental income in years subsequent to that in which the loss arises whereas trading losses can be used to reduce other non-trading taxable income in the same year as that in which the loss arises, but can only be used to reduce taxable income from the same trade where it continues to be carried on in subsequent years.I would also point out that the less favourable treatment of rental losses as against trading losses also applies to other non-trading losses such as losses arising from the disposal of capital assets or losses arising from the exploitation of certain intellectual property.I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no anomaly in the different treatment of both types of income. Rather, there is a long-standing legislative distinction in the tax code between exploiting the rights of ownership of land and property to generate investment (e.g. rental) income and the carrying on of a trade or profession. Over time various court cases have established the principle that income derived from rights over property is very unlikely to be trading income.

The income levies introduced in the Finance Acts 1983 and 1993 operated on the same basis.

Credit Unions, being themselves "relevant deposit takers" (under Section 256 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) who operate DIRT, are not subject to the DIRT provisions on the interest arising on their deposits with banks or other relevant deposit takers.  Accordingly the question of separate records, which would distinguish an amount that would have been paid in DIRT on such Credit Union deposits by each of the banks, does not arise.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested, estimated by reference to the income tax year 2009, is as follows:Gross IncomeNumbers€0 – €16,953551,300€16,954 – €18,35447,000€18,355 – €32,272462,400€32,273 – €38,329173,500€38,330 – €45,000160,200€45,001 – €52,000132,500Over €52,001511,900Total2,038,800The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2005 adjusted as necessary for income and employment growth for the year in question. They are, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised.  The figures for income and employment growth used are based on macro-economic indicators which have been recently revised in the light of the latest economic outlook for 2009.  Figures in the table are rounded to the nearest hundred.  It should be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.

Where a worker receives a lump sum payment on the termination of his/her employment and returns to the employment a short time later Revenue would have to have regard to all the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In circumstances where Revenue are not satisfied that there has, in fact, been a genuine termination the lump sum payment would be regarded as normal income of the employment and taxed as such.The issue of redundancy and re-engagement of employees was addressed in an article published in Tax Briefing 54 (Dec 2003), a copy of which is available in the Revenue website at http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/tax-briefing/archive.html A detailed explanation of the reliefs available in respect of lump sums on retirement or removal from an office or employment is outlined in Revenue Leaflet IT 21 — a copy of this leaflet is available on the Revenue website at http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it21.html.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	558	An ARF (Annual Retirement Fund) is an alternative to a retirement annuity allowing certain individuals considerable flexibility and freedom in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans. The purpose of the ARF is to provide an income stream in retirement and, in common with annuity income, draw-downs from ARFs are subject to taxation at the ARF owner's marginal rate of income tax. This was always the intention.The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an ARF on 31 December each year with the notional amount taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate. The level of imputed distribution at 3% is not excessive, especially since ARFs are supposed to provide an income stream in retirement for their owners and generous tax relief is provided on the contributions to, and growth of, pension funds from which ARFs are funded. It is not unreasonable that there has to be an expectation that the benefits from these funds will be subject to tax at some point. Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for that year.The notional drawdown was introduced because an internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 (which was published in 2006) found that the ARF option was largely not being used as intended, to fund an income stream in retirement, but instead was being used to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term. The imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage the use of ARFs as intended.As a transitional measure, the 3% rate is being phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% in 2009 and each subsequent year. The new regime applies to ARF's created on or after 6 April 2000 where the ARF holder is 60 years of age or over for the whole of a tax year. This provision does not impact on Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs).  Given the rationale for the introduction of the measure, I have no plans at this time to make changes to the imputed distribution arrangements for ARFs.

In the period since September, I have, along with my Department, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), worked with the covered financial institutions to examine all options to maintain stability and the proper functioning of the banking system.This process has been comprehensive and structured, addressing such issues as the business plans of the banks, potential private investment, financial market expectations, and the role of the banks in supporting the real economy.  In addition, my Department and I have, as the Deputy would expect, spoken with very many institutions, organisations, advisers, potential investors, unions, members of the Oireachtas and private individuals.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	561	In its decisions of 28th November and 14th December 2008, the Government decided to support a recapitalisation programme for credit institutions in Ireland of up to €10 billion. You will be aware that on 21 December, I announced specific proposals in relation to the three major financial institutions. The Deputy will also be aware that we are in discussions with certain other institutions about their future capital needs.The Government's actions in response to the international financial crisis generally have been guided by two clear principles; the State will not let any systemically relevant financial institution fail and secondly, any State involvement in financial institutions will protect taxpayer's interests and have regard to legal and EU implications.In deciding to support specific recapitalisation proposals for certain banks here, the Government had regard to a number of factors including the systemic importance of the institution. The Government also had regard to the institution's relative capital strength following a shift in market expectations with regard to the level of capital banks should hold, and any alternatives available to the institution. The recapitalisation proposals have the specific objective of ensuring that the financial system in Ireland meets the everyday financial needs of individuals, businesses and the overall economy. Accordingly, institutions participating in the recapitalisation scheme are required to comply with a credit package that addresses, among other things, support for small to medium businesses and mortgage holders.With regard to the proposals announced for Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank, I have recently reiterated that the Government sees Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank as central to the Irish financial system and essential to the proper functioning of the economy. The Government wishes to ensure that both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank remain as independent banks and has re-affirmed that it is proceeding with the planned recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank on this basis.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are also in discussions with certain other institutions about their future capital needs, if any. We will be prioritising these discussions with a view to reaching an early conclusion.

The importance of having a regulatory system that provides financial stability and fosters probity has become all the more clear to us now in a time of severe financial dislocation, both nationally and internationally.  I have already acknowledged that there were shortcomings in the financial regulation oversight of our banks, not least in the case of the concealment of loans to former directors of Anglo Irish Bank, which has done serious damage not only to the Bank concerned but to Irish banking generally.  A better form of regulation is now required with a greater degree of focus on areas such as risk management, compliance, liquidity management and general control processes.There are a number of reviews under way within the Financial Regulator with a view to identifying any shortcomings in the Financial Regulator's strategic regulatory approach, its structures and its capacity to respond.  I await with interest the outcomes of these reviews and will be working with the Regulatory Authority to bring about improvements in our system of financial regulation.  As the Deputy will appreciate, steps have already been taken in that regard in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme and, as a result of this, the oversight of the banks concerned has been greatly intensified.The new regulatory framework in Ireland must also have regard to EU and international developments in the global financial regulatory framework.  In relation to the EU, there are a number of proposals being developed for adoption this year, including improvements to the Capital Requirements Directive to further strengthen the existing banking prudential framework for risk management.  Furthermore, the role and mandates of national regulators has been the subject of in-depth consideration by the ECOFIN Council.  Common reporting standards for financial institutions are being introduced to enable greater EU wide consistency in supervision.  Proposals will be introduced this year following the report of the de Larosiére Group, on ensuring prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight, early warning mechanisms and crisis management.  An initial report on this matter is due to be submitted to the Spring European Council and any reform of our Financial Regulator's structures will be consistent with EU developments.

However, most of these regulatory functions were allocated to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority upon its establishment and, at that time, it was also given new functions relating to the promotion of consumer interests.The Financial Regulator, arising from certain identified shortcomings, is conducting reviews of its business processes and procedures and its overall strategic approach.  I will consider the outcome of these reviews and if I consider that a change in legislation is required, I will bring proposals to Government and the Oireachtas for consideration.  Any such proposals would also take account of any changes at EU level.In relation to the wider EU framework, there are a number of proposals being developed which are due for adoption this year.  These include improvements to the Capital Requirements Directive to further strengthen the existing prudential framework for risk management and amendments to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive to improve coverage levels and payout periods.  I will ensure that Ireland will introduce the required amendments to Irish law as timely as possible in order to transpose the necessary changes in these areas within the required timeframe.

Persons in receipt of a full medical card are specifically exempt from the income levy.The income levy is payable on gross income, up to a ceiling of €100,100 at a rate of 1 per cent, with a rate of 2 per cent applying to income in excess of that ceiling  but not greater than €250,120, and a rate of 3 per cent applying on the balance.In relation to the self-employed, the income levy is calculated by applying the appropriate percentage to the gross income, after deduction of only those expenses directly associated with the performance of the trade, i.e. in accordance with the normal principles of commercial accounting.  No deduction is allowed for capital allowances or personal pension contributions.

A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans — Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) — by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. The latest full historical data available in this regard is in respect of the tax year 2005.There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures. However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20 per cent in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be  about €500 million. The full year yield from abolishing the tax relief is estimated at over €1 billion.As highlighted in the "Green Paper on Pensions", where tax relief arrangements are of such significance, as in this instance, the removal of the reliefs would represent a fundamental adjustment to the current balance of the tax system and would have very significant implications in terms, among other things, of the economic and behavioural impacts which would ensue. These impacts would be difficult to model in advance. For these reasons, the real informational content of these costings of tax reliefs is limited and should be treated with some caution.

Voted current expenditure is divided by Department based on the current allocation of Ministerial responsibilities. Non-Voted expenditure is predominantly made up of interest on the National Debt and contributions to the EU budget.  The gross Voted expenditure figures between 1997 and 2007 are taken from the Appropriation Account for the relevant years, while non-Voted current expenditure is derived from the appropriate Finance Accounts for the relevant years. GDP and GNI figures for these years are taken from the National Income and Expenditure Account, published by the Central Statistics Office.As a final gross Voted expenditure breakdown has not yet been published for 2008, the figures used are forecast outturns published in Budget 2009.

The figures provided are on a Revenue Net Receipts basis, which differ from Exchequer receipts due to timing and accounting issues.  The Deputy should note that the figures for 2008 are provisional at this stage and are liable to some slight revision.  VRT is a component of excise duty receipts.  Since 2003, VRT has ranged between 17.3 per cent and 23.4 per cent of overall excise duty receipts.In the recent Addendum to the Irish Stability Programme Update, aggregate tax forecasts for 2009 and the following years were set out.  It is now expected that tax revenue for 2009 will decline by 9¼ per cent, reflecting the weak economic climate that exists.  Tax revenue of €36.9 billion and €38.4 billion are forecast for 2010 and 2011.  As is customary, monthly profiles by tax-head, including excise duties, will be published shortly.  However, these are not currently available.199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008 (Prov)€m€m€m€m€m€m€m€m€m€m€m€mJAN34.350.847.160.743.342.150.239.249.054.067.6213.5FEB72.173.6109.7160.6146.1148.0162.2183.9231.3280.3311.5196.6MAR56.363.494.6128.9103.6106.2102.8120.6145.3173.9184.8155.7APR50.062.084.8120.995.081.292.6119.2139.6159.0176.7112.8MAY43.959.071.498.279.178.976.288.8112.2120.4130.989.4JUN45.556.069.7102.775.776.171.489.4105.9115.5153.784.1JUL42.056.267.885.961.558.461.376.290.2103.0100.880.4AUG39.850.659.671.452.158.763.265.976.681.380.760.7SEP57.272.986.5100.784.791.584.794.6119.9115.5113.871.1OCT20.827.234.032.118.620.621.927.334.542.436.418.4NOV24.324.927.025.517.819.219.523.727.927.429.918.3DEC16.518.518.913.710.511.713.617.216.414.719.46.4Total502.6615.1771.11,001.3788.0792.6819.4946.01,148.81,287.41,406.11,107.2
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	574	I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that following careful consideration of the matter, they reviewed their procedures in this area and, with effect from 18 March 2008 they implemented revised arrangements for the recovery of penalties in tax settlements involving deceased persons.  When the taxpayer dies before a settlement has been agreed with Revenue, Revenue will not seek the recovery of any penalty from the deceased's personal representatives (and will discontinue proceedings for recovery of a penalty if they have been initiated).  No legislative changes were involved in these new arrangements although the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 has since provided a statutory basis for these situations.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that settlements finalised before 18 March 2008 will not be reopened by Revenue.  These negotiated settlements, made in good faith by both parties, will generally have involved unreserved letters of offer and acceptance and are considered to be binding.  I should point out that where a settlement that includes a penalty element has been agreed between Revenue and a deceased taxpayer prior to his/her death (or where a penalty has been awarded in proceedings finalised prior to the taxpayer's death), and that penalty remains unpaid or not fully paid as at the date of death, Revenue will continue to proceed against the personal representatives of the deceased for the recovery of that unpaid penalty.  There is no change to existing Revenue practice in these particular circumstances.The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied, based on legal advice, that the arrangements in place are fully compatible with the legal and constitutional requirements of this State.

A detailed guide setting out the rules is available on the Revenue Commissioners' website at www.revenue.ie.  These rules apply to all companies establishing approved profit sharing schemes.  As with all tax incentives, the rules governing approved profit sharing schemes will be examined by the Commission on Taxation, which is due to provide its report to me in September 2009.

A particular priority is to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.  Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.A mandatory requirement has been included for covered institutions participating in the guarantee scheme to confirm their compliance with the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears.  The other IBF and Irish Mortgage Council members comply with the IBF Code on a voluntary basis.  Banks participating in the Government's recapitalisation programme have agreed to take action to assist householders who are in arrears.  The banks have confirmed that those in default on their home loans will be treated with respect and that they will work with mortgage holders to ensure that repossession is truly an option of last resort.  Furthermore the recapitalised banks have also confirmed to Government that they will wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before the enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a customer's primary residence.The Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme provides short-term income support to those eligible who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments.  My Department understands that over €20 million was paid out under the scheme in 2008.  In addition, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt or in danger of getting into debt.Under the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code (CPC) which applies to home loan providers operating in the State, mortgage lenders are also required to contact the consumer as soon as they become aware that a mortgage account is in arrears irrespective of the amount of the arrears.  They must also have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.  This procedure has to include a requirement that lenders should agree a remedial action plan with a borrower as soon as they detect arrears starting to emerge and try to assist the borrower to manage his or her financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen.  The Financial Regulator is currently considering the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears.In the light of all of the above, I am satisfied that adequate safeguards are currently in place to alleviate mortgage repayment problems in Ireland.  The Government will continue to monitor the situation carefully and will of course consider the requirement for any further responses in order that the legitimate interests of mortgage holders are safeguarded.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	587	Starting in late 2005, Revenue conducted a national campaign of audit and site visits in the industry to establish the levels of tax compliance and to tackle abuse.  One of the key problems identified was the fairly common failure to operate the construction industry withholding tax, known as RCT (Relevant Contract Tax).  This tax should be operated by a principal contractor on payments to subcontractors.  RCT has been in operation since the early 1970s.  The tax provides a safety net against tax evasion by operating a withholding mechanism where there is a risk of non-compliance.  It also creates an audit trail that allows money to be paid without deduction in suitable compliant cases.  I am satisfied that RCT is an essential part of fiscal control of the construction industry.It would appear from the limited facts given in the example quoted that the person who built and sold the two houses was in the business of land development.  He was acting as a principal contractor when he engaged the builders to carry out the work as sub contractors and should therefore have operated the RCT system.  Without further facts on the specific case it is not possible to give a definitive opinion on the RCT treatment of this farmer.Some principal contractors faced with Revenue audits have argued that failure to withhold the RCT has not resulted in tax loss, as the sub-contractors in the case were fully compliant with tax law.  However, the obligation on the principal to deduct the tax stands on its own and is separate from any claim for credit, or payment of due liability by the subcontractor.I am advised by Revenue that they have proposed a mechanism that would allow the principal and sub-contractor to retrospectively adjust the tax liability between them so as to eliminate any double taxation provided the sub contractors are C2 holders.  This option has been highlighted to tax practitioners in Revenue eBrief No. 10/2007 in February, with subsequent reminders in February 2008 & January 2009, prior to the Form RCT 35 filing deadline.  Guidelines on RCT are available on www.revenue.ie under Construction Industry.  This option may be available to the taxpayer mentioned by the Deputy. If he contacts his local Revenue office, the district manager can explain to him how this mechanism might work in his case.

The legislation provides for a refund after the end of the year because it would not be possible for either the Revenue Commissioners or an employer or pension provider to know during the course of the year whether or not all of the requirements necessary for the exemption to apply have been met.  This would include knowing, for example, if the person or their spouse had turned 65 in the tax year, if they had other income sources and the aggregate income from these sources, if there had been a change in employment circumstances or if there had been a change in marital status during the year.Revenue would not be in a position to establish many of these matters until after the end of a tax year and hence the need for the legislation to provide for the exemption to apply on the basis of a person making a repayment claim after the end of the tax year.  The provision of end of year reviews for this purpose should not give rise to a significant administration cost.I understand that in the case of the personal exemption of €20,000, the Revenue Commissioners have, on an administrative basis, advised employers and pension providers that they may apply the personal exemption of €20,000 during the course of the year for those persons aged 65 years and over, irrespective of marital status, where it is clear that the person's income for the year from that employment or pension will not exceed €20,000.  Where it emerges after the end of the year that this arrangement results in an underpayment of levy Revenue will pursue recovery of the levy underpaid.

Neither do the votes of the following offices under the aegis of my Department have such an allocation:Commission for Pubic Service Appointments;Office of the Revenue Commissioners;Public Appointments Service;State Laboratory;Valuation Office;Office of Public Works;Office of the Appeals Commissioner;The Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments.Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides relief from income tax and corporation tax to the owner/occupier of an approved building in respect of certain expenditure for the repair, maintenance or restoration of that building.  In order to qualify the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government must have issued a determination that the building is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest.  This is not the same as "listed buildings" per se.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that reasonable access to the building is provided for the public.  In 2005, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 84 claimant cases at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of €3.3 million.There is also a tax relief for donations of approved buildings to the Irish Heritage Trust under Section 1003A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  As with Section 482, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government must issue a determination that the building meets the qualifying conditions set out in Section 1003A(2) of the Act.  The relief is limited to 80% of the market value of the property and is subject to a total donation ceiling of €6 million per annum.

The importance of having a regulatory system that provides financial stability and fosters probity has become all the more clear to us now in a time of severe financial dislocation, both nationally and internationally.  I have already acknowledged that there were shortcomings in the financial regulation oversight of our banks, not least in the case of the concealment of loans to former directors of Anglo Irish Bank, which has done serious damage not only to the Bank concerned but to Irish banking generally.  A better form of regulation is now required with a greater degree of focus on areas such as risk management, compliance, liquidity management and general control processes.There are a number of reviews underway within the Financial Regulator with a view to identifying any shortcomings in the Financial Regulator's strategic regulatory approach, its structures and its capacity to respond.  I await with interest the outcomes of these reviews and will be working with the Regulatory Authority to bring about improvements in our system of financial regulation.  As the Deputy will appreciate, steps have already been taken in that regard in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme and, as a result of this, the oversight of the banks concerned has been greatly intensified.The new regulatory framework in Ireland must also have regard to EU and international developments in the global financial regulatory framework.  In relation to the EU, there are a number of proposals being developed for adoption this year, including improvements to the Capital Requirements Directive to further strengthen the existing banking prudential framework for risk management.  Furthermore, the role and mandates of national regulators has been the subject of in-depth consideration by the Ecofin Council.  Common reporting standards for financial institutions are being introduced to enable greater EU wide consistency in supervision.  Proposals will be introduced this year following the report of the de Larosiére Group, on ensuring prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight, early warning mechanisms and crisis management.  An initial report on this matter is due to be submitted to the Spring European Council and any reform of our Financial Regulator's structures will be consistent with EU developments.There is already available, under the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended), a sanctions regime which allows for the imposition of sanctions on regulated financial service providers, including banks, in a variety of circumstances.  Under company law, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has extensive powers of investigation which can lead to criminal proceedings.  Policy responsibility for company law and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement falls within the remit of my colleague An Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	593	The Government took the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank after consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, which confirmed that Anglo Irish Bank remained solvent.  The Board of Anglo Irish Bank was also consulted.  In December, as part of the broader recapitalisation programme, the Government committed to reinforcing the capital position of Anglo Irish Bank, so that it remained a sound and viable institution.  At the time of the re-capitalisation announcement, I made clear that the Government's offer to Anglo represented the last step short of nationalisation for the bank.  The commitment of Government support to Anglo was designed to boost market sentiment by bolstering its capital.However, the disclosure of the unacceptable practices which took place in relation to loans to the former Chairman of Anglo caused serious reputational damage to the bank.  At the same time, overall market sentiment towards Anglo was negative.  This sentiment put pressure on Anglo's share price, with the danger of knock-on effects for the confidence of depositors.  In this context, the Government decided to introduce legislation which would take Anglo into public ownership.My advice, from all sources, has been that the viability of Anglo Irish Bank is of systemic importance to Ireland, and that letting Anglo fail would lead to very serious disruption of our financial system.  The Government's decision to take Anglo into public ownership was therefore taken to ensure financial stability, and to protect deposit-holders and the reputation of the Irish banking system.To be clear — the nationalisation of this bank does not relieve its borrowers from any of their obligations.  But it does provide reassurance to the hundreds of thousands of depositors and the many bond-holders of the bank, many of whom provide funds not just to Anglo, but to the whole Irish banking system.  The Government will ensure the continued viability of all systemic financial institutions.

This Directive comes into effect on 1 November 2009 and my Department is currently working on draft legislation to enable Ireland to apply the PSD's provisions by that date.Article 52(3) of the Directive prohibits payment service providers from preventing merchants applying a surcharge or offering a reduction for the use of a given payment instrument.  This is to ensure that the costs of efficient and inefficient payment instruments are transparent.  There is an optional provision in Article 52(3) of the Directive which allows Member States to forbid or limit the right to request such surcharges for the use of a particular payment instrument.  However, as is made clear in a Recital to the Directive, this can only be done if two conditions are satisfied, namely, that such intervention is necessary in order to encourage competition and to promote the use of efficient payment methods.My Department consulted relevant stakeholders last year on the draft text of the transposing regulation, which did not propose to avail of the PSD derogation.  There was a generally positive response in regard to the draft regulations proposed treatment of Article 52(3).In assessing the potential impact on competition of the proposal, there is the consideration that, in the event that traders were unable to reflect the cost to them of accepting payment using a particular instrument, they might choose to pass on the costs involved to all consumers, regardless of the payment instrument used, leading to a general increase in the price level.  Alternatively, they might choose not to accept payment using such an instrument, which could result in increased use of paper-based payment instruments, a development which would run counter to the Government's objective of encouraging the use of electronic payment methods.The Deputy may wish to note that work on the transposition of the Directive is ongoing in my Department and I have not yet made a final decision in relation to the draft regulation's treatment of Article 52(3).  If a substantive case can be advanced that would be likely to be legally sustainable in favour of availing of the discretion to promote competition and the use of efficient payment methods, I would of course be prepared to review the matter.

In general, there are no tuition fees payable at undergraduate level.  This is an effective subsidy to students and their parents or guardians who would otherwise have to pay some or all of the economic cost of providing such undergraduate education.In addition, where tuition fees are payable in respect of certain full-time and part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses in approved colleges, tax relief is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual.  The current maximum relief per course per academic year in respect of third level fees is €5,000 at the standard rate of tax.  Such tuition fees paid by parents on behalf of their children qualify for this tax relief.I would also point out that the Government has allocated over €277 million towards student support for 2009.  The largest component of this spending is maintenance grants.  These provisions ensure that State support in this area is directed towards those who most need it.  The introduction of additional tax relief in respect of the cost of rental accommodation for parents of college-going students would involve significant costs for the Exchequer and cannot be considered at this time.  The Commission on Taxation is scheduled to provide its report to me in September 2009.  It will not make any proposals or recommendations in advance of that.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	605	Ready, Steady Play: A National Play Policy, which was published in 2004, provides a framework for the development of public play facilities in Ireland with the overall aim of ensuring that children have access to a range of quality play opportunities to enrich their childhood.  In addition to the Play Policy, Teenspace National Recreation Policy for Young People was launched in September 2007.  The policy provides a strategic framework for the promotion of positive recreational opportunities aimed principally at young people aged 12 to 18.  The policy adopts an evidence-based approach and makes proposals to address issues which emerged from a public consultation process which was undertaken by my Office and was also informed through the findings of independent research commissioned by my Office.While the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has an overall role in supporting implementation of the play and recreation policies, actions fall to be implemented by a wide range of government departments and agencies.  The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Sports, Arts and Tourism and the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs all have schemes and programmes which support the development of appropriate facilities.  Other Departments and Agencies have schemes and programmes which also contribute to overall development of recreational opportunities more generally.In terms of the planning process for improved play and recreational facilities, the Planning and Development Act 2000 makes a number of provisions aimed at embedding improved planning of social and community and cultural requirements for communities.  The Act also expressly supports the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, crèches and other education and child care facilities.  Community facilities falling within this mandatory objective can include facilities for children's play including playgrounds, skateboard parks and other facilities, libraries and community halls.  Development contributions can also be sought by planning authorities to help pay for facilities servicing new developments such as community and other recreational amenities.  Section 48 allows for open spaces and recreational and community facilities and amenities to be provided under a development contribution scheme.Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans, published in June 2007, emphasise the objectives for the provision of public open space and recreation space, including space and places for children to play, and the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities.  While it is ultimately a matter for the members of the local authority, as planning authority in their area, to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which the scheme will apply, the emphasis on improved planning and provision is embedded in the development process.Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Through the Sports Capital Programme Government has invested considerable sums into important sporting infrastructure with allocations made of over €725 million in more than 7,340 separate sports projects since 1998.  This investment has transformed the Irish sporting landscape with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and community in the country.  Some Sports Capital Programme allocations have been made to assist grantees, in particular Local Authorities, in the provision of public play and recreation areas such as multi-use games areas and skate parks.It terms of children specific projects:the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the HSE have co-funded the development of new playgrounds or refurbishment of existing playgrounds in RAPID areas since 2004.  The 2008 Scheme has made €3m available for the development of playgrounds.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have also provided Playground Grants and Skateboard Grants Schemes between 2004 and 2006.  A Primary School Outdoor Facilities Enhancement Scheme was also funded under CLÁR programme in 2004/5.  Since the publication of the Play Policy, over €28m has been allocated to the provision of play facilities which has resulted in the development of an additional 300 play facilities throughout the country.In addition to the development of these play facilities, €600,000 has been allocated under the Playbus Measure, via dormant accounts funding, for a six local Playbus schemes.  This measure is intended to provide interventions that support the family unit, by providing play development and parenting development outreach services to children and their parents, experiencing social exclusion in disadvantaged and isolated areas.My Office is also actively working on the development of a youth café programme as set out in the Programme for Government. The National Children's Advisory Council has reported to me on this matter and further work is underway to bring a more strategic approach to existing funding arrangements, clearer standards and criteria for the development of new cafés.  I expect to launch the youth café programme in the near future.My Office is continuing to monitor, promote and support the development of play and recreational opportunities for children and young people with this wide range of stakeholders.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	607	Services for cocaine users continue to be provided as a integral part of the existing HSE addiction treatment services.  In recent times the HSE has been re-orienting its addiction services to address the needs arising from changing patterns of drug use in the population e.g. poly drug use including cocaine use, alcohol use and abuse of prescribed drugs.  Available evidence indicates that many approaches already in use in general addiction services work well with cocaine misusers.  These approaches are not specific to the treatment of a cocaine using group and are effective for problem use of other substances.In response to the emerging need for services for cocaine misusers the HSE developed an out of work hours cocaine specific clinic for the Galway area.  However, a review by the clinical team of the Galway cocaine initiative identified a lack of attendance by clients: the evening service was not used by primary cocaine users as anticipated despite rigorous advertising and promotion and calls to the service during the evening session were often poly drug users and family members looking to access an evening service.  Consequently, it was decided that the evening session should be retained to offer an out of hours service open to all referrals — including primary cocaine users — as it is envisaged that this will be a more effective use of the evening clinical sessions.  Further development of cocaine services will take on board the lessons learned from the Galway experience.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	608	As you may be aware, further to the Taoiseach's announcement in May 2008, arrangements to transfer responsibility for the Young People's Facilities & Services Fund (YPFSF) to the Office of the Minister for Youth Affairs and Children have recently been completed.  I am of the opinion that this will assist in the provision of a cohesive and comprehensive response to the needs of all young people, including those at risk of drug use.Since it was established in 1998, the Government has allocated over €150m under the Young Peoples Facilities & Services Fund (YPFSF) to assist in the development of youth facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  Approximately €66m has been provided for capital developments, which include the building, upgrading, fit-out and refurbishment of some 220 youth and community facilities in the different target areas.Over €20m in capital and current funding has transferred from the Department of Community, Rural, & Gaeltacht Affairs Vote to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  My officials, and officials from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs have been liaising over recent months to ensure a seamless transition.  I am confident that the transfer will assist in ensuring the most strategic use of this fund and other youth programmes under my overall remit.  I can assure the Deputy that my officials are liaising with the existing National Advisory Council to ensure the focus and objectives of the fund are protected and promoted in the OMCYA.At present, the Fund operates in the 14 Local Drugs Task Force areas (Dublin (12), Bray and Cork), and in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow Town.  In light of the current fiscal climate my Department is currently examining available resources in order to determine if the expansion of the Fund to the four new towns of Arklow, Athlone, Dundalk and Wexford, announced in May 2008, can take place this year in any meaningful way.  A decision on this matter will be made shortly.

While this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector including the roll out of some sections of the Youth Work Act, 2001 and actions cited in the National Youth Work Development Plan, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidating current provision.  The 2008 provision of €52.6m for Youth Affairs enabled the high level of provision achieved over recent years to be maintained with a continuing focus on consolidation of services.  It is my intention that the 2009 Youth Affairs budget of over €48m will continue to focus on supporting existing youth programmes and services for some 420,000 young people.With regard to the Youth Work Act, 2001, the National Youth Work Development Plan 2003-2007 and the development of a further Plan, sub-committees of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee (NYWAC), representative of both statutory and voluntary sectors, are currently reviewing the progress made to date in respect of both the Act and the Plan and are preparing recommendations for NYWAC to present to me regarding the next steps to be taken.  I will consider the advice of this Committee having regard to the progress already made, the needs of our young people with regard to youth work opportunities and the resources available for Youth Affairs in 2009.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I propose to take Questions Nos. 320, 330, 333, 335, 344, 351, 354, 381, 382, 442, 451, 454 and 536 together.As the Deputies will be aware, the Adoption Bill, 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, was published on Friday 23rd January.  Under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have also ratified the Hague Convention, and countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement which meets Hague standards.While it is true to say that our current Agreement with Vietnam is based on Hague principles, as part of the preparations for our new legislation we need to ensure that our Agreement reflects the Hague Convention as comprehensively as possible.  A new Agreement allows the opportunity to elaborate and strengthen some existing provisions to meet the standards which it is anticipated will be set in draft legislation.  There have been considerable developments in intercountry adoption in Vietnam since the Agreement was signed 5 years ago.  This progress also needs to be reflected in any new Agreement.There is a clause in the current Agreement which states that the Agreement will be automatically extended for another 5 year term unless one State notifies the other State to the contrary.  Because of the changes to our adoption legislation, the Agreement cannot ‘roll over' in its present form for another 5 years.  As a result, the Irish Government was obliged to formally notify Vietnam that there can be no automatic renewal of the Agreement when the five year term expires on 1 May, 2009.I am aware of the concerns of those parents who have already adopted and those who hope to adopt from Vietnam in the future.  I would like to assure the Deputy that officials from my Office and the Adoption Board have been continuously monitoring the situation and liaising closely with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Hanoi over recent months.  In November, a senior official from my Office led a delegation to Vietnam accompanied by the Chairman and CEO of the Adoption Board.  While the purpose of this visit was to commence discussions with the Vietnamese Authorities on the possible renegotiation of the Agreement, the delegation also availed of the opportunity to meet with officials from various embassies and with UNICEF to discuss the their views on intercountry adoption from Vietnam.On foot of this visit to Vietnam, the Irish Government issued a formal request to the Vietnamese Authorities stating that we wish to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new Agreement to follow on from the existing Agreement.  The Vietnamese Authorities have responded positively to Ireland's request.Ireland offered to provide the Vietnamese Authorities with the text of a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations.  An initial draft was prepared by my officials and was submitted to colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office for their consideration in December 2008.At present, the text of the draft is being finalised following the receipt of legal advices.  Once the text of the draft has been agreed between the OMCYA, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office it will be forwarded to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration.  It is anticipated that we will be in a position to forward this draft to Vietnam shortly.The work to prepare for and advise the Government on this issue and the implementation of Government's decisions is being given the highest priority.  These are complex matters which require careful consideration.  At all times, the Minister and the Government, and officials advising them, are guided by the need to respect and protect the best interests and rights of the child.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I propose to take Questions Nos. 321 and 322 together.The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) implements national food safety policy.  This allows the Department of Health & Children and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to concentrate on the formulation of national policy and to represent Ireland's interests at international level.  The FSAI will soon be amalgamated with the Irish Medicines Board and the Office of Tobacco Control to form a new Public Health and Medicines Safety Authority.The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is broadly responsible for food safety policy as it relates to production.  That Department also has responsibility for the enforcement of food safety legislation under a service contract with the FSAI.  The Department of Health and Children has broad responsibility for food safety policy in the retail and catering service sector.This arrangement worked well during this incident, since both Departments bring different areas of expertise to food safety; the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a wealth of knowledge in relation to agricultural production, both on the farm and in the factory.  The Department of Health and Children primarily focuses on the public health dimension.During the recent pork recall, all three bodies worked closely together to ensure that both the public health and industry perspectives were fully considered.  From an industry perspective, while the recall was costly, it showed the world that we were serious about food safety and helped to protect the hard-won reputation of Irish food.  This action will be of long-term benefit to the Irish food industry.  From a public health perspective, the swift actions and scale of the response by the Irish Authorities were welcomed by a number of international commentators.The importance of a quick response cannot be understated since, while the health risks for people exposed, in the short term, to dioxins did not provide cause for concern, the potential effects of continued high cumulative exposure over time might have.  The high levels of dioxins, which were between 80 and 200 times the legal limit, found in the pork products necessitated this course of action.  Long-term chronic exposure to dioxins can result in a number of different cancers.The existing food safety traceability system enabled the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food to identify immediately, from positive samples at slaughter, a farm and a feed supplier and all the customers of that feed supplier.  Notwithstanding this however, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food has indicated that it is to examine the potential to further improve pork traceability.  My Department will provide any assistance required in this regard.

That legislation is implemented by the Health Service Executive, under a Service Contract Agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  This ensures that consumers in Ireland are protected by the harmonised EU rules on the sale of food supplements, in particular the labelling of food supplements and chemical form of vitamins and minerals they contain.  One of the objectives of the Food Supplements Directive (2002/46/EC) was to make provision for the European Commission to determine maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.  This matter remains under consideration at European Commission level.The European Commission published a Discussion Paper on determining maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in June 2006.  The Irish response to this Discussion Paper gave Ireland's view that the Commission should proceed on a cautious basis, setting maximum limits for as many vitamins and minerals as possible.  It was considered vital that the safety of the general population and the needs of particular subgroups such as pregnant women, children, older people and those on various specialist diets be taken into account in formulating the position on this issue.Officials from both my Department and the FSAI are involved in ongoing discussions at European level on the development of a methodology under which maximum safe levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will be set.  Those discussions will permit the European Commission and Member States to further develop its thinking on this issue.While the Irish position remains one of precaution for the reasons set out above, we will take account of Irish consumers' views and those of industry in adopting a position during those discussions.  Our final position will be based on the above and on the scientific evidence presented to Member States during the discussions.

This Directive did not cover the activities of doctors in training.  In June 2000 the European Parliament and Council adopted Directive 2000/34/EC which amended Council Directive 93/104/EC and brought the activities of doctors in training within its scope.  This Directive was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004 (S.I. No. 494 of 2004).

Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.  There is significant international and national evidence that acute complex health care, particularly for emergency medicine, complex surgical services and critical care should be provided in hospitals which are suitably staffed and equipped and which undertake sufficient volumes of such activity, in order to maximise clinical outcomes and ensure safe services.  At the same time there is a significant range of less complex care which can continue to be provided safely in smaller hospitals.Reorganisation of services must of course occur in consultation with the key stakeholders and on an incremental basis.  I believe that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time.  This approach will, I am confident, produce the best outcome for patients.  The Health Service Executive has recently published the report which it commissioned from Horwath Consultants in association with Teamwork Management Services to examine the arrangements for the provision of acute hospital services in the Mid-West with a view to identifying the best configuration of such services in the region.The Executive has indicated that certain changes to the present arrangements for the provision of some acute services must be made, in the interests of patient safety and also to make best use of the clinical resources available within the region.  Detailed plans are currently being formulated by the HSE in relation to emergency care, critical care and surgical services.  I have asked the HSE to furnish the Deputies with more detailed information on the changes proposed.I have asked the HSE, in the context of the development of its capital plan, to consider the requirements of the Mid-West arising from the planned reconfiguration of services in the region.  The HSE has submitted a draft capital plan which sets out its proposed short- and long-term priorities in the context of funding notified as part of Budget 2009 and changes in construction costs.  Consultation on the draft capital plan is ongoing between the HSE and my Department.  The Executive is currently engaged in providing additional clarification on its proposed capital developments.  I have agreed to meet shortly with Oireachtas members and a delegation from Clare County Council to discuss the proposals being drawn up by the HSE.

They are then forwarded to my Office for consideration and approval following which a further period of time is generally required before a project comes to contract and completes drawdown of the grant funding.  In effect, projects which are processed in 2009 would be expected to give rise to capital expenditure 2010 and 2011.As the Deputy will be aware, a Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, chaired by Mr. Colm McCarthy, has been established to examine and make recommendations for the reduction of gross expenditure programmes under all headings and public service numbers in each Department.  As the outcome of this process could impact on the level of capital expenditure available to the NCIP during 2010 and subsequent years, a decision regarding the timeframe for the next round of capital grant applications, under the programme has been deferred until the recommendations of the Group are known.  This decision was communicated to the CCCs in December 2008.  The Committees were also advised that this does not affect the position in regard to smaller scale capital grant schemes which are administered directly by them and in respect of which they have received specific funding allocations in 2009.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	631	General labelling is currently governed by Directive 2000/13/EC, which makes compulsory the indication of particulars of the place of origin or provenance only where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff.  Under Article 18 of the Directive, national provisions can only be justified on grounds of the protection of public health, the prevention of fraud or unfair competition, and protection of property rights and indications of provenance.The member state, when attempting to introduce regulations in this area, must receive a positive opinion from the European Commission.  During 2008, the Department of Health and Children, on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, proposed to introduce national legislation making mandatory country of origin labelling on poultry.  This received a negative response from the European Commission, on the grounds that it was contrary to the principle of harmonisation and would create a disproportionate obstacle to the free movement of goods within the EU if implemented.In the Commission's proposal on the provision of food information to the consumer, issued in January 2008, similar provisions to those outlined in Directive 2000/13/EC are proposed.  In addition, however, allowance is made for a voluntary national measure, with mandatory requirements.  Where a Food Business Operator chooses to use country of origin labelling, Article 35 of the proposal states that "where the country of origin or the place of provenance of the food is not the same as the one of its primary ingredient(s), the country of origin or place of provenance of those ingredient(s) shall also be given".  It adds that, "for meat, other than beef and veal, the indication on the country of origin or place of provenance may be given as a single place only where animals have been born, reared and slaughtered in the same country or place.  In other cases information on each of the different places of birth, rearing and slaughter shall be given."Ireland submitted its position paper on the Food Information proposal on 5 November 2008.  In this proposal, Ireland pressed for mandatory country of origin labelling for all foodstuffs.  Ireland suggested that, for meat, information be also given regarding the country of birth, rearing and slaughter (where different from the country of origin).  The Department of Health and Children will continue to pursue this issue through the EU Working Group charged with developing the proposal.  It is expected that the proposal will not be finalised until at least late 2009.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The primary remit of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is to offer surgical procedures to public patients who have been waiting longest for surgery.  Once a person is longer than three months waiting, he or she may be eligible for treatment through the Fund.  The NTPF currently maintains a particular focus on those persons who are waiting longer than 12 months for surgical procedures.  Depending on progress made in individual hospitals, patients who have been waiting for six months and, in some cases, three months, are currently being offered treatment.At the beginning of 2008, there were 960 patients waiting over 12 months for surgery in Letterkenny General Hospital.  In view of this excessively high number, the NTPF last year requested the hospital to refer those persons waiting longest to the Fund first.  The latest returns from Letterkenny Hospital (December 2008) to the NTPF show that there are still approximately 200 waiting over 12 months for surgery.  I welcome this significant progress and look forward to the elimination of such excessive waiting times during 2009.In relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy, the child in question has been on the Letterkenny General Hospital waiting list since June 2008.  I understand that, subsequent to the child's parents contacting the NTPF, the Fund has arranged a pre-operative review for him for 5 February 2009 in the North West Independent Hospital, Derry.

#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	635	Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, individuals who require long-term residential care will contribute a maximum of 80% of their net assessable income whether for public or private nursing home care.  In calculating an individual's net assessable income, it is proposed that account can be taken of specified items of expenditure.Depending on the amount of a person's assessable income, there may also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person's assets in excess of the asset disregard per annum.  The asset disregard is €36,000 for an individual or €72,000 for a couple.  The State will meet the balance of cost thereafter in public or private nursing homes and an individual's family and/or friends will not have to contribute towards the cost of their care.  An individual can choose any nursing home subject to a) its ability to meet their care needs and b) availability.Contributions based on Irish land-based assets may be deferred for the duration of a person's lifetime and repaid from their estate.  If an individual opts to defer this portion of the contribution, the Revenue Commissioners will collect it upon settlement of their estate.  However, this deferred contribution element of the scheme is voluntary.  Individuals may choose to pay as they go in which case no money would be repayable from their estate.Where the contribution is based on the principal private residence, it will be capped at a maximum of 15%, or 7.5% in the case of one spouse going into long-term residential care while the other remains in the home.  This means that after three years in care, an individual will not be liable for any further deferred contribution based on the principal residence.  Where a spouse or certain dependants are living in the principal residence, the contribution may be further deferred until after the death of that spouse or dependant, or until such time as a person previously qualifying as a dependant ceases to qualify as such.Finally, the new scheme will not be limited to persons over the age of 65.  Any person who enters long-term residential care in a nursing home will be able to apply to avail of the scheme.

However, there is a drug which contains the ingredient of the drug mentioned, which is reimbursable under the schemes.The specific drug mentioned by the Deputy is only authorised as a medicinal product in Ireland as an additional therapy, within a comprehensive medical and psychological treatment programme, for detoxified patients who have been opioid-dependent.  It is not authorised in Ireland or member states of the European Union for the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis.  An application for a clinical trial would have to be submitted by the manufacturer or a clinician to the Irish Medicines Board with the relevant supporting document.  The trial would have to receive ethics approval and be supervised by a consultant neurologist.

The current legal position in Ireland in relation to cannabis is that it is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  All Schedule 1 substances are substances which are considered as having no medicinal use and the manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis is unlawful except for the purposes of research.My Department is aware that claims have been made in respect of cannabis and its possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis and glaucoma.  As the law currently stands, however, it would not be possible for a cannabis extract to be licensed here for medicinal use or for a doctor to prescribe it.  There are no exemptions or exceptions applicable.  Any person entering the country with medicinal cannabis could be charged under the Misuse of Drugs Act with unauthorised possession and I do not intend to change the law in this regard.The issue of whether Article 75 of the Schengen Agreement, which allows travellers to carry narcotic drugs and/or psychotropic substances for the purposes of medical treatment between Member States, has been ratified by Ireland is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	642	I propose to take Questions Nos. 359 and 363 together.The Medical Council is the statutory body charged with responsibility for the registration of medical practitioners and the regulation of their activities.  When a medical practitioner has been erased in another jurisdiction, the Medical Council does not have the power to automatically erase that practitioner's name from the register without holding an inquiry carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  This is a constitutional matter which has previously been ruled on by the Supreme Court.  Therefore, it is possible for a medical practitioner, whose name has been removed from the General Medical Council's register in the UK, to remain on the Medical Council's register in Ireland.   Circumstances where such a situation could occur would include the following:(i) where the circumstances leading to a doctor's removal from the UK register have yet to be investigated by the Medical Council in Ireland;(ii) where the circumstances leading to a doctor's removal from the UK register could not be properly investigated by the Medical Council in Ireland as a result of UK-based witnesses' refusal to participate in an inquiry;(iii) where, following a statutory inquiry, the Medical Council made a decision not to apply to the High Court to have that doctor's name erased having been unable to prove the case; or(iv) where the High Court refused to confirm the Medical Council's decision to erase the doctor's name.   The occurrence of this situation, however, is rare.The Medical Council has established a system of information exchange with the UK General Medical Council whereby the relevant information arising from the outcome of all disciplinary procedures affecting a registered medical practitioner's registration, in either jurisdiction, is exchanged, unless, in the case of the Medical Council, it is prevented from doing so by the High Court.  The Council is notified of a decision when a medical practitioner has been erased from the register by the General Medical Council in the UK.  The Council then considers the matter in accordance with the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.

No capital outlay is required as the beds in the public hospitals are already in place, having been funded by the Exchequer.  The Board of the HSE approved successful bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at six hospital sites.  Progress made in relation to each of these sites is set out in the following table:HospitalStatus (January 2009)Beaumont HospitalProject Agreement signed.

Work is being undertaken to finalise the Invitation to Tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital.As regards funding, each successful bidder has to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant Project Agreement.  It is certainly the case that the funding environment has changed radically in the last six months, in relation to both public and private sectors.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with this.  The successful bidders are working on the details of contractual terms with banks and other arrangers of finance in the very difficult and changed credit environment.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders with the goal of achieving new public acute bed capacity at value for money to the State.

What is required in a given situation falls to be determined on the basis of the facts of an individual case.  In medical emergencies, for example, urgent treatment may be provided to a child in the absence of express consents where it is necessary to save the life of the child.  The age of the child is also relevant with this issue being provided for in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 for children over 16 years.I have contacted the Health Service Executive in this regard and I understand that the Executive has developed guidelines entitled "Procedure for obtaining consent for non emergency treatment/services from parents of children and young people under the age of 18 years".  These guidelines give the necessary clarity in relation to this matter and I shall arrange for a copy to be forwarded to the Deputies as soon as possible.  I understand from the HSE that these guidelines will be available on the HSE website in the near future.  If the Deputies are aware of any particular case where the issue of medical consent needs to be clarified then the individual concerned should contact his/her Local Health Office in this regard.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	654	Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	655	The HSE made considerable progress since 2006 in improving the delivery of services in Emergency Departments.  The vast majority of hospitals were fully or substantially compliant with the 12 hour maximum waiting time target for those requiring admission.  However, considerable pressures have been experienced since the beginning of January in Emergency Departments across the country and this has been reflected in an increase in the waiting times for patients.  The difficulties are attributed to a number of factors, including the influenza and norovirus outbreaks.The HSE is working closely with all hospitals, including Beaumont Hospital, in managing these pressures and in ensuring that waiting times for all patients attending Emergency Departments are kept to a minimum.I am determined that the improvements made over the last two years in managing activity in our Emergency Departments are sustained and in this context, I have asked the HSE to set a revised maximum waiting time target this year of no more than six hours from registration to admission or discharge for all patients attending Emergency Departments, and not just for those patients who require admission.  The HSE is also introducing a measurement system during 2009 which will record the total waiting time for all patients attending Emergency Departments.My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy on the specific issues raised regarding Beaumont Hospital.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I propose to take Questions Nos. 387, 388 and 507 together.There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements have been made in several regions to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.  My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.I have been advised by the HSE that, subject to consultation with IMPACT on non-fee aspects, which process is now nearing completion, it will be contacting chiropodists offering them interim contracts to provide services and advising them of the revised fees payable for such services.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the Deputy advised when this has been accomplished.The HSE has also stated that its long term intention is to replace the interim contract with a substantive contract for the provision of chiropody services and that this will be progressed in line with national policy as it applies to private contractors.

In order to facilitate this, a seminar was held last year at which the Minister for Health and Children spoke and which drew together clinicians who currently provide services to this patient group.  It has been agreed by those conducting the review that, owing to the relatively small number of cases of this condition, it would be inappropriate to develop the complex surgical services required in this country.  With regard to clinical, psychological and psychiatric services, these are available in Ireland and can provide a professional assessment prior to any medical or surgical intervention.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	674	The development of robust, responsive and appropriate child welfare and protection services is a priority for both myself as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Government.  Following my appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I initiated and chair regular meetings with senior officials from the Health Service Executive so as to drive reform and modernisation of services for children and families.Recent years have seen a period of major investment in child care and family support services to enable an appropriate response to child welfare concerns with over €240 million of Government funds added to the annual investment in child care services since 1997.  The core principle underpinning the allocation of this additional funding is to provide children and young people with the appropriate care and to provide services to protect them, as far as possible, from all forms of harm.  The Health Service Executive continues to develop new services for children at risk, aimed at preventing them entering long term care and enabling them to return to their family, if appropriate and in the child's best interest."The Agenda for Children's Services" is the new overarching policy document of my Office and was launched in December 2007.  The Agenda, with its clear renewed emphasis on family support coupled with reflective questions to enable service provider self evaluation, represents the fundamental change now underway on how Government policy in relation to children is formulated and delivered.  It has been developed drawing on research and best practice at home and internationally.  It requires an outcome focus and integrated service delivery in line with the recommendations of the OECD review of the Irish public service.  To help implement the policies and principles in the Agenda, at the instigation of my Office, the Executive is well advanced in the process of developing a Children and Families services policy.  This is vital to effective reform and rebalancing of children's services.  My Office is involved in the development of this policy working in partnership with the Health Service Executive.One of the key messages of the Children First National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children is that responsibility for protecting children must be shared by all adults.  Anyone who works with, has responsibility for, or comes into contact with, children should be aware of the signs of abuse, be alert to the possibility of abuse, and be familiar with the basic procedures to report their concerns.  I am confident that my Office and the Health Service Executive will bring about significantly improved and integrated child welfare and protection services for all children who need such services.

There is no statutory provision for charging public patients for outpatient services, with the exception of the A&E charge.  The A&E charge is not applicable, inter alia, where the patient has a referral letter from their general practitioner.When a patient opts to see a consultant in a private capacity, they are deemed to be private to all consultants engaged in the provision of outpatient services in relation to that particular consultation, and any fees charged are a private contractual arrangement between the patient and the consultants.  Neither my Department nor the Health Service Executive (HSE) has any responsibility for such fees.  Nevertheless, I have arranged to have your correspondence forwarded to the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to clarify the matter and they will reply to you directly.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	683	My Department and the Health Service Executive published the National Pandemic Influenza Plan in 2007. The purpose of the plan is to limit the effects of a potential pandemic and to inform the public about pandemic influenza, explain what the Government and Health Services are doing to prepare for a possible pandemic, and give information on what members of the public need to do if there is a pandemic. The plan will continue to be updated on a regular basis to reflect the most up to date advice of the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group and international developments.The health service response to the threat of an influenza pandemic is based on eight core elements: Communications Strategy, Telephone Hotline, Responsibilities of the Public, Surveillance, Antiviral Drugs, Pandemic Vaccine, Reorganisation of Health Services and Essential Supplies.In November 2007, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued its report into its inspection of Ireland's preparedness for a pandemic. The ECDC report highlights areas where significant progress has been made and also points out where further work is needed. The Report highlights, in particular, the need to continue work on developing a "whole of Government" approach to pandemic flu planning.  Officials of my Department are currently engaged in high level bilateral discussions with all relevant Departments and agencies with a view to advancing this.

#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	685	As the Deputy is aware, the Minister published the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008 on the 9th October and introduced it at Second Stage in the Dáil in November.  It is her intention to bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible with a view to implementing the scheme in 2009.  Only after the legislation has been enacted, and the scheme commenced, will the Health Service Executive be in a position to consider applications under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.Budget 2009 provided €55 million for the implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme this year. This brings the total funding in the subhead for long-term residential care in 2009 to €909 million.  The Bill provides that the Minister may make Regulations on various matters. Where necessary, it is intended that Regulations will be made as soon as possible in tandem with the commencement of the scheme.Under the new scheme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) will negotiate prices for long-term care with private nursing home owners on behalf of the State. Where nursing homes agree prices for the purposes of the scheme with the NTPF, the NTPF will recommend the homes to the Health Service Executive for inclusion on the list of nursing homes ‘approved' for the scheme. A person availing of the scheme can then choose any approved private nursing home or public nursing home on the list subject to availability and the suitability of the home to meet their care needs.In order to become approved for the purposes of the scheme, a private nursing home must:(a) be registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 at present and, in the future, under the Health Act 2007 (once the relevant sections are commenced),(b) have agreed a price for the purposes of the scheme with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF),(c) hold a valid tax clearance certificate.The NTPF's negotiating role under the scheme will be an ongoing one.  The price agreed with private nursing homes for the purposes of the scheme will naturally be subject to periodic re-negotiation to take account of inflation and other developments.  The NTPF will commence its role under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme as soon as the legislation has been passed and the relevant section of the Act commenced.In conclusion, the timeframe for commencement of the scheme is contingent upon the passage of the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas and the successful negotiation by the National Treatment Purchase Fund of agreed prices for the scheme. Within this context, it is not possible to be specific about a timeframe at this stage. However, it is anticipated that the Scheme will commence during the second half of 2009.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I have identified the development of neurology services as a priority in recent years.  Additional revenue funding of €7m was allocated to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2006 and 2007 for the development of services in the area of neurosciences, which comprises neurology, neurophysiology and neurosurgery.  This investment has helped to increase the number of approved consultant neurology posts which now stands at 24 compared with 14 in 2003.  Additional revenue funding of €850,000 has been included in the HSE's 2009 National Service Plan to support the further development of neurosciences, including neurology.The creation and funding of further consultant posts will be driven by service priorities, as reflected in the HSE's Annual Service Plan, and the policy of achieving a better balance between the numbers of consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors. There is to be a significant reduction in the number of Non Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) employed in each of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. This would generate savings that would be used to fund the recruitment of additional consultants. Government policy is to have a consultant-delivered, rather than a consultant-led service. The new consultant contract is designed to support this and, as in many areas of our health services, service improvements will depend to a much greater extent on mobilising and re-configuring existing resources than on additional funds.My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy on the specific issues raised.

Within the cardiovascular group, the proportion of deaths due to coronary heart disease and stroke declined from 22% (7,059 deaths) and 9% (2,807 deaths) in 1999 to 19% (5,417 deaths) and 7% (2,085 deaths) in 2004 respectively.The Health Service Executive (HSE) has indicated that there are now acute stroke units in six hospitals, namely the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, St James's Hospital, Dublin; South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel; Our Lady's Hospital, Navan; Sligo General Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Galway. A further two hospitals, St Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny and Connolly Hospital, Dublin are building or refurbishing stroke units. The HSE is evaluating its current stroke services and has identified a number of hospitals where stroke services could be further developed.The National Audit of Stroke Care was published in April 2008 by the Irish Heart Foundation, with the support of my Department. In September 2007, I established a Cardiovascular Health Policy Group to advise on how to prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and stroke and improve services for individuals affected by these conditions. The Policy Group has, in the course of its work, considered the findings of the Audit and is addressing the issues, including prevention in the primary care setting, rapid access to diagnostic services, the configuration of stroke services, including stroke units, the provision of thrombolysis as well as models of rehabilitation and discharge planning.  The group is expected to report shortly.

One of the issues raised was the position regarding five individuals claiming exposure to thalidomide, who were not included in the 1975 Compensation Scheme for thalidomide victims.  The Minister decided to refer the five individuals to an independent, recognised international expert, Dr. Peter Kohler of Stockholm in Sweden, who treats victims of thalidomide, for a clinical assessment of their condition.Having considered all the evidence before him, Dr. Kohler determined that one of the five individuals is a victim of thalidomide exposure.  While the issue of comparable compensation for that individual is under consideration, the Department will not be revisiting any further claims in relation to thalidomide.  The Department has been in contact with all five individuals regarding the outcome of their assessment.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	712	The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive are involved in ongoing discussions with the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) regarding its proposals for the development of a newly expanded hospital on the current hospital site.  In relation to the proposed new National Rehabilitation Hospital, planning permission has been granted for the development of a 235 bed facility at the NRH site.  Tenders from selected contractors have been received by the hospital.There is a need to ensure that the proposed development will be in keeping with any future policy direction determined by the Working Group that is currently developing a National Policy/Strategy for the provision of Rehabilitation Services. The Working Group consists of key stakeholders and experts in the field of rehabilitation. Its terms of reference include the development of an appropriate policy framework for rehabilitation and a preferred model of care for the provision of rehabilitation services. It is due to report later this year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Clearly, the current fiscal position demands the most careful control of public expenditure and I am strongly of the view that account needs to be taken of all emerging potential cost pressures and also opportunities for efficiencies.  I am very conscious of the need to make savings where possible without impacting on service levels and have consistently communicated this need to the HSE.  As part of a multi-annual approach to value for money announced by me in the context of the Budget, a range of value for money measures has been outlined in the HSE Service Plan 2009, of which legal services procurement is just one element.  I understand that the tender process referred to by the Deputy is a significant part of the HSE strategy to achieve savings in legal costs.Operational responsibility for the management of value for money and procurement is a matter for the Health Service Executive as funding for its support services has been provided for as part of its overall Vote.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have a more detailed reply issued directly to the Deputy on the specific matter raised.

Although an additional €50m was allocated under the Multi-Annual Investment Programme (MAIP) in Budget 2008, the commencement of the planned developments was delayed and the actual cost incurred in respect of these developments in 2008 was €33m.  However, the full-year cost of these services in 2009 will be €50m and this is provided for in the HSE's 2009 Service Plan.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	716	The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, ‘A Vision for Change' provides a framework for action to develop modern, high quality mental health services over a seven to ten year period.  Some 80% of the recommendations of the Report are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  In January 2008, the HSE published an interim implementation plan for ‘A Vision for Change' and progress was made in advancing the plan's key priorities  The priorities identified included:Catchment Area Definition and Clarification;Modernisation of the Mental Health Infrastructure;Community Based Mental Health Teams;Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams;Mental Health Services for People with Intellectual Disability;Mental Health Information Systems.A more detailed implementation plan has been prepared by the HSE and will be completed following finalisation of their new structures.Funding has been provided in 2009 for an 35 additional therapist posts for the child and adolescent mental health service.  Once-off funding of €1.75 million is also being provided in 2009 for suicide prevention initiatives and mental health projects supporting service users and carers.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I take it that in referring to the ‘Health Service Guidelines on the Protection of Children', the Deputy is in fact referring to Children First — National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, published in 1999.  The issue of putting the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing was raised in the public consultation process which contributed to the 2007 / 2008 review of the Guidelines. It is suggested that to follow a path of statutory obligation would possibly lead to a form of mandatory reporting.  Legal advice obtained from this Department's legal advisor would also support this view.The introduction of mandatory reporting has previously been considered by Government, and has not been proceeded with, on the basis that it has not been proven that this would result in greater protection for children, and there is a danger that scarce child protection resources would be diverted into an extensive administrative burden and the implementation of sanctions.  There is international evidence that mandatory reporting has both positive and negative consequences associated with it. The complexities involved with the implementation of mandatory reporting have been acknowledged.  It is considered that, at this stage, a renewed focus on the provision of a more effective child welfare and protection system, through improved implementation of the existing guidelines, training and education and good recruitment procedures, is the best way forward.It is important to note that Children First, although not on a statutory basis, still brings with it very clear responsibilities for those who become aware of child protection issues and these responsibilities are those we would reasonably expect everyone in society to live up to in relation to caring for children.A Senior Officials group (comprising staff of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Health Service Executive, An Garda Síochána, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department of Education and Science) was established in the wake of the publication of the McElwee Report, and is conducting regular meetings. Its focus is to ensure that there is full awareness of child protection policies, guidelines and procedures, and to advise the Minister accordingly. It is being chaired by the OMCYA.

Dublin, the cost of developing the hospital will be met from the proceeds of the sale of the existing site in Dundrum, Co Dublin.  The development of the new hospital is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive and therefore the question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.The Deputy may wish to note that the cost of acquiring the site for the new prison and hospital was €29,900,000.  An additional 8.7 acres, at a cost of  €1,305,000, was later acquired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide a dedicated access road to the prison construction site.

There has been a significant reduction in the number of people waiting for surgical procedures from 7.4 per 1,000 population in 2002 to 4.3 per 1,000 in 2008.The NTPF will continue in 2009 to arrange in-patient and out-patient care for persons on hospital waiting lists.  At my request,  the NTPF, working with the HSE, will maintain a particular focus on the issue of people waiting for more than twelve months for treatment.  I am pleased to say that, as a result of the efforts made by both organisations during 2008, the total number of persons waiting over 12 months was reduced by 66%, from 4637 to 1576 between December 2007 and December 2008.

Of these, 3,544 were referred to the HSE for direct reply.  In 2007, the Executive aimed to operate within a timeframe of 20 working days from the date of answer of a parliamentary question for the issue of a final reply to a deputy. This target was reached for 65% of referred questions. From January 2008 the HSE's Chief Executive Officer introduced a shorter timeframe of 15 working days for replies to parliamentary questions and this target was reached for 73% of referred questions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	734	Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	737	I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 and 487 together.Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, a fair deal, individuals who require long-term residential care will contribute a maximum of 80% of their net assessable income whether for public or private nursing home care. In calculating an individual's net assessable income, it is proposed that account can be taken of specified items of expenditure.  Depending on the amount of a person's assessable income, there may also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person's assets in excess of the asset disregard per annum. The asset disregard is €36,000 for an individual or €72,000 for a couple. Assets will include both cash and non-cash assets. If a person had received damages in the form of a cash settlement, it would be taken into account in this context.The State will meet the balance of cost thereafter in public or private nursing homes and an individual's family and/or friends will not have to contribute towards the cost of their care. An individual can choose any nursing home subject to a) its ability to meet their care needs and b) availability.  Contributions based on Irish land-based assets may be deferred for the duration of a person's lifetime and repaid from their estate.  If an individual opts to defer this portion of the contribution, the Revenue Commissioners will collect it upon settlement of their estate. However, this deferred contribution element of the scheme is voluntary.  Individuals may choose to pay as they go in which case no money would be repayable from their estate.Where the contribution is based on the principal private residence, it will be capped at a maximum of 15%, or 7.5% in the case of one spouse going into long-term residential care while the other remains in the home. This means that after three years in care, an individual will not be liable for any further deferred contribution based on the principal residence.  Where a spouse or certain dependants are living in the principal residence, the contribution may be further deferred until after the death of that spouse or dependant, or until such time as a person previously qualifying as a dependant ceases to qualify as such.The financial assessment will only take account of a person's assets at the time of the assessment. However, as with the existing subvention scheme, individual cases will be reviewed on a regular basis and the level of State support adjusted accordingly if necessary. The Bill provides for a person to apply for a review of their case should their circumstances change, e.g. should they be awarded a settlement. The Bill only provides for the HSE to recoup money advanced in the form of State support if it was obtained on the basis of a non-disclosure or a misstatement during the financial assessment.  Finally, the new scheme will not be limited to persons over the age of 65. Any person who enters long-term residential care in a nursing home will be able to apply to avail of the scheme.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	738	Under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) which is implemented under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006 -2010, payments are made by Pobal to community based childcare groups, generally on a quarterly basis.  The final payments in 2008 were made during October — December, and the first payments for 2009 are being made this month (at the equivalent of the quarterly rate payable at the end of last year).  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is necessary to provide for CCSS payments in respect of 2009 from within the 2009 allocation.  As a result, the first CCSS payments issued in 2009 were made on 9 January.To date, I am informed that approximately 80% of services have received a payment for 2009, and that a majority of the remainder are required to submit additional outstanding documentation to Pobal.  My Office and Pobal have been in contact with these services on an ongoing basis, in order to resolve such matters, and I understand that a number of groups will receive a payment this week.There are some 850 services participating in the CCSS, and to qualify for a 2009 payment, they were required to make an electronic return, and also to forward signed parental forms from parents and a form signed by the service manager confirming adherence to measures which ensure compliance with Data Protection legislation.  If a group made a late return, or made a return where the parents did not sign the forms authorising this sharing of information, or where the service manager did not sign his/er declaration regarding Data Protection, this has delayed that process for those groups.These returns were made in respect of a reference week last September, and groups were asked that this be completed by 26 September, as they have to be checked with the Department of Social and Family Affairs (D/SFA).  Unfortunately, only a minority of groups met the deadlines for submission of full and compliant returns, and so this deadline was extended to the end of the year, and an initial batch of services which had made returns with no outstanding issues were forwarded to D/SFA.  Of these, some 230 groups were informed of their 2009 funding during November and December 2008.  A further 58 groups have been informed of their 2009 funding this month, and it is hoped that all outstanding groups will all know their 2009 funding in full by the end of next month.

Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioner services. In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP. In June 2006, I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards. For medical card and GP visit card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income. Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing the eligibility criteria for medical cards with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible, taking into account financial, medical and social need.

The contracts provide that facilities must remain in operation for a certain number of years (depending on the amount of the grant) following receipt of the final instalment of the grant.If a grant beneficiary is in breach of contract by closing the service before the date stated in the contract, then decommittal and recovery proceedings will commence.  These procedures take into account the length of time that the service has operated, and the calculations are made on a pro-rata basis.  Each decommittal is considered on a case-by-case basis so that any particular individual circumstances may be taken into account.  The procedures cannot commence until Pobal receives confirmation (from the beneficiary or from a third party) of the closure of the facility.Until the final instalment of the grant is received, the service provider is obliged to regularly report and account for all expenditure incurred.  Once this process has been concluded, the provider is required to complete an annual Confirmation of Continued Service document until his or her contractual obligations are fulfilled, i.e. for the requisite number of years as laid down in the contract.  The facility in question received the final instalment of its grant in August 2008, and had been reporting and accounting for its expenditure appropriately throughout until this time.  While the facility in question did not notify Pobal of its closure, the non-return of a Confirmation of Continued Service document at the end of 2008 would have brought the position to light.  Pobal has since written to the service provider requesting confirmation of the position and, when this is confirmed, any appropriate decommittal and recovery proceedings will be commenced.

The legislation provides for two different classes of person for the purpose of levying a charge.Class 1Class 1 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.Class 2Class 2 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 2008 amend the 2005 regulations and provide for the first increase in the level of long stay charges payable since 2005.  The following revised level of charges will apply.In the case of Class 1 a weekly charge of €153.25 or the weekly income of that person less €44.70, whichever is the lesser. In the case of Class 2 a weekly charge of €114.95 or the weekly income of that person less €70.25 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.  The actual charge levied will vary from person to person depending on individual circumstances and under the legislation the Health Service Executive can waive or reduce the charges to avoid undue financial hardship.The increase in the level of long stay charge levied is directly linked to recent increases in social welfare entitlements.  The new weekly charge for Class 1 of €153.25 represents an increase of €33.25 or 27.7% on the 2005 charges and the new weekly charge for Class 2 of €114.95 represents an increase of €24.95 or 27.7% on the 2005 charges.  In the corresponding period from 2005 to 2009 the rate of Disability Allowance payable has increased by €55.50 or 37.7%.  The rate of Disability Allowance has increased from €148.80 in 2005 to €204.30 in 2009.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	746	I have communicated with the Deputy in respect of the information sought by him.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	747	Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly allowance administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who are living at home and who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age may qualify.  The condition must be likely to last for at least one year.Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved, subject to the means test.  As the Deputy's questions partly relate to service matters and a named individual I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	748	Regulation (EC) 1408/71 deals with the coordination of social security schemes, including healthcare, for those moving within the European Union. Under its provisions persons residing in Ireland who are attached to the social security system of another member state are entitled to receive healthcare services in Ireland at the cost of the member state to which they are attached. Such persons receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement. The provisions of Regulation (EC) 1408/71 supersede national eligibility provisions.  Age is irrelevant to entitlements under the Regulation.  That entitlement is based in the aforementioned Regulation and not in the Health Act 1970, as amended, and as such, the means testing arrangements do not apply to people qualifying under Regulation (EC) 1408/71.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	749	The main area of direct funding to voluntary groups by my Department is the National Childcare Investment Programme 20006-2010 (NCIP). This is managed by the Childcare Directorate of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. (OMCYA).  The key elements of the NCIP are the delivery of a capital grant scheme to develop childcare facilities, which is open to both commercial and community-based providers including voluntary groups, and the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme 2008-2010 (CCSS), which is confined to community-based providers including voluntary groups.In the case of both schemes, applicants are required to demonstrate that their project meets value for money criteria, including sustainability.  However, as independent childcare providers, responsibility for management of the services' administrative and salary costs rests with the provider.  Implementation of the NCIP at local level is supported by 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) which are companies limited by guarantee and managed by voluntary boards. The OMCYA advises the CCCs of the maximum pay levels which may be paid to their staff from the funding provided. The CCCs were included in a Value for Money Review of the childcare investment programmes which was undertaken by the OMCYA and published in 2007.My Department also issues grants under the National Lottery Fund and it is a condition of these grants that certification of expenditure be submitted to my Department as soon as possible after the end of the financial year or when the project is completed to ensure that the funding is spent on the particular project for which it was allocated.  The issue of salary levels does not therefore arise within this context.The HSE also funds a wide range of bodies to provide services on its behalf or services which are similar or ancillary to the services it provides.  The terms under which the HSE provides this funding is broadly governed by sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.  Theses bodies would range from large voluntary hospitals and providers of services for people with a disability to small voluntary groups providing services in their local community.With respect to these bodies it is a matter for the HSE to conclude the necessary agreements in respect of the terms and conditions under which services are provided by them.  The same pay and conditions as are applied to the HSE, would also apply to those voluntary bodies whose employees are members of the public sector pension schemes and who are deemed to be public servants.  This would include the major voluntary organisations providing services for people with disabilities and the voluntary hospitals.  These are covered by circulars issued by my Department which set out the pay for each grade as approved by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance. It is a condition of any arrangement under section 38 of the 2004 Act that the body concerned must submit its annual accounts to the HSE for examination.Following on from the recommendations made in the C&AG report Provision of Disability Services by Non-Profit Organisations published in 2005   the Health Service Executive has been engaged in a process of strengthening existing Service Level Agreements [SLAs] and Grant Aid Agreements for all service providers funded by the HSE, as provided for under Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.  This process has included substantial consultation with the umbrella organisations representing the voluntary sector and representatives of the Association of Hospitals.   These agreements  will further strengthen the accountability of all service providers, including voluntary groups to ensure that services are provided in the most cost efficient manner possible.  My Department is in consultation with the HSE in relation to the finalisation and implementation of these agreements.

Current policy and best practice in regard to health service delivery for blind/visually impaired children is that children who are blind/visually impaired remain in their local schools with appropriate supports.  This position was indicated to the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Science in November 2005.  The issue of service and capital developments within the Health and Educational Sectors are matters for the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Science, within their annual Votes.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I refer the Deputy to my previous reply of 9 December 2008.  Issues surrounding this case have been the subject of a number of inquiries dating back to 1995.  It is not my intention to establish a further inquiry.  Counselling support has been put in place by the Health Service Executive (HSE) for former patients of the person concerned following the findings of the recent Medical Council Inquiry.  The service will continue to be made available as required and the need for additional support will continue to be monitored.  The HSE has assigned co-ordinating responsibility for these matters to the Area Manager for Consumer Affairs in the North East who will liaise as required with former patients and support groups.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	757	Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	758	The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible, in an effective and efficient way.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.  The overriding aim, which I fully support, is that services are organised and managed to improve patient safety and to achieve better standards of care for patients.The HSE 2009 National Service Plan includes provision for a review of the existing arrangements whereby 11 hospitals in Dublin and three in Cork operate 24 hour 7 day Emergency Departments.  The review will involve consideration of whether it is necessary to maintain full Emergency Department services in each hospital beyond the peak hours of operation and whether this represents the best use of resources.  The HSE will also continue the work which is underway in reviewing the configuration of hospital services, with a particular focus on the North East, Mid-West and Southern regions, in order to ensure that such services are configured in a way which optimises clinical outcomes for patients.

There are currently sixty-four approved centres. The Inspectorate has focused on the approved centres as these provide inpatient care and treatment for people with a mental illness or mental disorder. To date, the Inspector has not been in a position to inspect day care or workshop facilities.  However, it is the intention to expand the range of facilities inspected during 2009.

Of these, 4,883 were also in receipt of an enhanced subvention.  Since the enactment of the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Act 2007, the level of subvention that a person receives is no longer linked to their level of dependency, i.e. medium, high and maximum. The 2007 Act simply provides for a determination to be made as to whether an individual needs to be maintained in a nursing home or not. Once an individual is deemed to require long-term residential care, they can apply for subvention and may receive any amount up to a maximum basic subvention of €300 per week. This is determined on the basis of a means assessment.

After a rigorous testing and commissioning phase, it is expected that the new terminal will open to the public in April 2010.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	774	In February 2007 the Government approved an €86 million programme of grant aid under the Transport 21 umbrella for specific projects at the six regional airports (Galway, Waterford, Kerry, Sligo, Knock and Donegal) up to the end of 2010.  This consists of €39 million at the 90% rate for safety and security improvements and €47 million at the 75% rate for developmental projects aimed at increasing capacity in the sector.All of the regional airports are engaged in the implementation of projects approved under the capital grant scheme.  So far, grants paid under the scheme, amounting to just over €13 million, reflect the fact that for most airports, major projects have been at the preparatory stages or have been subject to delays arising from planning or procurement procedures.  The provision in the Department's Vote to fund the scheme in 2009 is €11 million.Because of the current difficulties with the public finances, full implementation of the approved capital programme will take longer than originally anticipated.  Meanwhile, the Department is working to establish priorities for grant aid from the funds available in 2009, having regard to projects already contractually committed and a realistic assessment of the actual drawdown requirements for safety and security-related projects likely to arise during the year.

By improving and transforming transport links all around the country it gives visitors to Ireland greater options when it comes to travelling between our cities and accessing rural locations.  Significant development of the national road network has taken place under Transport 21, improving access and reducing journey times around the country.  One of the five major inter-urban motorways (the M1) is already completed, and the other four are on target for completion in 2010.Improvements have also taken place in public transport.  Iarnród Éireann is in the process of introducing new Intercity railcars across the network, bringing a new standard of comfort and quality to train travel. The Ennis to Athenry phase of the Western Rail Corridor and the Cork to Midleton rail lines are both scheduled to begin services in Summer of 2009. As part of a comprehensive package of investment in the bus network, Transport 21 is also funding new vehicles for Bus Eireann.

By improving and transforming transport links all around the country it provides greater options when it comes to travelling between our cities and accessing rural locations.As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21. The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the relevant local authorities concerned. Information on the various road projects is on my Department's Transport 21 website  www.transport21.ie.Public Transport projects funded under Transport 21 which have benefited the Limerick area include: the new InterCity railcars which have been introduced on the Limerick-Dublin route in January 2008 as part of the €402 million upgrade of the intercity fleet which will facilitate an increase in daily services from 4 to 8 each way in 2009; the upgrading of re-fuelling and maintenance facilities at Limerick Depot on which €1.75 million was spent in 2006; upgrade works on the rail system in Limerick as part of the Railway Safety Programme; improvement works on the Limerick-Ballybrophy line which included track renewal, signal upgrading, level crossings; structures and fencing facilitated an increase in services; the commencement of Limerick-Galway services on the Western Rail Corridor in 2009 will also benefit the Limerick region.As part of the re-opening of the Western Rail Corridor a new station will be opened at Sixmilebridge; 27 new buses purchased since 2000 are in use in Limerick city, funded under the NDP and Transport 21.  The entire Limerick City service fleet is comprised of low-floor fully accessible vehicles.- Bus Éireann's nationwide network of Expressway and local services in Limerick is highly integrated to offer the widest range of connections possible to its customers.

The provision of car parking at railway stations is a matter for Iarnród Éireann in conjunction with local authorities.  Iarnród Éireann are carrying out a network-wide programme of expanding existing or developing new car parks, with the assistance of Exchequer funding, to cater for demand.Within the past year car parks have been opened or been extended at eight train stations namely Leixlip Louisa Bridge, Mallow, Ennis, Tullamore, Arklow, Limerick, Hazelhatch and Gormonston resulting in over 1,350 extra car parking spaces.  New car parks are also due to open at Portmarnock, Newbridge, Rush & Lusk, Donabate, Laytown, Portarlington, Carlow, Wicklow, Gorey and Limerick Junction over the next eighteen months.  I understand that Iarnród Éireann is currently examining a number of other locations for their suitability for expansion.  To date, Exchequer funding of €21m has been allocated for the car park expansion programme.There are currently four Park and Ride sites along the existing Luas network at Red Cow, Sandyford, Stillorgan and  Balally. The Luas Park and Ride facility at Tallaght is temporarily closed and Luas passengers are being accommodated in an adjacent facility.  The Luas Park and Ride facility at Sandyford is currently closed to facilitate work on the extension of the Luas Green Line to Cherrywood.  When the Luas extension to Cherrywood is complete, the Sandyford Park and Ride will re-open but with a reduced capacity for around 45 cars.The RPA is in discussion with a private developer and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council on the provision of a Park and Ride facility at Carrickmines in the context of the Luas extension to Cherrywood which is currently under construction.  The planned extension of the Luas Red Line to Citywest provides for a Park and Ride facility at Cheeverstown.  Metro North, which will run from St. Stephen's Green to Swords via Dublin Airport, will have 3 Park and Ride sites. These will be located at Belinstown, north of Swords, Fosterstown, south of Swords and at Dardistown between the Airport and the M50.  The preferred route for the further extension of the Green line from Cherrywood to the Bray area provides for a Park and Ride facility at Fassaroe.The RPA hopes to provide Park and Ride facilities at a number of key locations along the proposed Metro West route.  In particular, RPA is investigating Park and Ride facilities from the N2 (Ashbourne) at the proposed Huntstown and Meakstown stops, the N3 (Navan) at the Blanchardstown stop, the N4 (Lucan) at the Quarryvale stop and the N7 (Naas) at the Newlands stop. Additional facilities might also be provided at other locations.I have made funding available to local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area to provide park and ride facilities.  It is a matter for the local authorities to develop proposals and to apply for funding.  To date I have received no such applications.  However, the local authorities in question are continuing to explore the possibilities for such facilities.  In this regard, An Bord Pleanála recently refused planning permission for a proposed facility on the N4 for South Dublin County Council.  I have also made funding available in the regional cities for bus priority and park and ride facilities.  It is a matter for the local authorities to develop proposals and apply for funding.Funding has been provided to Cork City Council for a successful park and ride facility at Black Ash, and my Department is in discussion with the Council regarding a proposal for a similar facility on the Western side of Cork City.  I understand that other regional cities are also seeking to develop proposals, taking account of the constraints of obtaining suitable sites.

I am aware that they are in use in some countries, whether as a legal requirement or on a voluntary basis, but at an EU level there are no proposals for their general introduction.  Countries differ in their approaches to the prevention of drink driving and to changing driver behaviour.  In Ireland the focus is on strict anti-drink driving legislation, and appropriate penalties for infringements, combined with an emphasis on enforcement.  The introduction of mandatory alcohol testing has been credited with a significant change in the attitude to drink driving in Ireland, which resulted in the lowest number of road fatalities on record last year.

Pobal administers the RTP on behalf of my Department and makes specific funding allocations to the individual RTP groups from funding provided by my Department. Neither I nor my Department have any role in relation to the day to day management of the Programme including allocating funds to particular groups or for services.One of the key strengths of the Programme is that local communities know best where the transport needs are in their rural areas and how best to address those needs. The RTP groups are, therefore, responsible for deciding on the specific services to be provided and the methods of provision.  However, it is a clear principle of the Programme that RTP funded services should complement and not compete with the existing public transport services provided either by CIE Companies or by private transport operators.

Government took the view that the Ryanair Offer greatly undervalued Aer Lingus.  Competition in the Irish airline sector was also a major consideration. The cornerstone of Irish aviation policy is, and has been for many years, to encourage competition. Because we live on an island Irish consumers depend very heavily on air transport.  The virtual monopoly that would have resulted if the Offer had been accepted would not have been in the best interests of Irish consumers. The Offer by Ryanair did not include any remedies to address the negative impact the takeover would have had on competition.Other considerations also taken into account in reaching the decision to reject the Offer were the impact of the takeover on airports policy and consequently on regional development policy.  Government was also mindful of the importance of ensuring maximum connectivity for Irish air travellers and concluded that this was best ensured in a competitive market.

Where proposed services by the Company are deemed to be in competition with services that are the subject of a licence held by a private bus operator issued under the Road Transport Act, 1932, Dublin Bus is required to obtain my consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 before the Company can introduce such services.My Department received a proposal from Dublin Bus on 1st May, 2008 for changes to its Route 37. Following an initial examination, which included consultation with Dublin Bus, my Department deemed that the proposal would give rise to competition with an existing licensed service.  Accordingly, my Department advised Dublin Bus on 9th June, 2008 that an application in accordance with Section 25 of the Transport Act, 1958 was required.Dublin Bus subsequently submitted a revised proposal for this route.

The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) lodged copies of the Railway Order application for Metro North with An Bórd Pleanála in September 2008 and their decision in that regard is awaited. In addition, the RPA continues to make good progress on the PPP tender process for Metro North.  Receipt of tenders is now required by end February this year.As I have stated previously, I am not in a position, given its commerciality sensitivity, to give any information in relation to the budget for Metro North in advance of the completion of the public procurement process.  The start and completion dates of Transport 21 projects, which have not yet commenced, will be determined by the outcome of the statutory approval and procurement processes and the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate.  My priority for public transport is to deliver additional capacity across all modes as quickly as possible and major projects, such as Metro North, will be hugely important in this regard.This year I have allocated in excess of €200m to the Railway Procurement Agency to progress Luas and Metro projects, including provision for the start of enabling works on Metro North.  The amount of expenditure on Metro North in 2009 is contingent on the grant of an enforceable railway order by An Bórd Pleanála.  In accordance with the requirements of the Government decision on Transport 21, Metro North will be submitted to Government for a final decision on the project on the completion of the tender process.

Subject to that duty, in January 2008 the State's nominees on the Board of Aer Lingus were issued with a mandate to ensure that all future decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at Board level.  In accordance with the mandate the State's nominees are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives.  I did not give any further directions to the State's nominees on the Board in relation to Ryanair's recent Cash Offer for Aer Lingus.The Board of Aer Lingus rejected the Offer in its defence document published on 22 December 2008 and recommended to shareholders that they take no action in relation to the Offer.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has rejected Ryanair's Cash Offer of €1.40 per share for the State's 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus. Government took the view that the Ryanair Offer greatly undervalued Aer Lingus.  Competition in the Irish airline sector was also a major consideration. The virtual monopoly that would have resulted if the Offer had been accepted would not have been in the best interests of Irish consumers. In 2007 the EU Commission blocked the previous bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus following an extensive investigation of the bid under the EU Merger Regulation.  At that time the Commission concluded that a merger of the two companies would have harmed consumers by removing competition and creating a monopoly or dominant position on 35 routes operated by both companies.  The competition rules and the same competition considerations applied to the latest bid also and no remedies were offered by Ryanair to address these competition concerns.Other considerations also taken into account in reaching the decision to reject the most recent Offer were the impact of the takeover on airports policy and consequently on regional development policy.  Government was also mindful of the importance of ensuring maximum connectivity for Irish air travellers and concluded that this was best ensured in a competitive market.

These proposals are based on recommendations of the Government Alcohol Advisory Group and are part of the Government's overall strategy to address the public disorder and public health aspects of excessive alcohol consumption and binge drinking.The draft regulations, which were drawn up in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Office of the Attorney General, were notified to the European Commission in December last as required under the Technical Standards Directive.  This reporting arrangement is intended to ensure that national measures are in full accord with the smooth functioning of the EU internal market.  The Commission has a period of at least three months, i.e. until March 2009, to examine the draft proposals and other member States may also submit observations.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  An application for long term residency from the first person referred to by the Deputy was received in March 2007.  I am informed by my officials that this application is in the latter stages of processing. As soon as a decision is made in his case, the person concerned will be notified. My Department does not have any record of an application for long term residency on behalf of the second person referred to by the Deputy.

Furthermore, as regards the issue of EAWs and extradition requests generally, I am advised that it is not the practice to comment in any particular case until the subject concerned is brought before a court as to do so may have the effect of alerting the person in question to the proceedings.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	825	The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 came into effect on 30 July, 2008. It introduced tougher public order provisions, allowing the Gardaí to seize alcohol from minors and to seize alcohol where they have a reasonable apprehension of public order or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned. Provision was also made to issue fixed charge notices for certain offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.I am informed by the Garda authorities that a partnership approach is utilised by local Garda management with the various stakeholders in the licensing trade, including licensees, local authorities, fast-food outlets, public transport providers, including the taxi industry and MEAS (Mature Enjoyment of Alcohol in Society), as well as local community groups and schools so as to ensure a sensible and lawful approach to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol.The reality is that in any criminal justice system it takes time for changes which are made in the law to have full effect in practice. However, statistics for the third quarter of 2008 provided by the Central Statistics Office show a decrease of 2.9% during the quarter in public order and related offences. The statistics also show a decrease of 39.3% in liquor licensing offences for the same quarter, which reflects an increased level of compliance by licensees with the law in this area.  I am confident that the restrictions on the availability and visibility of alcohol provided for in the Act, along with the provisions for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse in particular anti-social behaviour, will contribute to bringing about more responsible behaviour on the part of those concerned.Statutory provisions relating to the grant by the District Court of ‘special exemption orders' which permit extended opening hours for special occasions in certain categories of licensed premises are set out in section 5 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927, as amended by section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 and section 10 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  While I am keeping the law in this area under review, I have no plans to amend current statutory provisions in respect of special exemption orders.

Members of An Garda Síochána carry out planned and unplanned checkpoints, including those carried out under Operation Anvil and mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints.Under Department of Finance legislation the registration of vehicles is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their officers, who are based at numerous locations in the State, carry out regular and ongoing checks to identify and deal with breaches of vehicle registration tax regulations in connection with the use of foreign registered vehicles in the State. They also carry out coordinated national enforcement campaigns under finance legislation to detect infringements of law in this area.I am informed by the Garda authorities that mobile patrols have been directed by local Garda management to pay particular attention to the Balbriggan Garda District. I am further informed that in the Balbriggan Garda District in 2008, An Garda Síochána seized under the provisions of road traffic legislation and finance legislation, 319 vehicles for the offences of no driving licence, no insurance and the non-display of a current tax disc or NCT certificate. To date, 162 proceedings have commenced for the offence of having no tax displayed and 147 proceedings have commenced for the offence of having no insurance in 2008.An Garda Síochána will continue to conduct enforcement initiatives to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries, increase driver awareness, promote an improved compliance culture amongst the road-users and prevent and detect breaches of road traffic and transport legislation.

Members of the local Community Policing Unit allocated to this area liaise with the local community providing crime prevention advice, and assistance, particularly in relation to anti-social type behaviour, including car theft.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is aware of difficulties being experienced by residents in the area referred to and have put a number of measures in place to address this type of criminality. Garda foot and mobile patrols have been directed to pay particular attention to the area concerned, with a view to ensuring a visible Garda presence.

This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	834	Immigration legislation does not provide for immigration controls on persons travelling by air within the State and any change to such legislation is a matter for Government.  Arrangements for disembarking passengers at the State's airports currently do not allow for the separation of passengers from flights within the State and those arriving on flights originating outside the State. Consequently, all arriving passengers must pass through Immigration Controls to ensure that those persons who, by law, require the permission of an immigration officer to enter the State are subject to the proper controls.Any change to these arrangements is a matter for the relevant authorities who would have to be satisfied that airport security and the integrity of the immigration process would not be compromised.  With regard to immigration procedures generally at Dublin airport and indeed at the other international airports in the State, the position is that under the provisions of Section 11(1) of the Immigration Act, 2004 every person (other than a person under the age of 16 years) landing in the State shall be in possession of a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality to the satisfaction of an immigration officer.Section 11(2) states every person landing in or embarking from the State shall furnish to an immigration officer such information in such manner as the immigration officer may reasonably require for the purposes of the performance of his or her functions. These sections are qualified by Section 11(4), which states that this section does not apply to any person (other than a non-national) coming from or embarking for a place in the State, Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Section 11 creates two categories of traveller; non-nationals who are obliged to carry documents and assist immigration officers in the performance of their duties and those who are not so obliged (Irish and UK citizens).  This clearly creates an onus on an immigration officer to satisfy himself or herself into which category a traveller falls so that he/she can apply the provisions of the Act appropriately.

The Bill will include provisions dealing with the indexation of fines, payment of fines by instalment, equality of impact of fines imposed by the courts and the powers of the courts where a person does not pay a fines by its due date for payment.I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that a total of 276 citizens were imprisoned in 2008 for debtor offences. Debtor offences comprise of failure to meet loan repayments to banks and other financial institutions, including credit unions, but also include failure to pay maintenance debt, hire purchase agreements or creditor loans.  These 276 citizens were responsible for 306 debt offences as some had been imprisoned on more than one occasion for a debt offence in 2008.  The breakdown per month is set out in the table below.MonthOffencesJanuary19February24March22April21May23June27July41August21September18October25November33December32Total306The average length of sentence imposed on each offence was 27 days. The average length of sentence served was 20 days. Please note some persons paid their debt while in prison which would automatically release them from their sentence. The cost of all said detentions for 2008 is not yet available until completion of the Appropriation Accounts later this year.  I can advise the Deputy that the number of such persons held in custody at any one time is a tiny fraction of the overall prisoner population.  To illustrate this point, figures relating to 22 January, 2009  indicate that less than 0.6 percent of the numbers in prison custody fell into this category.

There were 355 people on the charters and 28,059 people on the scheduled flights, making a total of 28,414 arriving at the airport during the day.  This was higher than the 2008 daily average of 26,447.  Arrangements for disembarking passengers at Dublin Airport do not allow for the separation of passengers from domestic flights within the State and those arriving on flights originating outside the State.  Consequently, all arriving passengers must pass through immigration controls to ensure that those who, by law, require the permission of an immigration officer to enter the State are subject to the proper controls.  On the date in question, personnel from three rostered units were on duty at Dublin Airport.  The allocation of immigration personnel at Dublin Airport is designed to have the maximum number of staff on duty during peak periods.  Every effort is made by immigration officers to exercise their function as speedily as possible but delays may occur on occasion.  Passenger volumes may contribute to the delays.The number of flights and the time of arrival at Dublin Airport is a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority and not within the remit of the Garda Síochána.  Liaison is maintained between the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Dublin Airport Authority to ensure that passenger flows are managed as efficiently as possible.  Staffing levels at Dublin Airport are reviewed by Garda management on a regular basis and daily duty allocations are closely monitored to ensure the efficient movement of passengers arriving at the airport.  A competition for the selection of additional personnel for assignment to the Garda National Immigration Bureau at Dublin Airport has recently been completed.  Arrangements for the allocation of the additional personnel are currently being made with a view to keeping delays in the immigration function at Dublin Airport to a minimum.

The fees were as follows:(a) where an application was made on behalf of a minor, a fee of €126.97(b) where an application was made by a spouse of a naturalised Irish citizen, a fee of €126.97(c) where an application was made by a widow or widower of an Irish citizen, a fee of €126.97(d) in the case of all other applications, a fee of €634.87(e) the fee payable under (a), (b),(c) or (d) shall be nil, if the application for the certificate concerned was made by or on behalf of a refugee or stateless person or by or on behalf of a programme refugee.The Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Fees) Regulations 2008 set out the prescribed fees payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation since 1 August 2008. The fees are as follows:(a) where an application is made on behalf of a minor, a fee of €200(b) where an application is made by a spouse of a naturalised Irish citizen, a fee of €950(c) where an application is made by a widow or widower of an Irish citizen, a fee of €200(d) in the case of all other applications, a fee of €950(e) the fee payable under (a), (b), (c), or (d) shall be nil, if the application for the certificate concerned was made by or on behalf of a refugee or stateless person or by or on behalf of a programme refugee.The increases are in line with inflation for the period 1993 to 2008.  Previous regulations contained an anomaly whereby spouses of naturalised Irish citizens paid a lower fee than spouses of Irish-born citizens.  All spouses now pay the same fee for the same processing effort.  While the fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing the different categories of applicant, the certification fees do not recoup the full cost of processing in any category.  A copy of the certificate of naturalisation is available in English from the Citizenship Division of my Department on request.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 31 March 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.  Her case was then examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State.  On 18 November 2005, my predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a deportation order in respect of her.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring her to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday, 1 December 2005 to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.  She failed to present on this occasion.A request for leave to remain on humanitarian grounds was received from the legal representative of person concerned by correspondence dated 14 December 2005 seeking revocation of her deportation order.  A stay was put on the order until the matters raised were considered.  This decision was notified to the legal representative of the person concerned by letter dated 22 December 2005.  Subsequently, a decision was taken to affirm the deportation order and this decision was communicated to the legal representative of the person concerned by letter dated 15 March 2006.  Further representations were then received from the said legal representative by correspondence dated 22 and 27 March 2006 seeking to have the decision to affirm the deportation order set aside.At this point my predecessor put a stay on a decision regarding the affirmation of the deportation order until July 2006 to allow for the lodgment of additional medical reports for his consideration.  Further medical reports were lodged by the legal representative of the person concerned on 3 July 2006 together with a follow-up letter dated 30 August 2006 enclosing a doctor's letter dated 29 August 2006.  All these matters were considered and a decision was taken to once again affirm the deportation order.  This decision was communicated to the person concerned and her legal representative by letter dated 27 September 2006.  In addition, the person concerned was required to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau on Tuesday, 17 October 2006 to make arrangements for her removal from the State.  This letter was returned to my Department marked "not collected by addressee".  A further letter dated 28 November 2006 was issued to a new address following advice that the person concerned had not received the earlier correspondence.  On this occasion she was again advised that the earlier decision to make a deportation order was unchanged and she was required to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau on Thursday, 14 December 2006 to make arrangements for her removal from the State. She presented on this occasion and was given further presentation dates.  However, she was due to present on 22 February 2007 but failed to do so.In the meantime and by letter dated 7 July 2008, further representations seeking temporary leave to remain in the State were received from the person concerned.  Following consideration of same, the deportation order was affirmed by me on 4 December 2008.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 23 December 2008 which also required her to present herself at Anglesea Street Garda station in Cork on Monday, 12 January 2009 to make arrangements for her removal from the State.  She presented on this occasion and is due to present again on 9 February 2009.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.  The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the deportation order is an operational matter for the GNIB.The second person referred to by the Deputy, a Nigerian man, arrived in the State on 13 January 2007 and applied for asylum on 22 January 2007.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 14 September 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why he should not be deported.  I should also mention that a person who has been refused refugee status and has been served with a notice of intention to deport is, since 10 October 2006, afforded a fourth option, viz. to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006.By correspondence dated 13 November 2007, an application for subsidiary protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by his legal representative.  Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused.  The man and his legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 26 June 2008.  His case was then examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf by his legal representative for permission to remain in the State.  On 30 October 2008, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a deportation order in respect of him.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday, 27 November 2008 to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.He failed to present  and was classified as evading his deportation.  If he comes to the notice of the Garda, he will be liable to arrest and detention.  He should, therefore, present himself to the GNIB without further delay.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for subsidiary protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the deportation order is an operational matter for the GNIB.

This permission was subsequently renewed for a year to 18 November 2008 and the person concerned was informed of this decision by letter dated 19 November 2007.  The person concerned has applied for this permission to be renewed for a further one year period and this application is currently under consideration.  The person will be notified in writing of the outcome.  There are no records in my Department of the person having submitted an application for family reunification.  The Deputy might wish to note that the position in the State of the person is not such as would confer any statutory entitlement under family reunification provisions.

Certain categories of applicant receive a faster decision as their cases are less complex and require less processing and assessment.  These include refugees, spouses of Irish citizens and applications made on behalf of minors.  In exceptional circumstances, I may expedite a decision on an application.  Each application is assessed individually.The average processing time from application to decision is now 23 months.  More complicated cases can at times take considerably more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that timescale.  There is a limit to the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

The following cars were purchased for the fleet in 2008: three BMW 525s, one Audi A6, one Volvo S80, one Citroen C6, one Mercedes S320 and one Ford Galaxy.  In line with the aim of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, all cars are diesel powered.  The total amount of money spent on new State cars for office holders in 2008 was €509,675.85.  For commercial reasons, it is not proposed to provide a breakdown of the cost of each car.There are no set rules as to when office holder cars are replaced.  In general, cars are replaced when, due to age, condition and/or mileage, they are considered no longer economic to maintain.  It is not possible to say at this stage what cars will be purchased this year.  Due to the age profile of the fleet, a significant number of cars were replaced during 2007 and 2008.  Accordingly, a smaller number of cars are expected to need to be replaced this year.

Such an offence may occur where a person "who by any means" harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with him or her.  For the purposes of this section of the Act, harassment is defined as occurring where a person intentionally or recklessly seriously interferes with the others peace or privacy.  For example, an individual received a custodial sentence in the District Court in 2003 arising from criminal charges relating to the placing of cameras in areas of a dwelling where the tenants residing there could expect and assume to be private.The Privacy Bill 2006, which is currently before the Seanad, provides for a new tort of violation of privacy. Among other matters, this Bill provides that it shall be a violation of the privacy of an individual for a person to subject an individual to surveillance, which specifically includes both aural and visual surveillance.  There are also provisions contained in the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003 which are designed to apply to personal data which is recorded through the operation of CCTV systems or other monitoring equipment.

As stated in my reply to Question No. 160 of 19 June 2008, the granting of permission to remain under the revised arrangements for the non-EEA parents of children born prior to 1 January, 2005, known as the IBC/05 Scheme, does not confer any entitlement or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related to the person granted permission or not, to enter the State.  All applicants to the scheme signed an undertaking to this effect.  The position with regard to a visa application remains that as stated in my reply to the aforementioned question.  It is open to all non-nationals who are resident outside the State and who are visa required to enter the State to apply to their nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate for an entry visa.

As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.  A final decision on each application is made following receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate.  If an applicant is granted refugee status, the matter of issuing an appropriate registration stamp is considered at that stage.

I am advised by the Garda authorities that a project board was established to analyse the policing needs of the re-aligned Galway division.  Local Garda management is fully satisfied that effective and efficient policing can be maintained in the areas affected by the proposed changes and that the level of service currently being provided will not be diluted by the boundary realignment.

The court, which uses a multidisciplinary approach, involves a range of Departments and agencies that are charged with dealing with various aspects of the problem of drug misuse.  The court operates with the assistance of a team which includes a probation and welfare officer, an addiction nurse, a Garda liaison officer, an education and training representative and counsellors.  The court's mission is to provide supervised treatment, education and rehabilitation for offenders with drug problems as an alternative to prison.The programme lasts for a minimum of 12 to 18 months.  A successful participant will demonstrate a willingness to become free of non-prescribed drugs and make a permanent lifestyle change.  Assessments to establish suitability for inclusion on the programme take ten weeks, on average.  The main incentive for participants is the knowledge that outstanding charges will be struck out if the participant successfully completes the programme and does not reoffend in the 12 months following graduation.  The programme operates on a points system designed to encourage the participants towards successful completion of the programme.Follow-up support for participants includes 12 months post-graduation supervision.  There is no formal procedure in place to monitor offences beyond that period.  However, there are indications that participation in the programme is linked to a decrease in criminal activity.  My Department is examining the operation of the court having regard to the Exchequer position.  Officials are looking at best practice elsewhere to see how the court's throughput levels might be increased.  It is intended to conclude this examination as soon as possible.  I will shortly be in contact with the Deputy with the up-to-date costs of the programme.

Accordingly, they can only be exercised in circumstances in which a member of the Garda reasonably suspects that an offence is being, or has been, committed.  These provisions do not confer a power of entry for the purpose of a random check.  I refer the Deputy to the response to Question No. 747 of today to my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

A final decision on each application is made following receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 9 September 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.

As the person in question's daughter is a Cameroonian national it is advised that she contact the Embassy of Cameroon, 84 Holland Park, London W11 3SB, England with a view to obtaining her national passport or travel document.  It should be noted that applications for an Irish travel document on behalf of children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a birth certificate which shows both parents' details.

The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee and in accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.I am informed that there is a discrepancy between the address the Deputy has provided and the address my Department holds on file. It is the responsibility of the applicant to keep the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) informed of any change of address in writing.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned was informed by letter dated 22 January 2003 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 12 July 2004 one of my predecessors refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay on Tuesday 10 August 2004 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. He failed to comply with his reporting requirements and was classified as evading his deportation.By letter dated 26 August 2008, the legal representative of the person concerned lodged an application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No.518 of 2006. By letter dated 10 September 2008 the legal representative of the person concerned was invited to make an application under Regulation 4(2) of the aforesaid Regulations setting out any new facts or circumstances relevant to the person concerned, or his country of origin, which had arisen since the original decision to deport was made and which related to a possible entitlement to Subsidiary Protection. A condition of this letter was that any representations were subject to a deadline of 10 working days from the date of the letter.No representations were received within the specified timeline and a decision was taken to issue a further letter dated 28 October 2008 requesting the lodgement of representations and, on that occasion, affording a timeline of 5 working days for the receipt of same. As no representations were forthcoming, a final letter dated 4 December 2008 issued to the legal representative of the person concerned advising that the GNIB had been informed to proceed with the enforcement of the Deportation Order.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.

An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in June 2007 and I decided to refuse the application.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in August 2008.  I understand that applications received in March 2007 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

The PRA replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.The Deputy will be aware of the service to TDs and Senators which provides information on the current status of applications and which was introduced in May 2006.  The service provides a speedier, more efficient and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  It is operated by the PRA and is available all year round.  I can further inform the Deputy that his query has been forwarded to the PRA for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 31 March 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why he should not be deported.His case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf by his legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 12 December 2008, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him.  Notice of this order was served by registered post which obliges the person concerned to leave the State.  The person concerned is required to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday 3 February 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.

In order to register they must produce a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.In the event that a person cannot produce a passport, the Garda National Immigration Bureau may seek to establish their identity by requesting the production of alternative documentation such as a driving licence, military service records, birth certificate, national ID card, residence permit, correspondence from Embassies or other official agencies.  The Somalian Embassy in Paris is the nearest diplomatic mission for Somalians living in Ireland.I am also informed that refugees seeking to bring family members into the State are required to produce passports of relevant family members when making an application for family reunification.  The passports are required for identification purposes and as part of the family reunification process to establish the relationship to the Somalian refugee who has made the application on their behalf.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	931	I propose to take Questions Nos. 715 and 717 together.I am informed that in response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report the Courts Service has implemented a number of key initiatives which address issues raised in it.  These initiatives include the nationwide deployment of the Criminal Case Tracking System (CCTS) to all District Court offices in 2004.  This System, which records the history of criminal cases from date of first court hearing to finalisation, facilitates the collection and production of improved management information in relation to the fines process.  The Courts Accounting System (CAS), which processes fine receipts, was piloted in 2007, and by end of 2008 it will have been deployed in 28 District Court Offices including all major urban centres.  The system will be fully deployed by mid 2009.  It provides a facility for payment of fines on line which has proven to be very successful and is increasing compliance.There have been significant benefits from these two strategic systems, including better management information on the collection of fines, more payment options, including the online payment facility, and more timely issue of fines notices and reminders.In 2007 the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a follow up report on fines collection and found that the payment rate had increased from 55% to 66%.  I am confident that the above initiatives, some of which were not in place at the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General's original report, will further contribute to an increase in the payment rate.I am further informed that as part of the latest upgrade to the Garda Pulse system applications for summonses by the Gardaí will be electronically routed to CCTS, which will issue summonses and electronically notify the Gardaí through Pulse of the court date and the outcome in due course.  This will result in savings to both organisations as well as enhancements to the accuracy of the Garda criminal records system.The Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) now covers the most significant offences in terms of road safety.  These include speeding, driving without insurance, non-wearing of safety belts, careless driving and using a mobile phone while driving.  In April 2006, the system was integrated with the Pulse system, enabling the linking of offences so that applications for a single summons for a number of offences can be generated.  FCPS has significantly enhanced management information and consequently the ability to monitor performance by reference to targets, timeliness and enforcement.  Fixed charge notices are being issued in a timely fashion with a file of newly recorded incidents being sent electronically on a daily basis to an external service provider who prints and issues notices the same day.  As a result of these developments, monitoring of the operation of FCPS has been much improved, thereby enabling An Garda Síochána to agree efficiency indicator targets including spoilage rates, the timeliness of the issue of notices and follow up to non-payment.I am also informed that responses received following a call for expressions of interest to outsource the collection of overdue court imposed fines with an option to extend this to fixed charge notices at a later date are currently in the process of being evaluated.  A detailed Request for Tender will issue to the candidates shortlisted in the near future.In addition, I intend to seek Government approval for a Fines Bill which will include provisions providing for the payment of fines by instalments and for an improved means of assessing the capacity of a person to pay a fine.  These proposals should further increase the rate of fine payment.Statistics of the kind sought by the Deputy are not readily available, particularly taking into account that there is inevitably a time lapse between a fine being imposed and its collection.

I will be in contact with the Deputy as soon as the information is to hand.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	933	I am currently preparing a Fines Bill and I intend to obtain Government approval for its publication in the near future. The Bill will include provisions dealing with the indexation of fines, payment of fines by instalment, equality of impact of fines imposed by the courts and the powers of the courts where a person does not pay a fines by its due date for payment.I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the most recent figures that are currently available for a complete year relate to 2007.  The number of persons committed to prison for the non-payment of fines in that year was 1,335, with the average period of sentence involved being 22 days per person.  However, a more accurate reflection of the prisoner population is found by examining the numbers being held in custody on any given day.  For example, on 21st January  2009 there were 21 persons in custody for non-payment of fines out of a total prisoner population of 3,714.  This amounts to 0.27% of the prisoner population on that day and clearly shows that persons imprisoned for non-payment of fines constitute an extremely small part of the prisoner population.

Garda management has been in contact with the Office of Public Works and electrical rewiring works to the station have been costed and approved. Preparatory work is currently underway and it is anticipated that work on the Station will commence by mid-February and will take approximately 3-4 months to complete.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	935	An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department on 14 December 2006.  Officials in that Section inform me that letters requesting further documentation have been sent to  the applicant on 29 October 2008, 10 December 2008 and 19 January 2009.  To date no reply has been received.   Further processing of the application will commence once the documentation requested has been received.  I should point out that if the person in question has changed address since lodging her application for naturalisation, she has an obligation to inform the Department accordingly.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	936	The person concerned arrived in the State on 29 July 2002 and applied for asylum on 14 August 2002. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 11 October 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.I should also mention that a person who has been refused refugee status and has been served with a notice of intention to deport is, since 10 October 2006, afforded a fourth option, viz. to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the person concerned, by letter dated 19 December 2006, was invited to make an application for Subsidiary Protection. By correspondence dated 12 January 2007, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by her legal representative. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The person concerned and her legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 16 January 2008.Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 13 January 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday 3 February 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.

I am informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that the person referred to by the Deputy made an application for family reunification on 26 September 2005 on behalf of her husband. She subsequently withdrew that application on 3 March 2006 and made a fresh  application in respect of her mother and brother.My Department forwarded the new application to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996.  This investigation was completed and the Commissioner submitted a report to my Department on 20 June 2006. Following the receipt of the report my Department issued a decision to the applicant on 27 July 2006 refusing the application because the subjects of the application did not qualify as dependents under Section 18(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996. Since the decision was issued further correspondence was received from the person in question and my Department replied to that correspondence on 5 August 2008.

One such condition is that the applicant must be of good character. An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in July 2005.  I decided to defer any final decision on the application for a period of twelve months until September, 2009, in order to be satisfied that the person concerned continues to be of good character.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	939	The immigration case histories and up to date positions of the two persons concerned, two sisters, are almost identical. As a result, for the purposes of the Deputy's Question, I will deal with the two cases as one.  Both of the persons concerned arrived in the State as unaccompanied minors on 16 October 2007. They were re-united with their adult sister who was residing in the State. They applied for asylum in the State on 23 January 2008.  Their respective asylum applications were refused following the individual consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. They chose not to pursue an appeal, to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), both of the persons concerned were informed, by letter dated 8 January 2009, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of deportation orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. In addition, they were notified of their entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).   To date no response has been received in my Department to above mentioned letters.The Deputy might wish to note that the 15 working day period referred to in my Department's letters of 8 January 2009, expires on the 29 January 2009.  It is open to both the persons concerned to make representations and/or apply for subsidiary protection within that period.  In any event, a final decision on this case will not be made prior to the expiry of the date above.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), he was informed, by letter dated 31 August 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain in the State. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

The application was forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996. The investigation has been completed and the Commissioner has forwarded a report to my Department.  The report will be considered by my Department and a decision on the application will issue in due course.  Applications are currently taking approximately 24 months to process.

Her son arrived in the State with her and he was included on her application. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 26 February 2002, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her son and herself.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned.The person concerned made an application for permission to remain in the State in accordance with the revised arrangements applicable to the non-EEA national parents of Irish born children, born in the State before 1 January 2005 on the basis of her custody of her Irish born grandchild. The revised arrangements in question, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 Scheme, were announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 15 January 2005. The person concerned was notified by letter dated 5 October 2005 that her application for permission to remain on that basis was refused, as she was not the legal guardian of the child in question.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 24 August 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered  before the file is passed to me for decision.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	946	The St. Andrews Agreement 2006 included a commitment to bring forward an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland, reflecting on the experience in Wales and our own experience in Ireland. It also called on the incoming Northern Ireland Executive to work to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language. The British legislation giving effect to the St. Andrews Agreement included a specific requirement on the Executive to adopt a strategy setting out how it proposed to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.Upon restoration of devolution in May 2007, the enhancement and protection of the Irish language in Northern Ireland became a devolved matter for consideration by the parties in the Executive. My colleague Minister Ó Cuív has discussed progress in this regard with his counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Mr. Gregory Campbell MLA, and his predecessor, Mr. Edwin Poots MLA, within the framework of the North South Ministerial Council.  Within the Northern Ireland Assembly I am aware that Minister Campbell gave an initial briefing to the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure last December on his plans for an ‘Indigenous or Regional Minority Language Strategy' and I look forward to further progress on this initiative.The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. This issue has been raised in discussions which my predecessor, Mr. Dermot Ahern T.D., and I have had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Shaun Woodward MP.  The Government remains fully committed to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and St Andrews Agreement, including the provisions relating to the Irish Language.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	947	I am committed to undertaking a number of foreign trips in the next four months.  I plan to visit Syria and Lebanon in early February. The visit will provide the opportunity to meet with leading political figures and deepen and extend our political and commercial contacts in both countries. I will also be meeting with members of the Irish community in Syria, and I will also visit the UNIFIL HQ at Naqoura in the south of the country.I should also point out that, with the renewed efforts to promote a comprehensive regional peace settlement in the Middle East, Syria and Lebanon have assumed even more importance in the context of the peace process. Turkish-mediated dialogue between Syria and Israel has been underway for a number of months now, though it is currently suspended due to the Gaza conflict. Meetings with senior political figures in both countries will therefore provide an excellent opportunity to hear, at first-hand, Syrian and Lebanese thinking on current regional peace efforts and how to advance them.Deputies will also be aware of Ireland's long-standing connection with Lebanon and the significant role which Irish peacekeepers have played in maintaining peace in the country since 1978. The visit to Lebanon will provide an opportunity to take stock of Lebanon's own political reconstruction, as well as to witness the excellent work still being carried out by UNIFIL and the small group of Irish officers stationed there.I will visit Mexico and Cuba at the end of February. Programmes for these visits are being developed but meetings with the Mexican Foreign Minister and my Cuban counterpart are confirmed. I am visiting Mexico to underpin the strong economic and political relationship which exists between our two countries. As regards Cuba, this will be the first visit by a Minister of Foreign Affairs from Ireland to that country. It will take place at an important juncture in the development of Cuba's relations with the European Union and in the internal development of Cuba.In addition to the regular meetings of the Council of Ministers, there are a number of regional meetings of EU Foreign Ministers, which I am currently scheduled to attend, which are:(i) Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Hanoi, Vietnam, 25-26 May;(ii) EU-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, 27-28 May; and(iii) EU-Rio Group (Latin American and Caribbean) in Prague, Czech Republic, 13-14 May.A number of other visits are currently under consideration but no final decisions have yet been taken.

It is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than my own Department which has primary responsibility for visa and immigration policy. Further details as to how someone ordinarily resident in Belfast should apply for a visa are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform at www.inis.gov.ie .
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	950	In 2005, the Government decided that, building on the existing free transport, television licence, phone and electricity schemes for older people, passports should also be available free to persons aged 65 and over. This attractive scheme was widely and warmly welcomed. The reality is that, for a scheme such as this to work satisfactorily, there clearly has to be a fixed starting date and fixed qualifications for persons to benefit under it. In addition, and unless a passport holder has immediate travel plans, new passports do not have to be applied for on, or be valid from, the date when the previous passport expired.  In view of the above, I do not consider that it is necessary or appropriate to make any changes to the scheme.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	951	Ireland is one of the strongest supporters of the Fair Trade movement internationally. The objective of the Government's assistance is to enable small farmers and producers in developing countries to obtain a fair price for their produce, invest premiums to improve quality and capacity, promote employment and fund social improvements that benefit the broader community.Irish Aid, the Government's programme of assistance to the developing world, has supported the Irish Fair Trade Network since 2002, with funding allocations of €23.8 million agreed for the ten-year period 2002-2012. This includes €7.5 million agreed in 2006 for a five-year programme of support to producers in Central America which is overseen by the Irish Fair Trade Network. It also includes a grant of €15 million last year for a similar programme in Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda.  Irish Aid has also provided considerable assistance for the development education work of the Irish Fair Trade Network. Last year, funding over three years was awarded to the Network for an awareness-raising programme which will build on its successful Fairtrade Fortnight and Fairtrade Towns initiatives.The Department of Foreign Affairs has recently received correspondence from students at a school in Dublin requesting that funding be provided to the Irish Fair Trade Network to allow the introduction of a Fairtrade Flag scheme for schools. This is an interesting, creative proposal. As it is primarily a matter for the Network to consider in the context of its campaigning strategy, I have arranged for a copy of the correspondence received from the school to be forwarded to them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	952	The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland. A search of my Department's records of overflight and landing requests for foreign military aircraft since 1 January 2006 has revealed no request related to traffic by foreign military aircraft of the type described by the Deputy.  The regulation of the transport of munitions of war by civil aircraft is, on the other hand, primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport.  There were no requests for the shipment of munitions of war for use by the Government of Israel in the period to which the Deputy refers.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	953	No decision has been taken by the EU Council of Ministers since 2002 to reduce the number of members of the European Commission.  The Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003 following ratification by all Member States, provides that when the European Union consists of 27 Member States:The number of Members of the Commission shall be less than the number of Member States. The Members of the Commission shall be chosen according to a rotation system based on the principle of equality, the implementing arrangements for which shall be adopted by the Council, acting unanimously.  The number of Members of the Commission shall be set by the Council, acting unanimously.On 1 January 2007, membership of the European Union reached 27 Member States with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.   The Treaty of Lisbon, which was signed by the Heads of State and Government of the Member States on 13 December 2007, provides that: as from 1 November 2014, the Commission shall consist of a number of members, including its President and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, corresponding to two thirds of the number of Member States, unless the European Council, acting unanimously, decides to alter this number.Following the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon in June of last year, the Government commissioned in-depth research into the reasons underlying the people's vote.  This revealed a number of issues of key concern, including the composition of the Commission.  The Government entered into intensive discussions with EU partner Member States aimed at identifying how these concerns could be addressed.  At its meeting of 11/12 December 2008, the European Council agreed that all the concerns identified shall be addressed to the mutual satisfaction of Ireland and the other Member States.On the Commission, in particular, it agreed that: provided the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, a decision will be taken, in accordance with the necessary legal procedures, to the effect that the Commission shall continue to include one national of each Member State.  The European Council reached this agreement in a spirit of solidarity and compromise, despite the well-established position of a number of Member States favouring a smaller Commission.  It represents a significant negotiating achievement by the Government.As a result of this agreement, it is possible to secure the right of each Member State to continue to nominate a Commissioner only if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force.  If the Lisbon Treaty does not enter into force, the current Treaties require that the size of the Commission will be reduced from November of this year, when a new Commission, the first to be appointed since membership of the European Union reached 27 Member States, is due to take office.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	954	As the Deputy will appreciate, requirements for permission to enter the United States are a matter for the United States authorities.  The P-1 non immigrant visa enables non-US citizens or non-US permanent residents, who are professional athletes, artists or entertainers to enter the US for a specific competition or performance.  For detailed information, it would be best to contact the Visa Section of the United States Embassy, telephone 01 6688777, or website, www.usembassy.ie for guidance on what are the requirements for obtaining a P-1 visa to travel to the US.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	955	My Department is fully compliant with the Department of Finance guidelines on foreign travel.  My Department also operates its own internal travel guidelines and practises which ensure cost effective travel practises, both in Headquarters and throughout our network of 75 diplomatic missions abroad.  The central aims of the travel policy, which embraces both Ministers and officials, are to minimise official travel costs and to achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.In 2008, the estimated total cost of foreign travel undertaken by my Department, was €5,966,736.  Of this overall figure, €3,862,380 was incurred by officers based in Ireland on official travel abroad, with expenditure of €2,104,356 incurred by Missions abroad either on travel within countries of their accreditation  many Ambassadors while resident in one country are accredited to two, three or more other countries — or on returning to Ireland on official business.  The foreign travel costs incurred within the Irish Aid budget, which involves in particular travel to, and within, developing countries in Africa, including for audit purposes, account for over a third of the overall travel expenditure for my Department.The Department's travel budget, as provided for in the Estimates, will reflect an 11% reduction in 2009 over 2008. In light of this, I have asked my officials to undertake a further review of current travel policies to identify even greater cost efficiencies, where possible, while ensuring continued satisfactory representation of Ireland overseas.  There are no State Agencies operating under the remit of my Department.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	957	The overarching goal of the Government's aid programme, administered by Irish Aid, is the reduction and eventual eradication of global poverty and hunger.  Our partnership with development Non-Governmental Organisations represents a very important element of this effort. Irish Aid engages with NGOs through the Multi Annual Programme Scheme (MAPS), the Civil Society Fund and a number of Emergency funding schemes. It also cooperates closely with Misean Cara, representing Irish missionaries working with the poor in the developing world.Currently, five major NGOs receive support multi-annual programme support from the Government, which amounted in total to over €70m last year.  These are Concern, Trócaire, Goal, Christian Aid and Self Help Africa.  The funding supports the NGOs' work in livelihood and food security, rural economic development, health, education, gender equality and the fight against HIV/AIDS.The Irish Aid Civil Society Fund is open to all Irish-based Non-Governmental Organisations and is designed to provide resources for the development activities of civil society organisations. In 2008, over €40m was allocated to NGOs under the Fund.  Multi-annual block grant funding arrangements have been in place for a number of years with Oxfam, Action Aid Ireland, World Vision Ireland and the Irish Fairtrade Network.  During 2008, new block grant funding agreements were reached with seventeen other NGOs.  These agreements will involve the provision of some €36 million in funding over three years to support the development programmes of the NGOs.  The participating agencies include AidLink, Christian Blind Mission, Children in Crossfire, Frontline, Plan Ireland, Progressio Ireland, SightSavers International, War on Want Northern Ireland, Vita and VSO Ireland.In total, Irish Aid's Civil Society Fund, Micro-Project Scheme, Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund and Emergency Preparedness and Post-Emergency Recovery Fund provide funding to over 200 organisations. The Government also provides funding to Misean Cara to support the work of Irish missionaries and their partners worldwide. Misean Cara received €20m from Irish Aid in 2008.Our partnership with NGOs goes beyond funding arrangements and involves a continuous policy dialogue across a range of areas.  The strength of the Irish NGO sector reflects the continuing commitment of the Irish people to the alleviation of poverty and hunger among the poorest people in the world.  I believe it is essential that the Government and the NGOs continue to work in partnership to ensure the effectiveness of Ireland's overall contribution to the developing world and to highlight development issues publicly.

The programme is administered by the Development Co-operation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, also known as Irish Aid. Further contributions to ODA are made by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Co-operation Budget.The figures requested by the Deputy for the years 2000-2008 together with the provisional outturn for 2008 are set out in tabular form as follows:YearVote 29Other ODATotal€m€m€m2000170852552001236843202002343794222003372744462004396934892005465113578200659521981420077261458712008769130*899**Estimated Outturn.For 2009 the Government has allocated €891 million to ODA, though as with all expenditure this is subject to review.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	960	The overarching objective of the Government's official aid programme is to make an effective contribution to the fight against global poverty and hunger.  It is important that all of our development policies and project activities are measured against their contribution to the reduction of poverty and towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.Through Irish Aid, the Government currently provides assistance to over ninety countries in the developing world, with a strong focus on the least developed countries in Africa.  Of these, nine have been designated as Programme Countries, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  They are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda, Vietnam and Timor Leste. The Government has identified four cross-cutting priorities for Irish Aid's programmes and project activities: the environment, gender, good governance and HIV and AIDS.  In response to the report of the Government's Hunger Task Force, particular priority will be given to the fight against hunger and food insecurity, which must be a cornerstone of the overall aid programme.Ireland's overseas development assistance focuses on the provision of basic social services for the poorest people in the developing world as well as on vital humanitarian relief and response to emergencies.  Support is provided through a wide range of partners, including Governments, non-governmental organisations, and UN and other multilateral development agencies.Detailed information on projects supported by Irish Aid and on the impact of the funding is set out in the Irish Aid Annual Report.  It is worth citing a number of examples.  We are working with the Government of Uganda to improve access to primary and secondary education.  For instance, Irish Aid is supporting the expansion of eleven secondary schools and two teacher training colleges in Karamoja, Uganda's poorest and most deprived region.  So far, over 600 children, two-thirds of them girls, have also benefited from bursaries to enable them to attend secondary school.  In Mozambique and Lesotho, Irish Aid is working in partnership with the Clinton Foundation and the Ministries of Health to provide access to anti-retroviral treatment for HIV and AIDS and to support prevention and counselling initiatives.  In Zambia, Irish Aid is supporting non-governmental organisations working with vulnerable children, helping them to access health services, continue their schooling and undertake vocational training.I am confident that Ireland's assistance is making a tangible difference to the lives of the poorest people in the developing world. For instance, in Lesotho, where Ireland is the largest donor, there has been a 32% reduction in the mortality rate of children under five since 1990. Irish Aid support in Uganda has contributed to an increase in primary school enrolment from 2.4 million in 1997 to 7 million in 2008.  In Tanzania, a clean water programme supported by Irish Aid resulted in the eradication of cases of cholera in Dar es Salaam in 2007.  These examples underline the effectiveness of the aid programme and the importance of maintaining our commitment to working in partnership with the people and Governments of the developing world.

While the main Headquarters (Iveagh House) is owned by the State, the majority of these buildings are leased by the Office of Public Works. Costs relating to Constituency Office staff form part of the wider accommodation expenditure for the Department as a whole and it is therefore not possible to assign a specific figure for these charges.  In the time available, it is not possible to provide precise information in relation to the travel, subsistence and overtime expenses attributed to the above constituency staff. However, I can confirm that any such expenses would be processed in full compliance with the standard Civil Service regulations governing overtime, travel and subsistence.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	963	As the Deputy will be aware, President Obama on 22 January signed four Executive Orders concerning the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and related matters. I warmly welcome this decisive and immediate move by the President.  As I said in my immediate reaction to the news, it represents an historic new beginning in efforts to uphold and promote human rights, and will be welcomed by all friends of the United States.  The relevant Executive Order states that Guantanamo is to close within one year, and that appropriate arrangements will need to be made to deal with the remaining detainees, either by prosecuting them, returning them to their home countries, releasing them or transferring them to a third country.  The Executive Order directs the Secretary of State to seek international co-operation aimed at achieving the transfers of detainees.Ireland, with our EU partners, has consistently called for the closure of Guantanamo and the bringing to trial or release of detainees held there.  At yesterday's meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council Foreign Ministers held an initial discussion of how European Union Member States might approach the issue, and strongly welcomed President Obama's move.  However, it is clear that there is a range of complex legal, practical and political issues to be worked through, primarily on the US side in the first instance. Nevertheless, I made clear that Ireland is ready in this new context to examine how we may be supportive of the United States Government as it proceeds towards the closure of Guantanamo. While any decisions on resettlement are for each Member State to take individually, plainly a co-ordinated EU approach would be highly desirable.With the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whose Department has responsibility for the reception and integration of citizens of third countries, I will keep the matter under review and as necessary we will bring any specific proposals to Government.  There have as yet been no approaches from the new US administration on the matter, but I expect that it will feature in our future dialogue with it.  Last year there were some discussions with the US authorities at official level in my Department and in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the possible acceptance by Ireland of detainees.  There were also been informal contacts with interested parties and lawyers representing one of these detainees. However, with President Obama's decision last Thursday the context has clearly changed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	964	The Government is strongly committed to trying to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States.  The fact that President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and other senior members of the new Administration have for some time been strong supporters of comprehensive immigration reform and of the undocumented Irish is very encouraging.  Since the new year, there have also been helpful public indications that Senate Majority Leader, Senator Harry Reid, and Senator John McCain intend to support action in this area.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, the issue remains politically divisive in the US Congress and making progress will be challenging.The pursuit of a solution for the undocumented will be a key element of our early contact with the new US Administration and Congress.  The St. Patrick's Day period presents an ideal opportunity to engage the new Administration on this issue at the very highest level.  Our Ambassador in Washington will also attach the highest priority to the matter in his ongoing contacts with the Obama Administration.  More broadly, the Government is working to reform our overall migration arrangements with the United States.  In addition to our work on behalf of the undocumented, the Government recently concluded a new Working Holiday Agreement with the United States and is working to secure the passage of legislation which would enable Irish citizens to avail of the E3 working visa currently open to Australians.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	965	I condemn unreservedly the murders on 19 January of Stanislav Markelov and Anastasiya Baburova.  They were shot in broad daylight on a busy Moscow street. Mr Markelov died at the scene while Ms Baburova died later in hospital.  Mr Markelov was a noted lawyer and human rights defender who was particularly engaged in championing the cause of human rights victims in Chechnya.  Ms Baburova was a young journalist working with Novaya Gazeta, the respected newspaper for which journalist Anna Politkovskaya worked before her murder in 2006.Sadly, this is only the latest in a long string of attacks on human rights defenders, journalists and NGO activists in the Russian Federation. Such attacks are intended to demoralise and strike fear into those who strive to create a vibrant and free civil society. The Russian Federation must ensure that such voices in society can be heard without risk of violent attack.  The EU has sent its condolences to the families of Mr Markelov and Ms Baburova and has called on the Russian authorities to ensure a thorough, prompt and impartial investigation to bring all the perpetrators to justice. I fully support this call.Ireland has always taken a strong interest in the position of Human Rights Defenders world –wide and will take the opportunity of the examination of Russia at the UN Universal Periodic Review next week to ask how it intends to enhance protection for human rights defenders and improve investigations where attacks on human rights defenders have occurred.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	966	Following the declaration of the December European Council demanding the immediate release of people held incommunicado in Zimbabwe, specifically including Ms. Jestina Mukoko, a prominent human rights activist who visited Ireland in May 2008, I was relieved to learn, on Christmas Eve, that Ms. Mukoko had been located in police custody, after three weeks during which her whereabouts were unknown.Ms. Mukoko remains in custody, and I am gravely concerned by allegations that she has been tortured. The accusations against Ms. Mukoko — a plan to bomb Harare's Central police station and a "plot" to violently topple Mugabe through the training of militants in neighbouring Botswana — are clearly not credible. I am very disturbed by the refusal of the Zimbabwean authorities to allow Ms. Mukoko and her colleagues access to legal and medical assistance.Ireland and the EU had made strong representations to the Zimbabwean authorities in relation to Ms. Mukoko's disappearance. At the General Affairs and External Relations Council yesterday, we condemned the ongoing violations of human rights, including the abduction and detention of those exercising a democratic right to express opposition to the regime and of those defending human rights. Irish officials will continue to work to ensure that this issue remains high on the EU agenda.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	967	I propose to take Questions Nos. 766, 767, 770, 771, 775 and 776 together.The December meeting of the European Council agreed that the concerns of the Irish people regarding the Lisbon Treaty, as set out by the Taoiseach, "shall be addressed to the mutual satisfaction of Ireland and other Member States". Specifically, the European Council agreed that, provided the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, each Member State will continue to have the right to nominate a Commissioner. It agreed that legal guarantees will be given to Ireland in the areas of taxation, defence and certain sensitive issues covered by our Constitution, namely the right to life, education and family. It also agreed that the high importance the EU attaches to issues including workers' rights and social services will be confirmed.  This represents a very clear and a very positive response to the concerns expressed by the Irish people during our referendum campaign.Much detailed work will now be done in taking these commitments forward, especially in preparing the form and content of the legal guarantees. The Government has said that if, and only if, it is satisfied with the outcome of this work, it will seek ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by the end of the term of the current Commission, which is expected to leave office at the end of October.In the months ahead, the Government will be working domestically, with our EU partners and with the EU institutions to give effect to these commitments. We will be aiming to conclude this work no later than mid-2009.   We will not be taking any decision on the holding of a second referendum, including on its timing, until the concerns of the Irish people have been addressed to our full satisfaction, and it is therefore pointless to speculate about what might happen after a possible future referendum. It is a matter of national priority to secure Ireland's future at the heart of the European Union where our interests can best be served.At this stage, 23 of our EU partners have ratified the Lisbon Treaty and a further two Member States have substantially ratified the Treaty. We respect the right of all Member States to proceed with their national ratification procedures, in accordance with their own constitutional traditions.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	968	The overarching objective of Irish Aid, the Government's official aid programme, is the reduction of poverty, inequality and exclusion in developing countries. The White Paper on Irish Aid sets out the principles and policies underlying the aid programme. It also identifies considerations which guide the selection of long term development partners. These include factors such as the level of poverty and the scope for Ireland to make a positive impact. It also includes standards of governance, stability and the potential of the partner government to take ownership of the country's development process.In keeping with the conclusions of the White Paper on Irish Aid, Africa, with 34 of the world's least developed countries, will remain the primary geographic focus for Ireland's development programme. Seven of the nine programme countries are in sub-Saharan Africa. These are Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia and Malawi. The other two programme countries are Vietnam and East Timor.Irish Aid is committed to ensuring that all aid goes to those for whom it is intended, and has rigorous planning, monitoring and evaluation measures in place. The poorest in society are those most affected by corruption. We are addressing corruption through improving transparency and accountability in Government, supporting public oversight institutions, parliamentary reform and the independent media. Additionally, we support building the capacity of civil society to influence and monitor public policy decisions. For example, in Lesotho and Mozambique, Ireland supports the strengthening of internal and external audit functions within the Government. In Uganda, Ireland is supporting the promotion of democracy, political parties and civic education in the lead up to the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2011. In Zambia, Ireland supports the work of a special Task Force on Corruption.Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls which are essential to ensuring a transparent, effective and high quality programme. Irish Aid programmes are regularly and intensively audited and evaluated by independent audit firms, by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit, including internal auditors based in our programme countries, and also overseen by the independent Audit Committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Programmes are evaluated to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended, in particular in respect of outcomes and value for money.While we are working in some of the most difficult environments in the world, I am satisfied that the monitoring, evaluation and audit systems which we have in place provide the best protection possible against misuse of Irish taxpayers' funds.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	969	With the terrible situations in Zimbabwe, Sudan, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) foremost in our minds, the task of finding durable solutions to the problems of conflict, hunger and human rights abuses in Africa is one of the most pressing facing the EU and the UN. Poverty, inequality and exclusion are fertile breeding grounds for violence and ethnic hatred. Most wars occur in poor countries, and the causes and effect of conflict are exacerbated by poverty. In recognising the inter-related nature of these problems, the EU and the UN have formulated policies towards Africa that have at their core poverty reduction, good governance and the promotion of peace.The EU has made human rights and democracy a central aspect of its external action, in its political dialogue with African countries under the Cotonou Agreement, through its development assistance programmes, and through targeted funding for human rights and democracy projects. Participation in UN and other multilateral fora, such as the Human Rights Council, is an important channel for EU-Africa dialogue on human rights issues.UN-authorised peacekeeping missions have a major role in stabilising former and current conflict zones in Africa, not least the EU-led military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR Tchad/RCA, in which the Irish contingent is playing a prominent role. The first EU naval mission, Operation Atalanta, is currently deployed off the coast of Somalia to tackle piracy, and as a result, enough food aid for one million people has been delivered safely to Somali ports. The EU and the UN strongly support, both financially and politically, many peace mediation efforts in Africa, notably in Darfur and in the Great Lakes region.The development deficit in Africa requires concerted action and long-term solutions, and, in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the UN, EU and African governments have signed up to an ambitious programme.  The EU is Africa's largest donor, providing more than 50% of development aid to the continent. Africa is, of course, at the heart of Ireland's programme of development assistance. Recognising that famine and conflict are more likely where political and administrative systems are weak, Irish Aid supports specific actions to promote political stability, and good governance. The eradication of hunger is a cornerstone of Irish Aid's strategy, and the Government has recently announced the appointment of a Special Envoy for Hunger.EU and UN efforts cannot, alone, find enduring solutions to African problems. Lasting peace and prosperity will require African initiative and responsibility, and in this respect the African Union represents an important partner for the EU and the UN. The EU has supported the development of African-led peacekeeping in Darfur and elsewhere through its African Peace Facility. Peace, governance and development were among the themes discussed by European and African leaders at the EU-Africa Summit in 2007, when they agreed a comprehensive EU-Africa Strategy to address these and other challenges.The problems facing Africa can seem insurmountable. But this would be an inaccurate and unjust portrayal of the continent. Many African economies are growing. The work of the International Criminal Court marks a real effort to end impunity for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. There are exceptions, but many African countries are now experiencing less conflict than has been the case for many years. There is relative peace in Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia and Angola, although international engagement remains crucial. Ireland, the EU and the UN are dedicated to combating hunger, conflict and human rights abuses, and together we continue to make a lasting difference in the lives of Africans.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	970	Croatia hopes to conclude its accession negotiations in 2009. A road map proposed by the Commission in its annual assessment sets out the way for their conclusion, provided Croatia makes the required progress on the outstanding issues. These include privatising shipyards; judicial reform; organised crime; minority rights; and cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  To date, Croatia has opened 22 of the 35 chapters of the negotiations, of which 7 have been provisionally closed. A dispute with Slovenia over maritime and land borders has blocked the opening of a further eleven chapters to date, but I hope that the two sides can find a way to resolving the issue so that the accession negotiations are not adversely affected.Negotiations with Turkey are also proceeding, albeit at a slow pace. Of the thirty five negotiating chapters, ten are now open, of which one has been provisionally closed. In its 2008 assessment of Turkey's preparations for accession, the Commission calls on Turkey to reinvigorate the process of political reform. It states that significant further reforms are needed in particular on amending the rules governing political parties; freedom of expression and freedom of religion; and to establish an ombudsman function. In the Commission's view, further progress is also needed in other areas such as judicial reform, the fight against corruption, gender equality, minority rights and the civilian control of the military and to bring the legislation on trade unions into line with ILO and EU standards. The Progress Report makes it clear that the pace of the accession negotiations will reflect the pace of reform as well as Turkey's fulfilment of the necessary conditions for membership.The EU continues to work closely with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on its preparations to open accession negotiations. Elections are due to be held there in March and the international judgement on these elections is likely to influence the Commission's progress report in November.  On 15 December, Montenegro submitted its application to join the European Union. The next step will be to place this application on the agenda of the European Council and it is up to the Presidency to decide when to do this.Ireland has always supported the European perspective of the countries of the Western Balkans as laid out in the Conclusions of the European Council at Thessaloniki in 2003. The accession negotiations are a complex and open-ended process whose outcome cannot be predetermined. In the wake of the accession of twelve new Member States and the likely accession of Croatia in the next two years, a period of consolidation and adjustment is needed. In the Western Balkans, the focus should be on encouraging the candidate countries in their reform programmes in order to bring them closer to the EU.

The Convention opened for signature on 30 March 2007. Ireland signed the Convention, subject to ratification, on that date. The Convention entered into force on 3 May 2008, having been ratified by twenty countries.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr Dermot Ahern T.D., has lead responsibility for issues relating to the implementation of the Convention and his Department chairs an Interdepartmental Implementation Committee established in 2007. It is my understanding that it is the intention to complete all implementing measures as quickly as possible.The Department of Foreign Affairs already takes account of the requirements under Article 32 (International Relations) of the Convention in the implementation of Ireland's overseas development aid policy. Irish Aid policies and programmes fully recognise the inter-relationship between poverty and disability and are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities.  In due course, when all the required implementation arrangements are in place, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will request me to seek Government authority to ratify the Convention.

These, in order of progress, are: Feasibility Study/Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  The Department and its technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation. The Preliminary Report for the Ballybofey/Stranorlar Swimming Pool Project was approved in May 2007.  The Contract Documents were submitted to the Department in late 2008 and were forwarded to the Office of Public Works for evaluation.  The OPW has now approved these documents and I am pleased to state that I have decided that approval be granted to Donegal County Council to prepare tender documentation for the project.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	974	I propose to take Questions Nos. 780 to 798, inclusive, together.The accompanying schedule lists each of the relevant tourism commitments and the progress made in advancing them by the Department and the bodies under its aegis.The provision of €300 million to assist the industry, tourism agencies and local authorities in delivering the ambitious world-class product outlined in Fáilte Ireland's Tourism Product Development Strategy 2007-2013. Progress to date:An allocation of €11 million has been provided in 2009 to support, by way of grants through Fáilte Ireland, investment in tourism infrastructure, attractions and activity products.  A PPP funding commitment has also been provided for the construction and operation of the National Conference Centre in Spencer Dock in Dublin during the period up to 2013.Initially, Fáilte Ireland primarily targeted infrastructure provision (e.g., walking and cycling routes, beach management works, access to angling waters etc) by local authorities.  Over the period 2007 and 2008, grants totalling over €25.6 million were announced for expenditure on tourism infrastructure projects around the country.  Separately, grants totalling almost €2.2 million were approved in September 2008 under Fáilte Ireland's Historic Towns Initiative, for the further development of historic walking trails in 35 towns around the country.As the Plan continues, the focus of the investment has moved towards investment in Visitor Attractions and the expansion of various commercial Visitor Activities.  This programme is known as the Tourism Capital Investment Programme (TCIP), and applications for funding were invited before the end of April 2008.  This Programme provides support for the development of major visitor attractions and visitor activities. To date, grants totalling almost €12.5million have been announced for the redevelopment of projects.1. Place much greater emphasis on the protection, conservation, interpretation and access to Ireland's natural and built heritage. Progress to date:Issues around protection, conservation, interpretation and access to Ireland's natural and built heritage are a key part of Fáilte Ireland's Tourism Product Development Strategy 2007-2013, which itself was subject to an environmental assessment.  Specific actions are scheduled to be rolled out as appropriate.  Under the Tourism Capital Investment Programme (TCIP), investment in natural and built heritage visitor attractions concentrates on bringing alive and improving visitor appeal, as well as improving visitor access to sites.  Fáilte Ireland has published its Environmental Action Plan, which provides a framework for its work in sustainable tourism development over the period 2007-2009.Environmental conservation and sustainable design provisions have been incorporated into the guidelines for the assessment of projects under the mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Scheme, which was launched by An Taoiseach in June, 2008.  Environmental Good Practice Guidelines have been agreed between Fáilte Ireland and the Irish Boat Rental Association for their members.  Environmental guidelines are currently being prepared (in association with the GUI and GCSAI) for the management of golf courses.2. Deepen North/South cooperation in tourism, building in particular on the success of Tourism Ireland as a dynamic and innovative cross-Border body leading the way on mutually advantageous all-island economic co-operation. Progress to date:North South co-operation on tourism has been ongoing for a number of years and continues on a regular basis between the relevant Departments North and South and the respective tourism agencies.  Tourism Ireland markets the island of Ireland as a holiday destination in over 20 markets across the world. Northern Ireland is presented prominently in all of Tourism Ireland's global destination marketing campaigns which reach a potential audience worldwide of 200 million each year.North South Ministerial Council Tourism Sectoral Meetings were held on 8th November 2007 in Dublin Castle and 29th May 2008 in Enniskillen. A further meeting will be held in the coming months. At the November 2007 meeting agreement was reached on Tourism Ireland's Business Plan for 2008 and Corporate Plan for the period 2008-2010. The May 2008 meeting approved Tourism Ireland's proposal to open a new and developing markets hub office to service markets such as India and China and also discussed the scope for further co-operation on tourism statistics.The Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) launched a call for suitable projects under INTERREG IVA during 2008. It is expected that about €30m (including match funding) will be available for tourism projects during the period to 2013 under INTERREG IVA. The call for suitable projects is now closed and consideration of applications by SEUPB is at an advanced stage with a number of projects approved by SEUPB's steering committee and forwarded to accountable Departments for their approval.3. Establish, through Fáilte Ireland, an innovation fund to promote and support the development of tourism products that are new to the Irish market and to promote best practice, particularly in terms of environmental sustainability and accessibility for tourists with disabilities.  Progress to date:Through its Environment Unit, established in 2006, Fáilte Ireland has been promoting environmental sustainability in a number of areas.  Environmental good practice guidelines for festivals and events, and cruising have been published and grant applicants for the Festivals and Cultural Events Initiative are asked to state what they have done to make the event more environmentally sustainable. A copy of the environmental guidelines are issued with every grant application form.Environmental guidelines are currently being prepared for the golf sector and for business tourism, both of which will be published later in 2009.  Fáilte Ireland is also a partner of the Leave No Trace network which promotes responsible use of the countryside and the application of this code of practice is attached as a condition to a number of relevant grant-aided projects that involve use of natural areas for recreation.A review of all tourism and hospitality education and training courses delivered throughout the State has just been completed by Fáilte Ireland to ascertain the current level of sustainability content in these courses.  This has resulted in the publication of a comprehensive guideline document which recommends improved sustainability content in each of these courses.During 2009, Fáilte Ireland plans to liaise with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in undertaking a review of its grant aid procedures insofar as they affect Natura 2000 sites to ensure that any grant applications which may involve a Natura 2000 are adequately and appropriately assessed.  Also, an Innovation Fund was launched in 2008 to offer assistance in respect of feasibility studies for innovative tourism products.  A number of feasibility studies for new products have been supported under this Fund.4. Develop with Fáilte Ireland, rural-based package-style holidays through which B & B owners and Farm Holiday operators can offer activities such as walking, angling, golfing and cycling in addition to the provision of accommodation and quality home-cooked meals.  Progress to date:The development of theme-based package-style holidays with bed and breakfast owners and farm holiday operators will be informed and directed by the recommendations contained in the Irish Homes Bed and Breakfast working group report. The group included representatives of the B&B sector as well as officials from both Fáilte Ireland and the Northern Irish Tourist Board.  The group concluded its work in December 2008. The main recommendations to help grow and develop the sector in the challenging times ahead concern the areas of licensing, classification and categorisation.  An implementation group will be established shortly to oversee the execution of the report's recommendations.  Currently, Fáilte Ireland is working with seven angling hubs, six walking hubs and two food hubs to help develop links with bed and breakfast owners and farm holiday operators in order to develop rural-based package style holidays.Irish Home Operators are being encouraged to become members of regional activity hubs. To date an adventure hub has been established in Cork/Kerry, a family-friendly hub in the South East, a rural activity hub in the Glen of Aherlow, a salmon centre of excellence in Ballina and a cultural hub in the Western islands of Inishturk, Inishbofin & Clare Island. A further heritage initiative in the Boyne Valley area is at the early stages of development.Over the last year, Fáilte Ireland has financed a €0.5 million programme of marketing and support for the small accommodation sector which has focused on the development and enhancement of e-Business capability and providing operators with supports to target and develop new business. This has resulted in significant investment in websites, booking systems, search engine marketing campaigns and targeted promotions in key trade and consumer events.5. Develop a rolling programme of national culture, musical and literary festivals to enhance the Irish tourism product, in particular through the establishment of a new fund of €28 million for the creation of a small number of major annual events over the period to 2013.  Progress to date :Fáilte Ireland is committed to continued support for a number of key festivals under the Festivals and Cultural Events Initiative, the primary aim of which is to encourage the spatial spread of visitors throughout the country by strategically investing in attractive and sustainable festivals and cultural events that enhance the local tourism product and in turn expand regional tourism.Fáilte Ireland, under the Festivals and Culture Events Initiative, has supported over 400 festivals and events through an investment in excess of €25 million during the six years 2002-2008.  In this period, festivals and events which received funding, attracted over seven million people.  In 2009 a further €3.35 million has been committed to larger festivals under the national programme and an estimated €900,000 will be invested in smaller festivals at regional level which are deemed to showcase Ireland's cultural offering and support the development of tourism in that area.Festivals supported include a wide range of musical, multi-disciplinary arts festivals, literary festivals and other cultural festivals. Fáilte Ireland is committed to supporting existing festivals and cultural events as well as seeking out new opportunities for the creation of new festivals where necessary and which are deemed to have the potential to drive tourism to that area.  The Arts Council has committed €2,463,000 to Multi-disciplinary festivals in 2009.   An additional €925,000 has been allocated to the Small Festival Scheme. In addition, the Arts Council is providing €823,000 to Street Arts and Spectacle organisations..6. Work with Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to capitalise on the beauty of the Irish countryside and promote Ireland as a healthy activity holiday destination for walking, cycling, angling, golfing, sailing, equestrian and marine holidays.  Progress to date:Substantial investment has been made to date to capitalise on the beauty of the Irish countryside and assist in promoting Ireland as a healthy activity holiday destination.  Over 334 projects have been supported during 2007 & 2008. These have covered a wide variety of products to suit all potential visitor needs. These include:The development of 106 walks in association with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Walks have been developed to suit all level of walkers and they vary from one-day loops and long-distance hikes, to national parks, forest walks, pilgrim paths and slí na sláinte routes.  In addition, Fáilte Ireland supports many walking festivals e.g. The Táin Walking Festival and Castlebar International Four Days' Walks Festival.The development and completion of cycling hubs in Achill, Westport, Mullingar & Skibbereen.  Work is also in progress on cycle trails at numerous locations, including Doolin, the Glen of Aherlow and on the Great Southern Trail.Substantial investment in the areas of beach and water management, particularly for products like cruising and angling with pump-outs, moorings, signage, carparks, shower facilities, disabled access toilet facilities, disabled angling stands, boat washdown areas, footbridges etc. all developed to provide a better experience for the visitor.Investment in the heritage area on driving trails and in historic towns with 33 towns across Ireland having been provided with funding.In Golf, the signing of five-year contracts for the Solheim Cup and the Ladies Irish Open and the securing of a new sponsor for the Irish Open tournament which will take place in Co. Louth Golf Club in May ‘09.  .Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have intensive marketing and promotion activities planned for 2009 and some of these are already underway, which will position Ireland both to the home and overseas market as an exciting, active and fun holiday destination.7. Invest €335 million under the National Development Plan in marketing Irish Tourism. Progress to date:Tourism Ireland implements an extensive marketing programme each year for the island of Ireland in Great Britain, Mainland Europe, North America and in New and Developing Markets. In the context of Tourism Ireland's 2008-2010 corporate plan, the objective is to continue to seek to win market share from our competitors.The Tourism Services budget of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism for 2009 is €160 million, including €48.5 million specifically for overseas tourism marketing.Tourism Ireland completed a fundamental review of Tourism Brand Ireland in 2007 to ensure that the brand proposition will continue to resonate with visitors into the future having regard to the changes that have taken place in Ireland and the world marketplace in the interim. Following on from this work new advertising and promotional materials are being rolled out in 2009.Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland have worked closely in developing a regional marketing strategy to help support a wider spread of overseas visitors across the island. This strategy highlights ease of access and the variety of things to do and see, particularly in the regions.8. Seize the opportunities presented by the Open Skies arrangement with the US to substantially increase the number of US visitors. To this end, we will provide marketing support to the Shannon region for a transitional period to help consolidate existing markets and develop new sources of business.  Progress to date :An Economic & Tourism Development Plan for the Shannon Airport Catchment Area, developed by the Minister for Transport in cooperation with other relevant Ministers, was published in January 2008.A special overseas marketing programme, designed to address the challenges to the Shannon Airport catchment area post Open Skies, was launched in February 2008.  €3 million was provided for this purpose in 2008 and again in 2009. The marketing programme is the result of close collaboration between Tourism Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and a Tourism Working Group which has been specifically formed for this purpose. The campaign — ‘Discover Ireland's Wonderful West' — which is running in the U.S. and Great Britain highlights the many attractions of the western regions from Kerry to Donegal, including ease of direct access from many gateway cities, the good value fares and inclusive packages available, as well as showcasing a range of compelling offers from local industry. The campaign includes print, online, and radio advertising, co-operative marketing campaigns undertaken with airlines and tour operators and U.S. media and trade visits to the Shannon catchment area.The Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment Scheme was launched by An Taoiseach in June, 2008.  Since then, the Board, which will approve and certify projects submitted under the Scheme, has progressed its work, supported by Fáilte Ireland and Shannon Development, and the agencies have also organised several information seminars with tax practitioners and tourism operators to outline the operational details of the Scheme.Tourism Ireland continues to implement the recommendations contained in ‘North America; Land of Opportunity' which was published in November 2006 following a comprehensive review of the American market and seeks to attract a significant increase in visitor numbers to the island.9. Build on the opportunities presented by the increasing availability of low-cost flights from mainland Europe and the UK.  Progress to date:Tourism Ireland continues to work with airports and carriers in marketing campaigns to highlight the direct, competitive and convenient air access to Ireland. This activity is an important element in its regional strategy and particular emphasis has been placed on carriers and airports serving the regions of Ireland.In 2008, Tourism Ireland devised and implemented co-operative campaigns with a range of carriers including Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Aer Arann, Air France BMI Baby and the leading American Airlines serving the Island of Ireland. These will be continued in 2009. In addition, cooperative campaigns have been implemented with sea carriers such as Stena, Irish Ferries and P&O.10. Undertake a strategic review of new and developing markets to identify the investment and actions needed to realise their potential.  Progress to date:A review of new and developing markets, undertaken by Tourism Ireland, was launched at the end of 2007 with a view to securing growth in New and Developing Markets visitor numbers and revenue in the medium to long term.In order to position itself to secure increased business from new and developing markets, Tourism Ireland has established an office in Shanghai, China and has appointed representatives in Mumbai, India and Dubai. Tourism Ireland has also received North South Ministerial Council approval to set up a Hub Office in Abu Dhabi to manage the Asian markets.11. Put in place a strong promotional programme for the new National Conference Centre in Dublin with a view to doubling the level of business tourism to Ireland from €400 million to €800 million per year over the next ten years. Progress to date:The National Conference Centre (NCC) is well-advanced and on schedule and already a number of conferences have been secured for September, 2010 onwards.Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Dublin Convention Bureau are working closely with the operators, in marketing the Centre to secure bookings for 2010, when the Centre is scheduled to open, and beyond.  In October 2008 the Convention Centre Dublin management team confirmed to Fáilte Ireland that already there are 10 confirmed events and 60 conference options.  This represents a provisional booking amounting to over 70,000 delegates.In the overall context of business tourism, the Business Tourism Section of Fáilte Ireland, working with Tourism Ireland and industry partners through the Business Tourism Forum, is implementing co-ordinated marketing strategies to grow high yield conference and incentive business from key overseas source markets to Ireland.Fáilte Ireland provides distinct business supports for the Business Tourism Sector, aimed at developing and growing the business tourism visitor market.Fáilte Ireland targets ambassadors and conferences of between 100 and 6000 delegates through: promotion of the Convention Centre Dublin, as described above; conference support; and ambassador and conference research.In 2008 Fáilte Ireland supported 89 conferences through conference support.  These conferences brought revenue of €32 million into the Irish economy.The Association Conference Programme is operated by Fáilte Ireland as a support programme for potential conference ambassadors who may avail of professional help in organising their conference.In addition, Fáilte Ireland has created a dedicated business tourism brand.  This new brand underpins all Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland's marketing communications, thus ensuring Ireland's competitive advantage is clearly and succinctly communicated to our international audiences.Fáilte Ireland has a dedicated business tourism website which is managed by the Failte Ireland Business Tourism Unit.  In 2008, this website had 32,665 search engine click-throughs to irelandinspires.com (a 200% increase on 2007).  It should be noted that this website is targeting a business-to-business customer, and therefore does not have the mass appeal of a business to consumer website.Fáilte Ireland also supports the Incentive and Corporate Meeting segment. The Irish trade, i.e. hotels and destination management companies, receive support to attend international trade shows. These events are forums for the trade to meet with key potential buyers from international markets. In 2008, 45 Destination Management Companies received support for site inspections and familiarisation trips.12. Investigate the feasibility of a Regional Conference Centre in the Shannon/Limerick area.  Response :The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism asked Fáilte Ireland to arrange an objective and independent study of the feasibility of such a facility.  Indecon Consultants were engaged to carry out the feasibility study, the report of which was submitted to Fáilte Ireland, and this report has subsequently been presented to my Department.The report concludes that the case for a regional conference centre in the Shannon/Limerick area is subject to considerable uncertainty and is marginal at best.  Having examined the report, I agree with its findings and I intend to have this report published shortly.13. Encourage the Tourism Agencies to highlight our National Games to a greater degree in their promotional activities and continue the policy of attracting suitable major sporting events to Ireland.  Progress to date:The GAA from its most senior administrative level and throughout the regions and local areas are being encouraged to become more aware of the tourism potential of Gaelic Games and to work with the Tourism agencies on issues of information and access.Fáilte Ireland's International Sports Tourism Initiative (ISTI) is designed to attract major sporting events that can showcase Ireland as a major tourism destination.  The events targeted have the ability to generate significant international media coverage and bring economic benefit to all the regions of Ireland.A number of major sporting events are being supported in 2009, as follows:Rally Ireland, a round of the World Rally Championship is a cross-border event taking place at the end of January 2009. This event will be run through seven counties, Cavan, Leitrim, Fermanagh, Tyrone, Sligo, Donegal and Roscommon. State sector support for the event is being provided jointly between Fáilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL).Galway will be one of eleven host ports in the Volvo Ocean Yacht Race 2008/2009.  Fáilte Ireland is providing a comprehensive support package over two years as part of the arrangements to secure Galway's status as a host port. The race is expected to attract 140,000 visitors to Galway over the two weeks of the stopover, and generate a €43 million return on investment (direct and indirect).The Tour of Ireland will take place between 19 — 23 August 2009.  This is an annual event on the International Cycling Union calendar.  It gives an opportunity to showcase some of the most scenic tourism areas of Ireland to a worldwide audience and attracts a number of the world's top teams and cyclists.The Irish Open Golf Championship will be staged at Co. Louth Golf Club in May 2009.  A new sponsor has been secured for the event which will be one of the most prestigious events on the European Tour calendar for 2009 which guarantees extensive TV exposure.In addition, the Solheim Cup is to be hosted by Ireland at Killeen Castle, Co. Meath in 2011.  The Solheim Cup is a biennial transatlantic team matchplay competition which is considered the ladies golf equivalent of the Ryder Cup. Government sponsorship — through Fáilte Ireland — for the Solheim Cup 2011 amounts to €5 million over 5 years (including €2.5 million towards the Ladies Irish Open during this period).14. Seek, with the Tourism Agencies and Local Authorities, suitable areas to develop and promote eco tourism, as well as enhancing the existing Northwest Project, the Green Box.  Progress to date:Overall, ecotourism is an area of significant potential growth for the tourism sector over the coming years.  Accordingly, during 2009, Fáilte Ireland will undertake market research in Ireland's principal overseas markets to provide a clearer understanding of the potential size of the ecotourism market and the particular needs of this emerging market.Ecotourism is one of the themes for the new Tourism Learning Networks, which are being run on behalf of Fáilte Ireland in 2009.  Three of these (West region, North-West region and East & Midlands region) are being run for Fáilte Ireland by the Greenbox in partnership with First Western.During 2008, Fáilte Ireland funded the preparation and publication of an "Ecotourism Handbook" which is a practical guide to both existing tourism businesses and those who wish to start new businesses.  This handbook was published jointly by the Greenbox and Fáilte Ireland in January 2009.Fáilte Ireland is also committed to the promotion of the EU "Flower" eco-label for tourism accommodation that complies with specific eco-friendly criteria, which it launched on a pilot basis within the Greenbox area.  During 2008, Fáilte Ireland provided €14,400 to the Greenbox to undertake 24 baseline environmental audits of tourism businesses, which represented the first step in working towards EU Flower accreditation.At present, 23 tourism businesses in the piloted Greenbox area (18 in the Republic of Ireland and five in Northern Ireland) have received the EU Flower.In April 2008, Fáilte Ireland also funded an exchange workshop between the Greenbox and Burren Connect (a project in the Burren working towards improved visitor management in the Burren), with a view to introducing certified ecotourism to the Burren.  This workshop led to the establishment of the Burren Ecotourism Working Group, which meets regularly, hosted by Burren Connect, with a view to developing ecotourism within the Burren.In its 2008 report "A Review of Good Environmental Policy and Practice in the Tourism Industry", Fáilte Ireland set a target for Ireland to have 50 EU Flowers by the end of 2009.  This would represent the highest concentration of EU Flower eco-labels for tourist accommodation in any of the EU Member States.The Tourism Infrastructure Fund, from which local authorities and other public bodies were eligible for support within Fáilte Ireland's Product Development Programme, emphasises the provision of environmentally sustainable and enhancing infrastructure, so that an ecologically friendly offering is developed.15. Invest in new information and communication technologies for marketing and customer relations management and training. Progress to date:Fáilte Ireland's suite of websites was redesigned and re-launched in 2007, with enhancements introduced, including an advanced interactive mapping facility to speedily allow the consumer to access accommodation and attractions of interest. Investment in a new self-catering e-business platform to link into the discoverireland.ie website is planned for 2009.The Small Accommodation Sector support programme provides funding and support for the development of eBusiness capability and marketing through the provision of matched funding for investment in websites, booking systems and search engine marketing campaigns.  Significant supports were put in place in 2008 with all the representative bodies and associations.  Based on the success of the 2008 programme, investment will continue in 2009 for upgrading the ICT resources of each of the sector association groups.  Also, it is planned to put in place a task group to develop a bespoke e-business strategy for the bed and breakfast product to address changing consumer behaviour in the sector.An eBusiness programme for small and medium accommodation providers has been designed to help operators promote their business online and sell more rooms through this channel. The programme is offered at two levels — Introductory and Intermediate. Introductory Level is aimed at operators with little or no knowledge of the internet or email while Intermediate Level will encourage operators to use the tools of the internet to grow and develop their business. Over 50 programmes, catering for over 500 operators took place between May and December 2008.In 2008, Fáilte Ireland launched a new Web support initiative aimed at assisting tourism SMEs in the area of e-business and web development.  This initiative is part of a broader e-business strategy designed to support SMEs in developing their web capability.  In 2007 over 50% of tourists who came to Ireland used the internet to plan their holiday and this is projected to increase to 75% by 2010.The first phase of the Fáilte Ireland Web Support Initiative "WEB-CHECK" is well under way with a total of 476 SMEs participating in the programme. The businesses involved reflect the broad spectrum of the tourism industry with B&Bs, self catering, equestrian, activity, golf, hotels and attractions all actively engaged in the initiative.WEB-CHECK essentially involves an SME being partnered with an e-business specialist who works onsite for one full day with the individual business in identifying e-business/web needs while providing guidance towards the appropriate solutions. Participating businesses gain practical, one-to-one advice from an expert who helps the individual SME through the process in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  During 2009 an additional 380 WEB-CHECKS are scheduled to be delivered.WEB-BUILD, the second phase of the initiative which was launched in the last quarter of 2008 will allow for the implementation of the agreed improvement measures as identified in WEB-CHECK. Areas of focus within WEB-BUILD will involve delivering improvements to website functionality, on-line sales and e-marketing campaigns.   During the period October to December, 2008 40 WEB-BUILDS were undertaken. A further 160 WEB-BUILDS are scheduled to be delivered during 2009, incorporating approximately 40 WEB-STARTS (i.e. a facility specifically designed to assist tourism SME's to develop a web-specification for the design and construction of a website tailored to their individual business needs).The final phase, WEB-SKILLS, will provide additional training support through a series of regionally-run workshops to continue strengthening the SME's web presence.  During the period October to December 2008, 10 WEB-SKILLS e-business workshops were held with a total of 180 delegates attending. In 2009 an additional 30 WEB-SKILLS e-business workshops are scheduled with a target of 600 delegates to attend; in addition four inter-regional e-Symposiums are scheduled during 2009.16. Work with the Regional Tourism Development Boards, in conjunction with Local Authorities and the Tourism Industry, to develop comprehensive, interactive local area tourism websites.  These will carry details of all possibilities in an area for tourists and will have a booking facility. Progress to date:The Discover Ireland website  www.discoverireland.ie  is the main tourism website for the Irish domestic holiday market and is powered by the National Tourism database known as the Tourism Contents System or TCS which is a comprehensive database of all activities, attractions, accommodation, events and businesses in the tourism industry.The www.discoverireland.ie website is currently being re-designed, to ensure it is fully accessible, more efficient and user friendly.  This project is expected to be completed in May 2009.  Workshops will be conducted with the trade and consumers to ensure their requirements are met in the new design.  There will no longer be a booking facility as part of discoverireland.ie.  Instead, each premises will use its own booking engine/preferred booking partner to conduct business.  Part of the redesign, however, will include developing a platform for special offers from the trade to meet the challenging economic environment they are now facing.Hosted within discoveireland.ie, each region has its own website, thereby achieving significant economies of scale for hardware and software e.g. www.discoverireland.ie/west or www.discoverireland.ie/southwest. Within these sites, the Tourism Contents System provides all the data relevant to tourism in that area. The TCS is updated on a daily basis within each region e.g. with details of upcoming festivals and events.As a subset of the regional sites, a number of sub-regional sites have been created to focus on particular areas of tourism interest e.g. www.discoverireland.ie/connemara or www.discoverieland.ie/lakelands. As a subset of the regional site, each county is also represented under discoverireland.ie. For example, www.discoverireland.ie/cork or www.discoveireland.ie/offaly. This presents the data from the Tourism Contents System relevant to that county.A comprehensive programme of activity of upgrading and optimising the information in the TCS and the websites is ongoing and is an essential focus for Fáilte Ireland.All of the websites provide the consumer with the opportunity to book accommodation online. All registered and approved accommodation is available to book.17. Invest €149 million under the National Development Plan, 2007-2013, in training and human resources in the tourism sector.Implement in full the Fáilte Ireland ‘Competing through People' programme, which looks to people working in the Industry as a principal source of competitive advantage, and their skills as a key variable in delivering strong business results. Progress to date :The National Development Plan, 2007-2013, includes a Training and Human Resources sub-programme of €149 million.Participation in Fáilte Ireland skills development, education, and tourism advocacy programmes increased by more than 20% to over 16,000 in 2008.  This activity was aimed at potential and new labour market entrants in addition to the existing tourism workforce.  The objective of these programmes is to develop practical skills and build capability in key areas of customer service and enterprise management. A similar number are expected to participate in this activity in 2009.Fáilte Ireland continues to play a role in mediating between the skills needs of the tourism industry (classified by Forfás as a medium skills industry, drawing significantly on specialist operational craft skills) and the teaching practice and provision of the Institutes of Technology.  Without these core craft skills, tourism enterprises will fail to meet the standards demanded by consumers and the competitiveness and sustainability of the industry will correspondingly suffer.  A deliberate shift in policy direction has been introduced in this area — moving from a fulltime towards a part time model of training.  This shift in emphasis has been introduced to secure greater efficiencies in training delivery through the Institutes of Technology (IoTs).  Negotiations with the IoT sector are ongoing with a view to full implementation of programme change in 2010.Fáilte Ireland is broadening the range of skills development opportunities available to both existing tourism staff as well as those developing entry-level skills in preparation for joining the industry. This involves a continuing emphasis on training design and innovative delivery methods, as well as a strong focus on practical work experience. Having successfully identified and addressed an industry desire to improve the guest service experience at operative level in 2008, training resources in Fáilte Ireland training centres will continue to offer a short, focused, onsite improvement programme for front-line staff in 2009.  Fáilte Ireland will target 3,000 customer facing operatives in industry for the first half of 2009, again at a time convenient to the enterprise and on-site thereby minimising time lost and operational disruption.The new online Tour Guide Programme at foundation level — developed and successfully delivered late in 2008 — will be offered again in 2009.  In the meantime, the National Tour Guide programme at FETAC level 6 has been made available on-line since January 2009.  Both initiatives are designed to train multi-lingual tour guides to work in the coach tourism sector.

I am pleased to say that action is being taken in a progressive manner in these areas to ensure these targets are met in the lifetime of the Government.Roll out the Local Sports Partnership programme on a nationwide basis to promote the development of sport at community level. [47776/08]The Local Sports Partnerships network is now fully established in 33 different areas throughout the country. These will now act as a conduit to allow for the delivery of programmes and training to local communities.Prioritise Sports Capital Programme Grants towards those areas identified as most in need of funding/facilities. [47779/08]Change the application criteria of the Sports Capital Programme grants to require only 10% of own funding / contribution where applicants are located in a recognised area of urban disadvantage such as RAPID and a Local Drugs Task Force area. [47785/08]Promote greater sharing of school and community sports facilities and make it a condition of the Sports Capital Programme that facilities be made available to schools where appropriate. [47795/08]Encourage more schools to apply for funding under the Sports Capital Programme by collaborating with their local sports clubs, and/or community groups. [47796/08]Through the Sports Capital Programme, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The 2008 Programme was advertised in January and allocations were made at the end of July 2008 the details of which are available on the Department's website dast.gov.ie.For the 2008 Sports Capital Programme the Department introduced a number of changes to implement key commitments contained in the Agreed Programme for Government.  The level of own funding required from applicants in urban disadvantaged areas has been reduced from 20% to 10%.  This covers applicants from RAPID and Local Drugs Task Force areas.  This change is in keeping with the Government's commitment to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas.  When completed, the National Sports Facility Strategy and the National Sports Facility Audit which is currently underway will further help to direct the provision of facilities to areas most in need of funding and facilities.The Programme for Government also contains important commitments to promote greater sharing of sports facilities between schools and local sports clubs.  Under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme, schools making joint applications with local sports clubs are required to provide evidence of formal agreements with local clubs that guarantees the clubs access to school facilities for at least 30 hours per week throughout the year.  In assessing applications, extra marks are also awarded to sports clubs that can show that they are allowing local schools to use their facilities.  I intend to discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, how his programme for the provision of sports halls in schools and the Sports Capital Programme might be dovetailed to provide greater value for money and enhanced facilities both for schools and the local community users.The inter-agency steering group, established to oversee the development of a National Sports Facilities Strategy, includes representation from the Department of Education & Science.  The work of this group has included discussions with the Department of Education & Science on how its policy on the provision of sports hall facilities and my Department's policy for the provision of sports facilities might be complementary.Fund Special Olympics clubs. [47780/08]In 2008 Special Olympics Ireland received €2,849,188 from the Irish Sports Council to support the organisation.Continue to support the Irish Sports Council as the statutory agency for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport. [47782/08]The Irish Sports Council, which was established on a statutory basis in 1999, has witnessed a major increase in the levels of funding from the Department from €13.5m in 2000 to over €53m in 2009.Promote a national advertising campaign highlighting the health benefits of sport and exercise. [47784/08]This is being considered by the Irish Sports Council as part of the development of a Participation Strategy. Discussions have also taken place with the HSE in relation to possible co-operation in this area.Produce a Green Paper on Animal Welfare in Sport and Recreation. [47791/08]The most effective process for giving effect to this commitment will be considered in consultation with the relevant stakeholders.Ensure that Local Sports Partnerships have an official dedicated to the promotion of girls and women's involvement in sport. [47798/08]Appoint a member of the Irish Sports Council to deal with all aspects of women in sport, including the gender proofing of all Sports Council decisions. [47799/08]Establish a Forum on Female Participation in Sport in conjunction with the Irish Sports Council to make recommendations on all issues. [47800/08]Create an Annual Women's Sports Award Scheme. [47801/08]The Women in Sport Programme has received significant Government funding since it was launched in 2005.  Through the Women in Sport programme, the Government supports the work of the Irish Sports Council in encouraging women — young and old alike — to become involved in sport as participants, players, officials and administrators.All LSP staff are fully aware of the need to involve more women and girls in sport and dedicated funding has been made available to operate innovative projects at LSP level to encourage more females into becoming active. In light of the level of funding made available to LSPs it would not be possible to appoint Women in Sport officers in all 33 sites. However, LSPs do work closely with the Women in Sport officers that have been appointed by NGBs such as Special Olympics, Badminton, FAI and IRFU.An officer of the ISC is assigned to looking after all aspects of the Women in Sport Programme. This is not the sole responsibility of this person but all areas of the WIS Programme are under their remit.Representatives of the ISC have attended international conferences on Women in Sport where examples of best practice were discussed.  From this year the ISC will co-sponsor the Irish Times Sportswoman of the Year awards.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	976	I propose to take Questions Nos. 800, 801, 808 to 810, inclusive, 811, 812 and 821 together.Complete, in conjunction with the local sports partnerships, a national audit of local sports facilities. [47777/08]Put in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of necessary local facilities here, followed by a yearly monitoring of improvements delivered. [47778/08]Ensure accessibility as a key component in the provision of sports and recreational facilities. [47786/08]The nationwide audit of sports facilities is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase one, which focuses on national and regional sports facilities, has now been completed within my Department.  Phase two of the audit, which is a more complex undertaking to establish a record of existing sports facilities at local level and identifying the need for future provision, commenced in 2008 with the assistance of Local Authorities.The audit is part of a wider exercise to put in place a more strategic approach to the provision of sports facilities in Ireland.  Work on the National Sports Facilities Strategy is at an advanced stage in my Department.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment/grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the facilities requirement for sport so that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport at either amateur or elite level.The issue of strengthening the requirements of accessibility in the provision of sports and recreational facilities will be addressed in the context of the National Sports Facilities Strategy and in future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department. —  Further develop the Sports Campus Ireland development at Abbotstown, incorporating the Irish Institute of Sport, and including the development of a new 25,000 seater stadium to accommodate athletics and field sports. [47787/08]During 2008, work was advanced on providing a headquarters for the Irish Institute of Sport. This involves refurbishing an existing building on the Abbotstown site. Construction has now commenced and the Irish Institute of Sport is expected to move into its new HQ during 2009.  Following the appointment by the NSCDA last year of Project Management and Design Teams, detailed plans for Phase One of the Campus have been brought to an advanced stage of preparedness and with a view to an application for Planning Permission being made at an early juncture.The facilities planned for the first phase of the project include:A National Field Sports Training Centre catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey;A multi-sport National Indoor Training Centre which will provide world class training facilities for over 20 sports;Sports science and medical facilities;Accommodation for sports men and women; andAll-weather synthetic pitches for community recreational access.The facilities being provided in Phase 1 do not include a 25,000-seater stadium. Any proposal to include such a facility will be considered in the context of later phases of the Campus project.  The progression of the project is contingent on economic conditions and the prevailing public finances. Accordingly I am reviewing with the NSCDA how best to advance the campus project.Provide a national stadium at Lansdowne Road in order that the national rugby and soccer teams have a first rate facility in which to play their games. [47788/08]The development of the new stadium at Lansdowne Road is continuing to proceed satisfactorily. As of end 2008, €185 million of the Government grant of €191 million has been invested in the project. I am pleased to say that the project is on schedule for completion during 2010. I continue to be most impressed by the rate of progress being made on the construction and am looking forward to the opening of what will be an excellent sports facility during 2010.Support elite athletes in preparation for the 2008 and 2012 Olympics and develop proposals for Ireland to be used as a base for other national teams in advance of the London games in 2012. [47789/08]The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, has statutory responsibility for encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport.  In this regard the ISC works in partnership with the Irish Institute of Sport, the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Paralympic Council of Ireland and the relevant national governing bodies of sport in the preparation of Irish athletes for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.The ISC established a review group to examine the preparations and performances at the 2008 Beijing Games in order to prepare for the 2012 London Games.  The overall aim of the review is to make recommendations to the ISC in respect of structures, programmes and investment policy which should be pursued based on the outcomes of the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games.   I understand that the review will be completed shortly.I have met with a number of the key stakeholders involved in the support of our elite athletes to discuss how we can best build on the success we had in Beijing and the supports required in terms of coaching, programmes, facilities and funding to ensure the optimum performance of Irish athletes at the London 2012.  It is my intention that the issues arising from these meetings will dovetail with the review being carried out by the ISC.The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Task Force was established in August 2006 to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from our proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London 2012.  The Task Force included experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and was supported by staff within my Department.The Task Force report makes a number of recommendations arising from an audit carried out of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.  The report highlights the opportunities for Ireland from the London 2012 Games in the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors.  On the sporting side the report puts forward proposals for investment in sports facilities which would increase our attractiveness as a training destination for Olympic teams in the lead up and during the games. I understand that enquiries have already been made about the availability of sports facilities here for some Olympic teams.I am considering the implementation of the recommendations of the London 2012 Task Force Report taking account of the current economic situation.  I will be publishing the report shortly.Continue with the implementation of effective and modern anti-doping programmes here, which have earned recognition internationally. [47790/08]Ireland's national anti-doping programme is administered by the ISC.  The annual funding provided by my Department to the ISC includes funding to enable the ISC to meet its statutory function to combat doping in sport.  In supporting sport the Government insists that it must be based on fair and ethical principles. The ISC has put in place a comprehensive and effective Anti-Doping Programme, one that the Government strongly endorses and which is recognised internationally as an outstanding model of its type.  Ireland also contributes to the international efforts against drugs in sport through our support for the Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping, the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, WADA — the World Anti-Doping Agency and the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport.Recognise the importance of volunteerism in the promotion of sport through the expansion of the volunteer awards scheme for persons in sport here.  [47802/08]The first programme of National Awards to Volunteers in Sport was successfully held in 2007. The Awards recognises and encourages the work of volunteers and reaches out to potential new volunteers.  Any further phases of the Awards programme will be subject to available resources.

Relevant schemes include the Rural Development Programme, the Rural Development Fund, the CLÁR programme, the Rural Social Scheme, the Enterprise Scheme for non-Gaeltacht offshore islands, and Rural Recreation Schemes.Of the foregoing I might particularly mention the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (Axes 3&4).  The overall aim of these aspects of the Programme is to improve the quality of life in rural areas and promote the diversification of the rural economy. Support for Business Creation and Development is the primary measure supporting enterprise development artisan and speciality food production. The Deputy will be aware that I announced the Local Action Groups selected to deliver the Programme on the 4th of November 2008 along with their individual funding allocations.  The signing of contracts is currently underway and I expect the Programme to be open to applications for grant assistance in the very near future.In addition, a number of initiatives designed to promote and encourage artisan food production have been supported by my Department. Funding of €81,000 was provided from the Rural Development Fund for the appointment of a Small Food Producers Coordinator to work with LEADER groups, statutory bodies, representative organisation networks and others in developing and supporting the small food producers sector during 2008.  The artisan food study tours ‘Terra Madre' took place in September, with the help of funding from my Department.  500 participants visited leading food producers in five Counties in the South East of Ireland.  Many of these food producers have received LEADER funding from my Department.In addition to the schemes and programmes operated directly by my Department, the Deputy will also be aware that responsibility for the creation of employment in Gaeltacht areas rests with Údarás na Gaeltachta, a body that comes within the ambit of my Department. The work of this body includes the development of rural enterprises. Information in relation to assistance provided by Údarás na Gaeltachta is published in that organisation's Annual Report and Accounts which, under sections 18 and 19 of the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act 1979, are laid annually before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Information is also available on its website at www.udaras.ie.Finally, the Western Development Commission, another body that comes within the ambit of my Department, has responsibility for fostering and promoting economic and social development, including rural enterprise and job creation in the Western Region.

The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the Programme for Government, which is operational until 2012, has a further three years to run and the matter will remain under review.In overall terms, I am satisfied that significant investment in rural development will continue within the ambit of my Department. This will include the provision of significant funding in 2009 in relation to CLÁR, the development of Rural Recreation and the Rural Social Scheme. In addition, the LEADER elements of the new Rural Development Programme will invest €425m in rural areas and the rural economy over the lifetime of the Programme. This should leverage some €600m in other investment, leading to a €1 billion package of investment for rural development over the coming years. Significant measures under the Programme will also help rural tourism. Conservation and upgrade of the rural heritage, as well as village renewal and development.

However, while CIÉ holds a number of unused railway lines, only a few have been abandoned and have become free therefore for other development.One such line is the Tralee-Limerick line. A portion of this line — the Great Southern Trail (GST) — continues to be developed as a recreational amenity. My Department has provided funding of €62,500 to date in progressing the GST project. This includes €20,000 towards the inspection and repair of an important viaduct on the trail.  In addition, I organised a meeting in September 2008 of interested parties in the GST project, which included CIÉ, Limerick County Council, Shannon Development, Fáilte Ireland and members of the local GST Committee. Limerick County Council subsequently announced in November 2008 that they were proceeding with a project costing €552,638 on upgrading the trail, which will mean a significant tourism boost for the region.

The RRO will act as a contact person for walking tourists and will provide a wide range of support and advice.I made over €0.5m in capital funding available to Fáilte Ireland in 2008 to assist in the development of the national network of looped walks to a total of 79 trailheads and 119 Loops to date.  Provision of €0.63m capital funding for Fáilte Ireland is planned for 2009, which will see at least one looped walk in each of the 26 counties.I have allocated €90,000 (€30,000 per annum from 2006-2008) to Wicklow Uplands Council and Wicklow Rural Partnership to provide a network of access routes over private lands in areas of high scenic and amenity value in County Wicklow.I have also allocated €60,000 to the Irish Uplands Forum, over the period of their Statement of Strategy 2008-2012, towards the development of a positive network in pursuit of a partnership approach to sustainable uplands management.In addition, my Department is actively pursuing with CIÉ the possibility of using former railway infrastructure as recreational trails for activities such as walking and cycling.Separately, discussions are continuing with Coillte to discuss the possibility of expanding the use of their land for recreational purposes. I will continue to progress this matter, as I believe that it has considerable potential to make a significant contribution to rural recreation.  A service level agreement was put in place in 2008 to provide for:Maintenance of trails, forest parks, picnic areas and other recreation infrastructure;Maintenance of a national team function;Signage and infrastructure improvement;Improving recreation information and website; andDeveloping new recreation initiatives.

However, my Department is cognisant of concerns that should land be used on a permissive basis for recreational purposes, this would not mitigate against the landowner successfully applying for planning permission on such land.  My Department communicated these concerns to the City and County Managers Association (CCMA), which is a member of Comhairle na Tuaithe.  The CCMA subsequently contacted all local authorities with the recommendation that the existence of permissive walkways on a landholder's land should not affect consideration of planning permission applications.

As agreed by the Working Group, the HSE have appointed a Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator and the National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, chaired by the Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator, has been established.  The first meeting of this Committee was held towards the end of 2008 and the second meeting is being held this week.  The recommendation in regard to extra detox beds and drug-specific community employment places will be pursued through the Committee.Overall progress in implementing the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation will continue to be monitored through the Inter-departmental Group on Drugs which I chair. I can assure the Deputy that I will be pursuing its implementation as set out in the Programme for Government.

Further funding was allocated in 2008 to develop and strengthen the work of the Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs), with over 440 LDTF projects currently receiving funding.Funding continued in 2008 under the Premises Initiative Fund, which addresses the accommodation needs of community drugs projects in Drugs Task Force areas.  In addition under the new Regional Youth Initiative, capital funding has been provided for the development of 16 dedicated youth facilities in RDTF areas not covered under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the YPFSF has transferred to the Office of the Minister for Children & Youth Affairs since 1st January 2009.

Since 1997, more than €65m has been provided by my Department and its predecessor for the development of island infrastructure.  In 2008, a further €33m was paid for this purpose, bringing the total amount provided from 1997 to date to almost €100m.  This unprecedented level of investment has resulted in significant improvements to access infrastructure on and for the islands. The following examples illustrate this:the construction or development of piers at a number of locations, including Árainn Mhór and Machaire Rabhartaigh in Co Donegal, Coney Island in Co Sligo, the Clew Bay islands of Clynish, Inishlyre, Insegort and Islandmore, as well as Inis Bigil, Doran's Point, Clare Island, Inishturk and Roonagh in Co Mayo, and the Co Cork islands of Whiddy, Bere, Sherkin, Cléire, Long and Heir;the construction of airstrips at Clifden and Inishbofin and the resurfacing of airstrips on the Aran Islands;the provision of new helipads on Árainn Mhór and Cléire;coastal protection and pier improvement works on Inishbofin, andmajor pier and harbour developments on the three Aran Islands: including the construction of a new pier on Inis Meáin which was completed recently, while the largest development ever undertaken by my Department (in excess of €40 million) is progressing at Cill Rónáin, Árainn, and plans for the development of the pier on Inis Oírr are ongoing.As island access infrastructure has improved, so too have associated access services.  At this stage, my Department is funding 21 island transport services, including ferry and air, compared to just 7 in 1997 and, of course, many of these older services have been greatly improved since then.  The annual cost of these subsidised services is approximately €5m.The cost of transport for passengers and cargo to the islands has been a major issue for island communities.  The capping of passenger fares for islanders on contracted ferries (€8 for adults; €5 for students and children) has made a significant difference, as has the reduction of tariffs on cargo services.

Regarding the Rural Development Programme launched in May 2008, €45.4 million is being made available under the Encouragement of Tourism Activities measure, which includes both language based, and countryside recreation based tourism. The objective of this measure is to promote the sustainable tourism potential of all rural areas through the provision of the necessary infrastructure and the development of the countryside as a recreational resource for all. In addition to specific tourism investment, certain other funding to be provided under the Rural Development Programme will also support rural communities and enterprises in tourism-related projects particularly, funding under the Diversification into non-agricultural activities measure, which includes a focus on agri-tourism.As the Deputy is aware I announced the Local Action Groups selected to deliver the Programme on the 4th November 2008 along with their individual funding allocations. The signing of contracts is currently underway and I expect the Programme to be open to applications for grant assistance in the very near future.In relation to Údarás na Gaeltachta, strong working partnerships exist between Údarás and Fáilte Ireland, particularly through their regional offices and other tourism organisations, to optimise the opportunities provided by the tourism industry for the Gaeltacht. In 2007, employment figures in the Gaeltacht-based tourism sector (language, cultural & service based activities) increased by 25% over the 2006 level. Údarás na Gaeltachta provides ongoing assistance to island co-operatives in the Gaeltacht to assist their development and to promote the development of cultural tourism in the Gaeltacht. The Department has co-funded a three-year marketing campaign for island tourism with Fáilte Ireland at a cost of €343,000.

My Department has made considerable progress in relation to the development of community services on our islands through the Rural Social Scheme (RSS). The RSS programme on the islands, which is implemented by the new integrated local development company for the islands ‘Comhar na nOileán Teoranta’, has a quota of twenty participant places. Eleven projects were undertaken under the scheme in 2007. The number of projects undertaken in 2008 increased to 20.  While the islands benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fisher persons, participants also have the opportunity to improve existing, or develop new skills and perform valuable work to the benefit of Island communities.Under the Community Services Programme (CSP) support has been approved for eight community enterprises located on seven islands in counties Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Cork and Mayo; the islands are Arain Mhór, Inis Oirr, Inis Mór, Inishbofin, Valencia, Bere and Achill. The CSP support is in the form of a contribution to employment of a total of five managers and 28 full-time equivalent workers (some comprising part time workers) as well as an allocation for non-wage expenses. The services provided through the community enterprises include support for tourism initiatives, services in the form of transportation, recycling, literacy, translation, social care, services for older persons, youth support and maintenance of community halls and facilities.The operation of the Community Employment and Job Initiative Schemes on islands is a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

Based on the views and recommendations expressed by the public during this process, a discussion document was published that drew together the various strands and outlined the key elements to be addressed in the Strategy.  A further series of public meetings was then undertaken that gave people the opportunity express their views as to this document.In addition to the public consultation, Fiontar DCU consulted with key stakeholders in both the public and voluntary sectors as to their recommendations for inclusion in the Strategy.  Fiontar were also assisted by a number of international experts in language policy issues.  A draft Strategy has now been submitted for my consideration.  I anticipate that my proposals in relation to the 20-year Strategy will be submitted to Government in the near future.

Funding of some €1m per annum has been provided by my Department via the Higher Education Authority for high-level skills initiatives to meet the requirements arising from the official and working language status of Irish in the EU and the implementation of the Official Languages Act. These requirements particularly relate to translation services, but also to increasing the supply of other professionals needed to serve the Irish language community.In addition, 86 language schemes have been agreed to date under the Official Languages Act with public bodies to improve their provision of public services through Irish.My Department is continuing to work with Foras na Gaeilge and other interested parties in relation to putting in place key resources to enhance the capacity of the public service to provide services through Irish.  With regard to the development of a Quality Assurance System for Translators, Foras na Gaeilge has, at my request, developed an accreditation system for Irish language translators.  125 translators have now achieved the required standard.  The system is a significant resource for public bodies in their implementation of the Official Languages Act.  The accreditation system will be a continuous process and will involve examination of translators at regular intervals on an ongoing basis. In that regard, I understand that it is intended to hold a further examination before May 2009.  Full details of the panel of accredited translators is available on the website of Foras na Gaeilge, www.gaeilge.ie.In addition, I understand from Foras na Gaeilge that they will continue to provide training/upskilling opportunities for translators, including an online course for translators, accredited by NUI Maynooth, and a series of intensive workshops, which will be held in venues throughout the island between March and November 2009.With regard to the development of an Accreditation System for Editors, Foras na Gaeilge will introduce such a system before end-2009.  In order to ensure the highest standards, Foras will instigate a series of training opportunities during 2009 for accredited translators who wish to achieve accreditation as editors/revisers. A new course for editors, funded by Foras na Gaeilge, has been written and will be published as a textbook for the translation sector in August 2009.

However, Údarás na Gaeltachta and my Department have also provided assistance for child care facilities in the Gaeltacht in the form of capital funding and provision of suitable sites.In addition, an tÚdarás may provide feasibility study grants to help community groups in Gaeltacht areas with design and other related preliminary costs associated with the building of such facilities.  Discussions are ongoing with the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in relation to the provision of Irish language crèche services in the Gaeltacht.

In 2007 and 2008, marketing initiatives were put in place with a focus on marketing the Gaeltacht as a place in which to learn Irish and hear the language spoken and as a tourism destination of outstanding merit.  These initiatives have been rolled out over the past year with an emphasis on e-marketing as well as traditional multi-media publicity campaigns.

In total over €45m has been approved to date for water and sewerage schemes since the programme was launched in 2001.  Currently, there is in excess of €17m in outstanding commitments under these measures.In relation to accepting new applications for Water and Sewerage schemes, I am currently reviewing the CLÁR programme as a whole, having regard to demand, the funding available and the level of outstanding commitments.  In this context, I will consider the reintroduction of modified Water and Sewerage measures when circumstances allow.

While I received a request from this group for funding under the Community Services programme (CSP), I have already indicated to them that I am not in a position to consider an application.  The last call for applications under the Programme was made in 2008 with a closing date of the end of June last.  An application was not received from this group in that process.  To date, I have announced funding for some 60 successful applicants from the 2008 call and I hope to be in a position to announce further funding in the coming months as proposals are assessed and the level of resources available to the Programme in 2009 become clearer.The CSP supports a range of community business and social enterprises to deliver a diverse range of local services and employment opportunities.  It has a particular focus on the engagement of people who are disadvantaged and in supporting communities that suffer a range of disadvantage or lack of services.  Groups supported by the Programme are required to provide good quality employment opportunities and pay the going rate for the work undertaken.  Each supported group is required to have the ability to earn the required balance of funding to ensure its operations and its future sustainability through charging for services, fee or trading income.  Therefore, a key requirement of the Programme is the degree to which the applicant can demonstrate its ability to earn the balance of the funding required so that its employees are offered good quality jobs at the going rate of pay.

Among the issues discussed was the implementation of the Rural Development Programme. My Department manages the implementation of Axes 3 and 4 of this Programme, which is focussed on quality of life in rural areas and diversification of the rural economy and is implemented by Local Action Groups using the LEADER approach.The Deputy will be aware that I announced the Local Action Groups selected to deliver the Programme on the 4th November last along with their individual funding allocations. The Kildare Local Action Group, Cill Dara ar Aghaidh Teo, received an allocation of €12,282,448 under the Programme. The signing of contracts is currently underway and the Programme will be open to applications for grant assistance in the very near future.  The Kildare Local Action Group is the decision-making authority in relation to approving projects falling within its business plan.

This is evidenced by the fact that the funding targeted at community-based initiatives funded through my Department's Vote doubled from 2003 to 2008 — from €31.5m over €64m.The relative reduction in the 2009 funding allocation to my Department for the drugs initiatives must, therefore, be viewed in that context.  In 2008, the budget for community-based initiatives in the Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas was nearly €34.8m.Funding for 2009 will be approximately €34.6m, which, in overall terms, is a minor reduction.  Of this amount, over €23m is being allocated to the Local Drugs Task Forces while over €11m is being earmarked for the Regional Task Forces.  These have already been approved funding for projects for the first six months of 2009 and the National Drugs Strategy Team will be reviewing this expenditure before allocating the remaining six months funding.All Drugs Task Forces have been asked to identify savings across their area of responsibility.  While I appreciate that there may be some difficult choices to be made, it will be a matter for the Drugs Task Forces to identify measures to enable them to work within their allocated budgets.As the Deputy is aware, the Drugs Strategy is based on a co-ordinated effort across many Government Departments and Agencies and my Department's allocation is only part of a much bigger investment programme in drugs services by these other bodies.  In 2007, it was estimated that expenditure on drugs programmes across all the bodies was in the region of €230m.  The figures for 2008 are currently being compiled.

The initiative involves a number of local and regional campaigns that will be run through the mechanism of the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces. The campaigns are being designed to encourage people to provide any information they may have on drug dealing — anonymously if required — through a confidential telephone line. This information will then be forwarded to An Garda Síochána for appropriate follow-up action.Under Phase 1, five local campaigns were launched in October and November 2008:Dublin North East LDTFTallaght LDTFBlanchardstown LDTFSouth West RDTFNorth Inner City LDTFPhase 2 of the campaign is scheduled to begin in early 2009 in the following areas:Southern RDTFCork LDTFSouth East RDTFMid-West RDTFNorth Dublin City and County RDTFIt is hoped that the final phase will cover the East Coast and Midlands RDTFs and Bray, Dun Laoghaire and Finglas/Cabra LDTFs.The National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST) consulted all the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces in 2007, and again in April 2008, to assess their interest in rolling out a local campaign. Neither the Canal Communities LDTF nor the Dublin 12 LDTF, which cover parts of the South Central area, opted to run a campaign.  However, the confidential number used in the campaign is open for all to use regardless of the area they come from.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1035	Support for farmers on low incomes is available through the farm assist scheme.  While this means-tested payment is broadly similar to the jobseeker's allowance scheme, it has a more generous means test, which takes account of the specific nature of farming and, unlike jobseeker's allowance, farmers claiming this payment do not need to be available for work outside of the farm in order to qualify.The general increases in social welfare rates provided in recent years mean that it is now easier for low income farmers to qualify for support under the scheme.  For instance, the personal rate of payment has been increased by €6.50 from €197.80 to €204.30 a week from the beginning of January, while the increase for a qualified adult has been increased by €4.30 from €131.30 to €135.60 a week.  Increases for qualified children have also been increased from €24 to €26 a week.  This means, for example, that a low income farming family with 3 children can now receive a maximum weekly payment of €417.90, i.e. an increase of €16.80 a week (4.2%), which is ahead of the projected average increase in the Consumer Price Index of 2.5% for 2009.In addition, improvements in the method of assessing earnings from insurable employment, which were introduced in September 2007, provide further gains for families claiming farm assist, where either spouse is also in insurable employment.The farm assist scheme is kept under review in the light of relevant developments, e.g. changes in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS), Rural Social Scheme etc.  In this regard, officials from the Department of Social and Family Affairs recently met with the IFA to discuss a number of concerns, including short-term income problems created by the high cost of fodder due to bad weather; assessment of farm income in the context of single farm payments; the treatment of off-farm income; and the situation of farmers who have had off-farm employment but are now unemployed.  While it was considered that the current operation of the farm assist scheme remains sufficiently flexible to meet these concerns, it was also acknowledged some farmers who are now experiencing financial difficulties may not be sufficiently aware of their possible entitlements under the scheme.  The Department has therefore, agreed to participate with the IFA in local information seminars.In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, the farm assist scheme continues to be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that it is meeting its objectives.

On foot of a High Court judgement, delivered on 19 October 2007, the judge made a declaration, pursuant to Section 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, that Sections 25, 63 and 64 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 are incompatible with the obligations of the State under the European Convention on Human Rights by reason of their failure to respect the private life of the Applicant, as required by Article 8 of the Convention, in that there are no provisions which would enable the acquired gender identity of the Applicant to be legally recognised in this jurisdiction.This is the first time that the High Court has made a declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of a provision of Irish law. As such, the High Court judgement is very significant and raises complex and far-reaching issues, not merely for this case but for future cases under the European Convention on Human Rights Act. The judgment has implications for a wide range of legislative and policy areas including taxation, social welfare, pensions, family law, criminal law, equality, employment, sport, financial services, health, education and so on.As the judgment is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, it is not considered appropriate for me to comment in detail at this time, other than to say that I am keeping the matter under review.

However, current indications are that there was an excess of expenditure over income of the order of €200 million.  At the beginning of 2008, there was an accumulated surplus of over €3.6 billion in the Fund.  The estimates relating to the Social Insurance Fund which were published in the Budget 2009 documentation predict an excess of expenditure over income to the Fund in 2009 of the order of €902 million.   This will erode the accumulated surplus by an equivalent amount.  The data relating to the accumulated surplus will be updated to take account of the 2008 end-year position in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2009.It should be noted that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which was published in October 2007 predicted that the Fund would run an annual deficit from 2009 with the result that the accumulated surplus would be exhausted by 2016.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1042	I propose to take Questions Nos. 926 to 929, inclusive, and 951 together.The pension rights of scheme members are protected through trust law and by provision in the Pensions Act 1990 as amended. As supplementary pension schemes are usually established under irrevocable trust, the assets of the scheme are legally separate from the assets of the employer and are not available to any other creditors where the employer becomes insolvent.   Under trust law, trustees of occupational pension schemes have the principal responsibility for ensuring that the entitlements of the members are adequately protected and that they receive the pensions due to them.In addition to the safeguards provided by trust law, the Pensions Act 1990 also provides for the regulation of pensions schemes in Ireland. Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years. The Pensions Board can allow a scheme up to ten years to meet the standard in certain circumstances.Should a scheme be wound up by its trustees, the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended) specifies how scheme assets are prioritised.  In short, schemes first prioritise benefits that have accrued to members by way of additional voluntary contribution or transfer of rights from another scheme.  Benefits being paid to retired members come next in the priority list, followed by benefits to current and deferred members of the scheme.  The ruling in the Robins case concerned the transposition of Article 8 of Directive 80/987/EEC which provides for the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  I should point out that, in its review of the transposition of that Directive, the Commission gave an assurance that Ireland had adequately transposed the provision in that Directive.The Government is currently considering a number of options in relation to the ongoing security of occupational pensions.  Any decisions made in this context will be considered as part of the development of a long term framework for pensions. Our overall objective is to deliver a pensions system which will provide an adequate income in retirement for everyone, while at the same time being affordable in the immediate and long-term future — a key consideration in the current economic environment.

Payment of a supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent/mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.  When last set in 2004, the minimum contribution represented approximately 10% of the minimum social welfare weekly payment rate. While social welfare payments have risen by nearly €70 per week since then, no upward adjustment was made to the minimum contribution.As part of Budget 2009, the minimum contribution has been increased from €13 to €18 a week from January 2009. This contribution represents 8.8% of the basic social welfare weekly payment.  While the new rate of €18 will reduce the differential between the contribution which rent and mortgage interest supplement recipients pay and the contribution payable under the local authority differential rent scheme, it is still significantly less than the minimum rent paid by many local authority tenants i.e. €24.87 in Dublin city and €26 in Limerick county.

Local Offices are staffed by civil servants, whereas Branch Offices operate under a contract for service to the Department.  Branch Managers are obliged under their contract to provide sufficient clerical assistance to allow for the efficient performance of the work of the office.As of the 1st January 2008, the Branch Manager in Maynooth had 3 full time and 1 part-time clerical staff in his employment.  During 2008 an additional 2 full time staff were recruited to cater for the increased claim load in the Branch Office.  The Branch Manager concerned has indicated to the Department that he is reviewing his staffing requirements for 2009.  All claims taken in Branch Offices are decided in the parent Local Office, which in the case of Maynooth Branch Office is Ballyfermot Local Office.  During 2008, 2 additional staff were assigned to the Local Office to deal with the increasing Live Register.

These conditions vary from scheme to scheme.  In some cases there is an unavoidable time lag involved in making the necessary enquiries to enable decisions to be made.  Time can also elapse where the applicants do not supply all the necessary information in support of their claim. Increases in the number of claims can also impact on processing times. Operational procedures, the organisation of work, and the allocation of staff resources continue to be reviewed and restructured to maximise the processing capability in the scheme areas to improve these times.The following tabular statement sets out for comparison purposes the average times taken to award claims on a scheme by scheme basis, the information previously supplied for October 2007 and the corresponding details in respect of October 2008.SchemeOctober 2007October 2008Claims RegisteredClaims ClearedAvg.

The scheme was intended to provide income replacement for insured persons during short spells of incapacity or illness, while other payments are available to people who are unable to work long-term because of a disability or a medical condition.Prior to the recent introduction of changes provided for in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008, there was no limit on the amount of time for which Illness Benefit could be paid to people who had more than 260 social insurance contributions. A recently published OECD review entitled "Sickness, Disability and Work: breaking the Barriers" noted that paying illness or sickness benefit without a time limitation was very unusual across the OECD, and pointed to the risk that people in such circumstances will never return to the labour market.Against that background, recent legislation provides that entitlement to Illness Benefit will be limited to two years (or 624 days) duration for claims arising after the 5th January, 2009.  The person concerned has been in receipt of Illness Benefit since April 2008.  As the new arrangements apply only to claims arising after the 5th January, 2009, his current claim will not be affected in any way.

To qualify a person must satisfy certain conditions set out in legislation, including, that the person is unemployed, is capable of work, is available for work and is genuinely seeking work. The Department also offers a range of education and employment supports designed to assist and facilitate these and other people on social welfare payments on a long term basis to return to the active labour force.  The back to education allowance (BTEA) is the main education support scheme.BTEA is designed to encourage eligible people to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to work.  To qualify for the back to education allowance an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.  People who are not in receipt of a welfare payment or who have been unemployed for a short time are not the main focus of the scheme.In general, an applicant must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study and must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 6 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  However, lone parents and persons in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.In addition, the 12 month qualifying period has been reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process, where a FÁS Employment Services Officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individual's employment prospects.The operation of the Department's employment support measures, in the context of labour market conditions, is continually monitored to ensure it continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions.The Executive had advised that rent supplement in excess of the maximum limits applicable to the circumstances of this particular case, was paid as an exceptional measure on 22 December 2008 for a three month period from October 2008 to December 2008. The person concerned has been advised that the current rate of rent supplement will be paid to the end of March 2009 in order to allow her further time to secure accommodation within the prescribed rent limits.  It is open to the person concerned to contact the community welfare officer at the local health centre to discuss her entitlement to rent supplement.

Under social welfare regulations a claim may only be backdated where the claimant can prove that there was good cause for the delay in making the claim. The Deciding Officer considered that he had not shown good cause to have his claim backdated and payment was duly awarded from the date of claim.  He appealed the decision not to backdate payment to the Social Welfare Appeals Officer and his appeal was initially allowed on 21 July 2008.A further review of the Appeals Officer's decision was sought from the Chief Appeals Officer who revised the decision of the Appeals Officer and disallowed the appeal stating that the claimant did not show good cause for the backdating of his claim.

The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.No application for a fuel allowance has been received from the persons concerned.  An application form has now been forwarded to the family for completion. An electricity allowance under the household benefits package is in payment to people concerned.  In addition, if a recipient of a social welfare or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment has exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income, it is open to him/her to apply for a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.

My Department provides the secretariat to the working group which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as FÁS and the Health Service Executive.

Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. These levels surpass the "Towards 2016" commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  In June 2006, the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full time care for the purposes of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.Budget 2007 provided for new arrangements whereby people can receive a maximum payment equivalent to a half rate carers allowance while receiving another social welfare payment, other than jobseekers benefit or allowance.  In Budget 2009, I increased the rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week.  These increases took effect from January 2009. Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.Since 2005 the number of people in receipt of a carer's allowance has increased from almost 25,000 to approximately 42,500 and more than 2,200 people are now in receipt of carers benefit.  In addition to those in receipt of carer's allowance and benefit, more than 6,300 other carers have received a respite care grant in respect of 2008.  No decisions have been made to cut carer's allowance or any of the 50 or so schemes administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

The means test involves an assessment of the person's savings and investments, any property s/he may own, apart from the family home and any other income such as a pension from a former employer or from another country.Generally, self-employed persons are assessed with their income in the past 12 months to determine their expected income in the following year.  With the general downturn in the construction industry at the moment it is accepted that less work is available in that sector and that earnings in the previous 12 months may not be representative of expected earnings in the coming year.  The social welfare inspector will take account of this fact in projecting future earnings.The specific sections, subsections and regulations which set down the rules for the means testing of self-employed people for the purposes of jobseeker's allowance are listed.Parts I and II of the Third Schedule of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005;Rules 1(2), 1(2)(ix)(I) and (II), 1(2)(x), 1(2)(xi), 1(2)(xii), 1(8), 1(9)(a) and (b) of Part II of the Third Schedule of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005;Chapter 6 of Part 3 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) Regulations, 2007 (SI 142 of 2007) as amended.

Following the introduction of a new method of assessment of benefit derived from parental income, his means were revised from €58.00 to nil with effect from 27 April 2008 and his weekly rate of payment increased to €197.80.  His personal weekly rate of jobseeker's allowance is now €204.30.  However, since he commenced casual employment on 10 November 2008, he is assessed with means of €24.00 per day, in respect of each day worked.The letters issued to him on 8 January 2009 were notices regarding his means assessments and informing him that arrears of €2,724.90 in respect of the period from 27 April 2008 to 6 January 200 9, issued to him on 9 January 2009.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1075	I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that during 2007 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks.  However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks.  Oral hearings are granted at the discretion of the Appeals Officer usually in circumstances where there is a conflict in the evidence presented by both parties or where an oral hearing is requested by the appellant in order to present his or her case.  Given the logistics involved in organising oral hearings, the average length of time is increased by about 8 weeks when an oral hearing is involved.  Processing times for 2008 are being compiled at present but are expected to be at least of the same order if not higher having regard to a 27% increase in appeals received for 2008.  At present there are 1,486 cases waiting for an oral hearing.The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases and further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required.  Circumstances may also arise, normally outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals.  For example, delays can occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings.  In some cases adjournments may be sought by the appellant or his/her representative.Having said that, however, I am concerned about processing times for appeals being further increased and, having regard to the current level of appeals awaiting determination, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed in January to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Furthermore, in the light of the current situation, I am advised that the Chief Appeals Officer is initiating a review of current processes with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals having regard to due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.  While improving processing times remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, it is necessary at all times to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.

The total expenses incurred by these officers in 2008 was €470.37.  No overtime costs were incurred by these officers who are on call on a seven day per week basis.  I have also appointed, on a contract basis for my term of office, a Personal Assistant, whose salary is €55,030 per annum and a Personal Secretary, whose salary is €40,907 per annum together with a 10% attraction allowance.  Overtime costs incurred by these officers in 2008 were €7,653.44 and €1,290.66 respectively.The officers in question are based in my Department's headquarters in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, Store Street, Dublin 1.  It is difficult to attribute specific accommodation costs to these officers, as they represent only a small percentage of the total staff in that location.  There has been no Minister of State formally assigned to my Department.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1082	The Government announcement in Budget 2009 about the rationalisation of a number of State bodies included proposals that the Combat Poverty Agency which is under the aegis of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is to be integrated with the Office for Social Inclusion within the Department.  The Government's decision was informed by the findings of a review of the Agency which was undertaken on foot of a Government Decision on the 6th of June 2007.The legislation to give effect to the Government Decision is contained in Part 5 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2008.  The legislative provisions will be brought into effect by way of a Commencement Order and it is envisaged that the integration arrangements will be completed by June 2009.  It is not my intention that Combat Poverty Agency will simply be absorbed into the Office for Social Inclusion in its existing form.Rather a new strengthened division will be created which will make the best use of the considerable experience and expertise of the staff of both existing bodies and will seek to provide a stronger voice for those affected by poverty and social inclusion issues.  The new division will provide a unified institutional structure to support government, officials and the wider community in addressing issues of poverty and social exclusion.  It will play a pivotal role in co-ordinating the ongoing development and implementation of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion in collaboration with the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion, government departments, local authorities and agencies.The new division will have an enhanced role in high quality research in support of the strategic process and its work will be informed by independent data sources such as the statistics on poverty reported by the CSO, and independent analysis by bodies such as the ESRI and NESC and on the international front by the EU and OECD.Consultation and collaboration with social partners, including the community and voluntary pillar and a wide range of NGOs who have a strong voice in public debate about poverty and related issues will be a key feature of the way in which the new Division will work.  I have asked the new Division to prioritise the development of procedures to ensure that the views of these and other stakeholders, including people experiencing poverty, continue to be available to Government in developing and monitoring social inclusion strategies.

Kildare was exceptionally busy on Monday 12 January 2009 and by lunchtime the public office was filled to its capacity with a significant number of people queuing outside the premises. The public area in the office had reached its capacity in terms of its ability to offer service to the public and local management formed the view that it was not safe to allow this build up to continue. It was decided therefore to close the office at 1 p.m.  Members of the public already inside the building remained on the premises and were dealt with during the afternoon. At the time of closing, people outside the building were informed of the situation and requested to return on the following day.This was a once-off decision made in response to the circumstances pertaining in Newbridge Social Welfare Local Office on the day in question with public safety in mind. It was not a planned closure nor are similar closures planned in Newbridge or elsewhere.

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.The Executive has advised that the person concerned had been in receipt of rent supplement of €893.70 per month. It was necessary to review her entitlement when the Executive became aware that the person concerned was in receipt of income from maintenance which had not been previously disclosed.  Following the review, it was decided that she is entitled to a reduced rate of rent supplement of €503.70 per month.  The person concerned has now advised that she is no longer in receipt of maintenance payments. The Executive has requested documentary evidence to this effect and has advised that her entitlement to rent supplement will be reviewed once such evidence has been provided.

These have been fully investigated by the Board and no breaches of the Pension Act were found.Responsibility for public sector pensions rests with the Minister for Finance and other employing departments, while the regulation of the sale of financial products rests with the Financial Regulator. That said, the Pensions Board intends to develop an information booklet dealing with the issue of AVCs for public servants and which will provide information for those choosing between AVCs and added years.  The Pensions Ombudsman is, under legislation, independent in the performance of his duties and I understand that he has issued determinations in relation to a number of these cases.

Under section 58(3), if the objection relates to a minor error or misdescription in the relevant notification under section 46 which would not constitute an impediment to the marriage, a registrar may make any necessary corrections and give the amended marriage registration form to one of the parties to the marriage. Section 46 provides for notification of intention to marry to a registrar not less than 3 months prior to the date of the intended marriage. Such objections are dealt with directly by the relevant registrar and are not referred to the Registrar General for investigation.Under Section 58(4) of the Act, if the registrar believes that the objection relates to more than a minor error or misdescription in the relevant notification and considers that there may be an impediment to the intended marriage which needs to be investigated, it must be referred to the Registrar General for consideration.Under Section 2(2) of the Act, there is an impediment to a marriage if:(a) The marriage would be void by virtue of the Marriage Act 1835 as amended by the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees of Relationship) Acts 1907 and 1921 (i.e. if the parties are closely related by blood or marriage)(b) One of the parties to the marriage is, or both are, already married(c) One or both of the parties to the intended marriage will be under the age of 18 years on the date of solemnisation of the intended marriage and an exemption from the application of Section 31(1)(a) of the Family Law Act 1995 in relation to the marriage was not granted under Section 33 of that Act(d) The marriage would be void by virtue of the Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811, or(e) Both parties are of the same sex.Since the commencement of the marriage provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 on the 5th November 2007, five objections have been referred to the Registrar General for investigation under Section 58(4) of the Act. To date, two of the objections have not been upheld and the couples in question were advised that the marriage may proceed. The remaining three objections are still under investigation.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1090	The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents," put forward proposals to tackle obstacles to employment for lone parents and other low income families. These included proposals for the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of childcare and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.Any proposed new payment cannot be introduced without co-ordinated supports and services being put in place by other Departments and Agencies.  The Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion is working on an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations.  Issues including access to childcare support, education, training and activation measures are being discussed with the relevant Departments and Agencies in tandem with the development of a new payment scheme.To further inform the process, the Department, with the co-operation of FÁS, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Science, tested the proposals in both an urban and rural setting: Coolock, Dublin and Kilkenny.  These studies were carried out to facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme.  The process involved both lone parents and qualified adults. It was carried out on a voluntary basis and the take-up was low.The experience has however highlighted how both lone parents and qualified adults are not a homogenous group, are of different ages, have experienced different routes into their current situation and have different needs.  Educational levels of those who participated were generally low, there was little or no engagement with FÁS, some participants intended to return to full or part-time work when their child was a few months old; others, however, had been out of the work force for a considerable period of time. Earnings from previous employment were generally low.  For almost all of those intending to return to work, affordable childcare is a critical issue.  Officials in the Department continue to work on developing the proposed new income support payment and the experience of this engagement process is feeding into the development of our approach to working with lone parents and qualified adults.

At the request of the person concerned her entitlement has been reviewed and a Deciding Officer has accepted that no maintenance payments were received by her since 28 September, 2006.  Accordingly, the Deciding Officer revised her means assessment from that date.  Her new weekly rate of payment is €285.80.  Arrears of €7,812.50 will issue to her shortly.

For those carers in receipt of either Carers Allowance or Carers Benefit, the Grant is paid automatically.  The total expenditure on the RCG in 2006 was nearly €50.5 million, in respect of 42,000 recipients; in 2007 the expenditure was some €73.4 million in respect of just over 37,000 recipients; and in 2008 the spend (estimated at this point) was just  under €102 million in respect of nearly 60,000 recipients.  The amount of the Grant was  €1,000 in 2005, increased to € 1,200 in 2006,  € 1,500 in 2007, and €1,700 in 2008.In Budget 2005, potential entitlement to the Grant was extended to carers who, though not in receipt of either of the above payments, nonetheless satisfy the conditions with regard to the need for and the provision of full time care and attention.  The figures quoted below relate to these grants, and are included in the overall figures above.  The cost of the stand-alone Respite Care Grant in the three-year period from 2006 to 2008 totalled € 44.6 m and some 31,000 clients benefited from the scheme during this time.

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance a ppropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently €18, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than €18 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to con tribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs.The Executive has advised that the person concerned has been refused rent supplement as the total household income is sufficient to meet his accommodation costs. The person concerned has recently appealed against this decision to the HSE Appeals Office. He will be contacted directly when a decision has been made on his appeal.

His claim is currently with a Social Welfare Inspector for investigation of his circumstances. On completion of enquiries, a decision will be made as soon as possible and he will be notified of the outcome.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.The community welfare service must satisfy itself that an applicant for rent supplement has a genuine accommodation need for which he or she cannot provide, that a bona fide tenancy arrangement exists between the applicant and the landlord and that the property being rented is suitable to his or her needs.   In determining whether the accommodation is suited to the person's accommodation needs, a community welfare officer must establish the household composition, the size of the accommodation unit and identify any special needs that the person may have.The Executive had advised that rent supplement was refused in this case as the accommodation in question was deemed to be not reasonably suited to the needs of the person concerned i.e. the accommodation was larger than her family circumstances required. The HSE Appeals Office has advised that it has no record of an appeal from the person concerned.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1104	In February 2006 as part of its reform of the Health Sector, the Government decided to transfer the General Registrar'  Register Office, certain disability related income support schemes and the administration of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme and associated resources from the HSE to the Department.The General Registrar's Officer  Register Office transferred to the Department on 1 January 2008. The transfer of the Domiciliary Care Allowance Scheme will take place during 2009 with new claims being accepted in the Department from a date in May/June April and all existing claims will transfer by the end of October. The transfer of the Blind Welfare Allowance will take place subsequent to the transfer of the Domiciliary Care Allowance Scheme.Following a review, the Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowance scheme is being discontinued and current recipients are being transferred to other appropriate social welfare schemes. The transfer of the Mobility Allowance will be examined when the other Disability payments have been transferred.The Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme is currently administered by the Community Welfare Service on behalf of the Department. Provision has been made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Acts 2007 and 2008 for the transfer of the administration of the scheme to the Department. These provisions are subject to a Commencement Order.  Community Welfare Officers and other Health Service Executive staff will transfer to the Department to administer the scheme. A considerable amount of preparatory work for the transfer been completed and I expect to announce a date for the transfer this year.The integration of the Community Welfare Service into the Department will lead to a more coordinated approach to customer needs and the removal of duplications of work effort by staff. It will be a significant step towards the modernisation of the social welfare system and I am anxious that the transfer takes place as soon as is possible. While there are a number of human resource issues to be resolved, I am confident that the concerns of all the staff involved can be dealt with.

The re-constituted Oireachtas All Party Consultation Group on commemorative issues met on 9 December 2008 and were apprised of developments on several current projects.  With a view to developing the commemorative programme, I will continue to inform the Group of progress on such projects and the consideration towards a framework for official initiatives and support in the coming years.I expect that the framework for the commemorative programme will be launched sufficiently in advance of the Centenary anniversaries to ensure that commemorative initiatives by interested parties may be informed of opportunities for support or association with the national programme.The potential for development at the GPO complex in Dublin is being examined by the Office of Public Works and an assessment of the possibilities will be available soon for a presentation to Government.   Other current projects include: a phased multi-annual programme of works is underway at Glasnevin cemetery, scheduled for completion in 2016; the preparation of the personal files and records in the Military Archives for public access; the restoration of the yacht Asgard by the National Museum of Ireland.

It is the intention of the Government that the records will be made available in good time for the 100th anniversary of the Rising in 2016.I am pleased to report on progress with the project.  Additional staff have been recruited for the Military Archives in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  Of these, 1 senior civilian archivist/project manager and 3 archivists have been assigned to the Military Pensions Archive project.  With assignment of a dedicated project manager and archivists the project is proceeding in a timely manner.  The preparation of the personal files and records in the Military Pensions Archives for public access is underway. In addition, a scoping exercise has been completed that will guide the approach to the work.

This position is a function of the number of serving pilots, the number in training, the number of retirements and other anticipated departures.  I can confirm that the same position pertains for 2009.  There is no requirement to recruit Air Corps Cadets this year.  As regards the career talks to students, the position is that the Defence Forces receive requests to give career talks at schools.  At these talks they make the students aware of the different careers available within the Defence Forces.However whilst there are specific career paths in the Defence Forces it does not necessarily follow that there will be an opening for any or all of the careers in any given year.  The upper age limit for applicants for the Air Corps Cadetship Competition is currently under 28 years of age on 1 October in the year of the competition.  Leaving Certificate students will not only be able to consider this as a career but will also be eligible to apply for a number of years for any future Cadetship Competitions.

Ireland signed the Convention, subject to ratification, in March 2007. The Convention came into force on 3 May 2008.  In line with the Government's decision to sign the Convention in March 2007, it is intended to ratify the Convention as quickly as possible consistent with the need to ensure that all the necessary requirements under the Convention are being met.My Department is represented on the inter-departmental committee set up, under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to monitor the early implementation by Departments of the legislative and administrative changes that are necessary to allow the State to ratify the Convention.  The National Disability Strategy comprehends many of the provisions of the UN Convention. The inter-departmental committee has developed its work programme to address (i) the elements of the Strategy that require alignment with the Convention and (ii) any matters that fall outside the Strategy.From a Defence point of view, the only potentially significant issue is in relation to Article 27 of the Convention. Article 27 recognises the right of persons with disabilities to work on an equal basis with others. Domestic legislation, however, provides specifically that the Defence Forces are allowed to operate selective employment policies in relation to the two specified grounds of age and disability. I intend to seek legal advice on whether Ireland will need a reservation entered, at the time of ratification, in relation the employment of persons with disabilities in the Defence Forces.

The Plan is intended to deal with the provision of community facilities such as playgrounds, community centres, local markets, recycling, sports and recreational facilities and to be implemented in a way which would maximise impact in local communities and complement existing relevant programmes.As a first step, and in keeping with the recommendation in the Task Force Report on Active Citizenship, an audit of community, sports and arts facilities at local level was commenced in the second half of 2008 by each county and city council, under the auspices of the relevant County/City Development Board and in line with guidelines issued by my Department. These guidelines were developed in consultation with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of the Taoiseach and local authorities. A Steering Group representative of these bodies, as well as the Department of Community, Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs, is overseeing the audits. Some of the audits have recently been completed with the remainder in the process of being finalised at present. Further consideration of the matter will be carried out in the context of the public services expenditure estimates.

The Guidelines aim to achieve a balance between a good planning framework for rural housing and the local housing needs of those who are part of, or have links to, local rural communities.  While respecting the need to consider each planning application individually and on its own merits, planning officials were asked to ensure that the provisions of the Guidelines are applied consistently and uniformly.The Guidelines are a material consideration both in relation to development plans and in the consideration of planning applications.  I have used my powers under Section 31 of the Act on two occasions, directing the planning authorities to amend their development plans where the Guidelines have not been implemented or adhered to in their making.  The detailed application of the Guidelines to particular planning cases is a matter for the planning authority concerned or An Bord Pleanála, on appeal.  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of sustainable rural planning policies to ensure appropriate consistency in their application across all counties.

Section 10(2)(m) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires a development plan to include objectives for the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, including the promotion of Irish as the community language, where there is a Gaeltacht area in the area of the development plan.Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans were issued by my Department in June 2007 to assist planning authorities in the preparation and implementation of development plans.  Appendix C to these Guidelines sets out, inter alia, further considerations for planning authorities in the preparation of development plans in Gaeltacht areas such as demographic, economic and cultural factors, as well as particular facilities appropriate to Gaeltacht areas and the administrative and management structures that might be required.  These guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Act, which requires planning authorities and An Bórd Pleanála to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.  The Guidelines are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  The provisions of the Act and the statutory guidelines provide a strong legal underpinning of Gaeltachta and the Irish language in planning law.I am also a member of the Cabinet Committee on Irish and the Gaeltacht which was established last year.  I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Committee's programme of work is advanced, including the implementation of any necessary actions in the area of planning, to protect our linguistic and cultural heritage.

Accordingly, they are held within a specified four-day period in June every five years subsequent to 1979.  The Council announced in June 2008 that the 2009 European Parliament elections will take place between 4 and 7 June 2009.Each member state must fix a polling date within this period and, although a formal decision has not been made in the matter, I expect that, as on previous occasions, polling at the European Parliament and local elections will take place on the same day in June 2009.  I will make a statement in relation to polling day as soon as possible.

As of 26 January, 2009, 4,873 persons have successfully completed training courses on BER certification of dwellings with training providers registered by HETAC or FETAC and listed on the Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) website.  Training participants require an appropriate construction related qualification of at least Level 6 Award (Advanced Certificate/Higher Certificate) or equivalent and must achieve a score of 70% of the available marks at an end of course examination in order to be fully certified and eligible to register with SEI as a BER Assessor.Some 1,501 of those who have successfully completed a training course have registered to date as BER Assessors for new dwellings and 1,082 of these have extended their registration to cover energy rating of second hand dwellings.  This extension is subject to a signed declaration from the BER Assessor that he/she is fully familiar with the methodology for assessing second hand dwellings, accepts the updated Code of Practice and undertakes to sit SEI's BER Registration Exam before 31 December, 2009.  This exam will be available in test centres nationwide.   Registration will be discontinued if assessors fail to pass the SEI exam; however, in these circumstances, assessments already made will not be rendered invalid.The examination scheme has been designed to facilitate the introduction of annual competency testing from 2010 onwards to ensure that all BER Assessors are keeping their skills up to date.  Once the exam is available, all applicants will be required to pass the SEI Registration Exam prior to registering as a BER Assessor.  From 2010, renewal of registrations for BER Assessors will be subject to successful completion of competency tests.  All BER assessment activity is closely monitored by SEI and a robust system of audit and quality assurance checks is in place.In relation to the cost of BER assessments, in the case of an existing house owned by a person over 70 years of age, the position is that the statutory requirement to obtain a Building Energy Rating (BER) Certificate and advisory report only arises when the house is offered for sale or rent.   No specific proposals to assist persons over the age of 70 with the cost of BER certificates are under consideration by my Department at present.The cost of a BER Certificate is relatively modest compared to the value a house may realise in the sale or rental markets and, once obtained, a BER Certificate remains valid for 10 years.  The cost of obtaining the BER Certificate is borne by the owner / landlord.   The owner / landlord and any agent acting on behalf of such a person is obliged to provide a copy of the BER Certificate and advisory report to any person expressing an interest in purchasing or taking a letting of the building.   Failure to provide a prospective tenant or buyer with the required documents is an offence and may, on prosecution by a Building Control Authority, result in a fine not exceeding €5,000.In line with other Member States, no official fee for BER assessment services has been set in order to encourage the development of a competitive cost environment.  There are currently just over 1,500 BER Assessors registered with SEI and this number is expected to grow further in the coming months.  The conditions for a healthy competitive market for this service are therefore in place.  As with all services, home owners are advised to shop around for the best deal available.This recent steady growth in the numbers of registered BER Assessors, together with the increase in the demand for BER Certificates apparent since 1 January, 2009, is already exerting downward pressure on the cost of BER assessments and will ensure the ongoing development of a competitive market place for BER assessments.

In the case of the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes, my Department recoups two thirds of the cost of individual grants paid, with the remaining one third being provided by the local authority.

The Agency recently notified local authorities of its decision to pass on, in full, the 0.75% decrease announced by the ECB in December.  The effective rate for local authority borrowers from 1 February 2009 will therefore be 3.5% — a cumulative rate decrease since October 2008 of 1.75%.  With regard to the most recent announcement of a further 0.5% cut by the ECB, the Agency, in responding to any movements in ECB rates, must give careful consideration, on each occasion, to the fluctuating relationship between its lending rates and the cost of funds, given that the correlation between ECB rates and interbank rates (i.e. the rates at which the Agency itself borrows) is atypical and volatile at present.While it is hoped that it will be possible to pass on the most recent rate reduction announced by the ECB, as with previous rate reductions, it will be necessary to monitor the impact of the cut on interbank rates before a decision can be made.  I anticipate that, in common with the situation following the previous cuts which are being passed on in full to local authority borrowers, the position in relation to possible movement in the HFA's lending rates should be clear within a number of weeks.

The development in question was certified by the Authority to be consistent with the North Lotts Planning Scheme.However, in October 2008, the High Court found, inter alia, that it was ultra vires for the Authority to grant a section 25 certificate in respect of a development which, as proposed in the relevant application, is inconsistent with the relevant planning scheme, even with a condition the purpose of which is to render the carrying out of the development in accordance with the condition consistent with the planning scheme.  The Court made other findings, including the need for limited public consultation with regard to individual section 25 applications.  There was no finding of inherent deficiency in the provisions of the 1997 Act. The Authority has since amended its procedures to fully respect the findings of the High Court in this case.I am not aware that the Court's judgment has any implications for the planning system generally.  I understand that Dublin City Council has granted permission for the retention of the development in question, and I am not aware of any claim against the Authority arising from this matter.  The Authority is self-financing and does not receive any Exchequer subvention.  Any liabilities incurred by the Authority in the course of its activities are expected to be met from the Authority's own resources.

Regarding the question of the recyclates markets, representatives from the waste industry met with my Department on 24 October 2008 to discuss industry concerns regarding the sudden drop in international demand for recycled materials.  Their principal issue of concern was the need rapidly to increase the storage capacity of existing permitted and licensed facilities.  Immediately following this meeting, my Department contacted each local authority, by way of circular letter, outlining the possible options to deal with licensing of additional storage and stressing the need for local authorities to give priority to any applications received.On 31 October 2008, I announced the establishment of an action group to examine the situation and provide an early report to me.  The Action Group comprises representatives of industry, local authorities, Enterprise Ireland, EPA, the executive team implementing the market development programme and my Department.  The issue is one which affects a number of EU member states.  Ireland has raised it at official level with the European Commission and I raised the issue at the December 2008 meeting of the Environment Council where Ireland received support from 12 other Member States.The current problem highlights the importance of developing new markets and uses for recyclates.  I am fully committed to achieving the highest possible levels of recycling and to the continuing development of a national network of waste recycling facilities.  Since 2002, over €100 million has been allocated by my Department to local authorities to assist in the capital costs of establishing and developing such facilities.My Department also provides an annual subvention to local authorities to assist in the operational costs associated with their recycling facilities.  In November 2008 I approved payment of €10 million in respect of costs incurred in the 12-month period to June 2008.  A further €2 million will be paid to local authorities in respect of waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, collected over the same period at local authority sites.  I am also providing an additional €2 million to address the increased costs to local authorities as a result of the current market situation.  I recently opened a Materials Recycling Facility in Ballymount which will allow for high quality material to be available as the market recovers.

Among the many reasons given were that it is better for the environment, there are no plastic bags visible in the streets and that re-usable bags are more convenient for holding shopping.The National Litter Pollution Monitoring System is used to measure the impact of the plastic bag levy on an ongoing basis.  This showed that plastic bags accounted for approximately 5% of litter arisings prior to the introduction of the levy.  By 2005 this had decreased to 0.22%.  In 2006 data from the National Litter Pollution Monitoring Body showed an increase in the proportion of litter arising from plastic bags to 0.52%.  As a result it was decided to increase the levy from 15 cent to 22 cent with effect from 1 July 2007.  The most recent data from the National Litter Pollution Monitoring Body has reported that plastic bags accounted for 0.29% of litter arising in 2007.My Department also studies the receipts from the plastic bag levy in order to monitor trends in the average per capita consumption of plastic bags.  This data indicates that average per-capita usage of plastic bags has dropped from an estimated 328 bags prior to the introduction of the levy to a level of 26 bags per head of population in 2007.  Copies of the Environment Fund's Annual Accounts up to and including 2006 are available in the Oireachtas library and detail the amount received in respect of the plastic bag levy for years prior to 2007.  The 2007 Annual Accounts will be lodged in the Oireachtas library in due course after they have been audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

Under this new arrangement the purchase transaction will be largely unchanged from the affordable purchaser's perspective.  However, instead of units being sold at a discounted price, with the value of the discount being subject to a reducing clawback, the State will take an equity stake in affordable units sold.  The purchaser will have the option of either buying out the remaining equity in steps or at the end of a fixed period.Initially, it is intended to apply the new arrangement to affordable housing delivered under Part V, the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and the Affordable Housing Initiative, once the details have been finalised and the necessary legislative provision has been introduced through the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  These new arrangements will introduce greater equity into the system, provide greater protection of the State's investment and achieve better value for money because funds can be recycled into assisting further households with affordable housing.Full information on the revised arrangements will be made available prior to their commencement.  In the interim, the existing arrangements for allocation and sale of affordable housing continue to apply.  Prospective applicants for affordable homes should apply in the normal way to the local authority or local authorities in the areas in which they are interested in purchasing.  The website www.affordablehome.ie also carries information on affordable housing, and many local authorities are using this facility to advertise affordable homes, including application forms, in addition to their own local advertising and ongoing contacts with applicants on their lists.

I understand the new ISO 9001-2008 standard was introduced in November 2008.  Local authorities may re-apply for certification under the new standard in due course as current certification expires.I place a high importance on maintaining high standards of delivery across the local government sector.  A range of initiatives aimed at improving service delivery are in place across local authorities, including customer service charters and action plans; a greater focus on the use of information technology and online services; the establishment of customer complaint and consultation procedures and the introduction of local government-wide service indicators.  Quality service in local authorities in general is a key objective of the local government modernisation programme and is central to Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change, the Green Paper on Local Government which I launched in April 2008.  The Green Paper presents a set of options for change which share a strong common theme of renewing local democratic leadership and improving customer service.  I will shortly finalise the White Paper on Local Government, which will contain a definitive set of proposals in this area for Government consideration and publication.

Such measures are a necessary precursor to cost effective mains replacement in order to maximise reductions in unaccounted for water and leakage.Mains replacement proposals were received by my Department from the Council in April 2008 relating to the Fethard water supply system.  These proposals are being examined in light of progress with Stages 1 and 2 of the water conservation programme in the county and a decision will be conveyed to the Council as soon as possible.

Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act, 1996 precludes the Minister from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in particular circumstances, by a local authority of a function conferred on it under the Act.  Accordingly it is not possible for me or my Department to vary the contractual arrangements entered into by Dublin City Council or to comment on its specific terms.  Neither I nor my Department have had sight of the contract.

Following the recent downturn in the market for recyclates, markets have begun to reopen for high quality material, but commingled material, as described in the question, is regarded as low grade and will not find a market.  It would therefore appear to be in the interest of the waste collector concerned to change his collection practices.

This includes expenditure incurred by me, by the Ministers of State attached to my Department and by officials from my Department and Met Éireann.  Details of expenditure incurred by the agencies, offices or bodies under the remit of the Department are a matter for the agencies themselves.  The Department's policy on both domestic and foreign travel is that only necessary travel should be undertaken, and this is subject to a system of specific approval, which is designed to ensure that best value for money is obtained.

It was introduced in the context of the comprehensive review of planning legislation that culminated in the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  The revised legislation also provided increased rights for third parties in the planning process.  Since the enactment of the 2000 Act planning authorities are statutorily obliged to acknowledge submissions on planning applications and to consider those submissions before making decisions on planning applications.  Persons who make submissions are also entitled to be notified of: any new information provided; the decision of the planning authority; and an appeal against the decision of the planning authority.The fee for making submissions or observations to An Bord Pleanála in respect of a planning appeal is €50.  Section 144 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that, subject to the approval of the Minister, the Board may determine fees in relation to, inter alia, the making of submissions or observations.  It shall review such fees at least every three years having regard to any change in the consumer price index, and may amend them accordingly without the necessity of the Minister’s approval.  The last review of An Bord Pleanála fees was carried out in mid 2007 and the €50 fee for making submissions or observations remained unchanged.  There are no proposals at this time for the amendment of these fees.

Housing authorities have been provided with provisional allocations for their main social housing supply and improvement works programmes for 2009.  However, these provisional allocations may be subject to further possible amendment, and the programmes involved for 2009 will be discussed at the next round of Housing Action Plan meetings which is due to start in early March. It is the intention to issue final allocations for 2009 in April, following completion of the Housing Action Plan meetings.  It is a matter for each housing authority to prioritise projects under their Housing Action Plan in order to meet housing need as identified in the Housing Needs Assessment 2008.

The Housing Finance Agency Act 1981 was subsequently amended in 2002 to enable the HFA to lend directly to approved voluntary housing bodies.The Working Group on Voluntary & Co-operative Housing, which is representative of the voluntary & co-operative housing sector, the local authorities and my Department, subsequently considered the mechanisms by which this could be progressed and agreed that a pilot project, involving one of the larger approved housing bodies and Dublin City Council, should be advanced.  However, a number of issues arose, including potential legal difficulties, and a decision has been made not to progress a pilot project at this time.Projects progressed by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, including the costs of land acquisition, continue to receive financial assistance through the Capital Assistance and Capital Loan and Subsidy Schemes.  In accordance with the commitments set out in the Government's housing policy statement, (Delivering Homes: Sustaining Communities), it was agreed to streamline the administrative and approval arrangements for new voluntary & co-operative housing projects.  New capital funding approval arrangements in this regard have been in place since July 2008.

They are representative of local development bodies, State agencies and the social partners operating locally.  A key function of the Boards is to bring about the more co-ordinated delivery of public services at local level via their member bodies.The CDBs are not executive bodies and do not have a specific budget of their own.  They are supported in the main by the relevant local authority.  In this context, since 2000, a contribution towards the costs of the Boards' operations has been made annually to each county/city council through the General Purpose Grant from the Local Government Fund (LGF).  The LGF is financed through a combination of the proceeds of motor tax and an Exchequer contribution.An inter-departmental committee which I chair is currently involved in implementing the recommendations as set out in an independent review of the CDBs.  These recommendations are designed to strengthen and develop the Boards in line with the commitment in the recent Government statement on Transforming Public Services arising from the OECD review of the Irish Public Service and the subsequent Report of the Task Force on the Public Service.  As part of this the CDBs are currently carrying out a review of their strategies for the economic, social and cultural development of their areas to ensure that they remain focused on key priorities over the next three years.

There is no legislative provision that would prevent householders from erecting a notice (subject to compliance, as appropriate, with planning regulations) to reject or otherwise limit the material they would accept.  There are no current plans to introduce further legislation in this area.

The assumption of significant new functions under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 necessitated a review of the Board's operations and significant restructuring leading to the establishment of a dedicated Strategic Infrastructure Division within the organisation.  In light of these additional functions and the demands arising from sustained record levels of appeals over recent years, sanction was given in 2007 for an additional 35.5 permanent staff, bring the total complement to 172.  Board membership has also been increased from 10 to 11, on a temporary basis.The Board is focused on dealing quickly with the current backlog of cases and restoring compliance with its statutory objective of determining appeals and referrals within a period of 18 weeks, and expects to make significant progress in this regard over 2009.  I am considering legislative change, in the context of the proposed Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, to facilitate greater overall efficiency in the determination of cases by the Board.  In common with Government Departments and all other State bodies, the Board is reviewing its operations in the context of the ongoing work of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.

The task force was chaired by my Department and comprised representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda Síochana and Dublin City Council.The task force met on a number of occasions, and its work was informed by detailed consideration of a range of issues based on agreed terms of reference. Given the relevance of a number of different statutory codes to this matter, it was not clear whether planning regulation alone could adequately support an appropriate and effective local control regime, and the interaction of these various codes needed to be carefully examined to ensure that the best possible approach is taken.The task force has now finalised its work. Its Report outlining appropriate measures to progress the issues raised will be submitted to Government shortly.  In advance of any new proposals, it is open to local authorities to use the powers currently available to them under the planning code, such as the development plan process, to ensure that new late night entertainment venues are not inappropriately located, for example in quiet residential areas.

The final provision and its more detailed breakdown will be available on publication of the Revised Estimates Volume by the Department of Finance.   Details of the relevant annual grant schemes funded through the built heritage capital programme in 2008 are set out in the following table:Grant SchemeDescription2008 Expenditure€mCivic Structures Conservation Grant SchemeThe scheme is administered directly by the Department. It provides grants for the restoration and conservation of buildings of significant architectural heritage merit and which are in civic ownership or occupation and generally open to the public.2.923Significant Places of Public Worship SchemeThe scheme is administered by the Heritage Council on behalf of the Department. It provides grant assistance for major conservation works at places of public worship which are of significant architectural merit.1.835Local Authorities Conservation Grants SchemeThe scheme is administered by the local authorities on behalf of the Department. It provides grant assistance for the conservation of protected buildings i.e. those buildings which are on the local authority’s list of Protected Structures.6.594In addition, €0.624m was provided in 2008, under the built heritage capital programme, for projects at a number of significant heritage properties held in trust or private ownership and a further €1.681m was provided for conservation works at Fota House, which has been acquired by the Irish Heritage Trust.Under Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners to the owner/occupier of an approved building (including surrounding garden) or an approved garden existing independently in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the approved building or garden.  An approved building is one in respect of which determinations have been made by me, as Minister, that it is a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and by the Revenue Commissioners that reasonable access to the building is afforded to the public or it is in use as tourist accommodation for at least 6 months in any calendar year.  In the event of a determination being made by me, it is communicated to the Revenue Commissioners who make the final decision on the eligibility or otherwise for tax relief.Section 1003A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a scheme of tax relief in respect of heritage properties donated to the Irish Heritage Trust; a total of €6 million is available this year. In addition, tax relief is limited to 80 % of the market value of a property. To qualify for relief, the heritage property must be determined by me to be:(a) an outstanding example of the type of building involved;(b) pre-eminent in its class;(c) intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, horticultural, national, architectural or aesthetic interest; and(d) suitable for acquisition by the Trust.Following such a determination, the final decision on granting relief is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.

The share of electricity from renewable energy in 2007, the latest year for which published data is available, was 9.4%, which more than doubles the contribution from renewable energy sources from just over 4% in 2003.In January 2008 I announced an additional category in REFIT to support the construction of projects in offshore wind technology, to contribute to the Government's target of 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020.  My Department is currently in discussion with all stakeholders, including representatives of proposed offshore wind-powered projects, to set rules around qualifying conditions and timelines appropriate to the sector for publication this year.Technologies harnessing ocean and tidal energy are largely in the research and developmental phase.  Last year I launched the Ocean Energy Initiative to ensure Ireland is fully positioned to optimise our wave and tidal resources.  The multi annual Ocean Energy Package includes the establishment of the Ocean Energy Development Unit based in Sustainable Energy Ireland; the creation of a state-of-the-art National Ocean Energy facility in University College Cork; the development of a grid-connected wave energy test site off the west coast; the establishment of an Ocean Energy Prototype Fund and the introduction of a new feed-in-tariff under the REFIT scheme for wave and tidal technologies of €220 per Megawatt Hour.  I am pleased to confirm that all components of the Package are under way and are being progressed as a priority, with the involvement of stakeholders, by the Ocean Energy Development Unit.

In this regard, my Department has undertaken to implement a National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The NBS is designed to deliver broadband to areas where the market has failed to provide services including inhabited offshore Island and rural areas.  It will bridge the digital divide, create greater equality in terms of social and economic inclusion and remove the disadvantage caused by a lack of broadband services.  It will also facilitate competition in the broadband market in the regions leading to greater choice, quality and value for money to the consumer.Following the conclusion of a competitive tendering process, my Department has entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  The NBS will deliver broadband to certain targeted areas in Ireland in which broadband services are not available.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that fall within the NBS and who seek a service.  In order to facilitate competition in the area, 3 will also be required to provide wholesale access to any other authorised operator who wishes to serve residences and businesses in the NBS area.  3 is currently planning the roll out of the NBS and the first services will be deployed this Spring.  Details of the areas to be covered by "3" under the NBS are available at www.three.ie/nbs.

These programmes are available to all qualifying participants regardless of geographical location.  In the case of the Greener Homes Scheme, I have increased the grant rate by 50% for islanders, with the aim of significantly incentivising the use of renewable energy in island homes.In addition to these support schemes the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and SEI have jointly commissioned a study on the potential development of a wind and ocean powered smart network for the supply of energy for electricity, heat and transport for island communities.  The study will focus on the Aran Islands off the Galway coast but will also assess the potential application of the technologies and systems to other offshore islands.

Energy efficiency measures to tackle deficiencies in households will also support employment in the construction sector.Experience of the pilot phase of the Home Energy Saving Scheme in 2008 has demonstrated that there is considerable demand for a support scheme for energy efficiency measures, not only among householders, but also among building energy rating assessors, product manufacturers, installers and other market actors.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) estimates that demand among householders across the country could well exceed 100,000 homes over the lifetime of the scheme.  Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 on their energy bills if they implement the full suite of measures being proposed under the national scheme.SEI is at present finalising the details for the national roll-out of the Home Energy Savings scheme and I intend to announce the details of the scheme shortly.  While the pilot phase of the Scheme last year did not specifically include Mayo, it will of course be included in the national scheme.

The enabling of exchanges for broadband purposes is a matter for the owners of the relevant exchanges.  The design of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) involved a number of complex elements including the development of (i) a technology neutral procurement process and (ii) a map of the State showing areas that are unserved and served by broadband.While an area may not be served by digital subscriber line (DSL) broadband (i.e. by a DSL enabled telephone exchange) it may be served by service providers using different platforms (e.g. wireless, mobile, satellite or fibre).  In the event that an area is not covered by a DSL, wireless or mobile broadband service provider, it will be included in the NBS.  3, a Hutchison Whampoa company, have been awarded the contract for the NBS.  Details of the areas to be covered by "3" under the NBS are available at www.three.ie/nbs.  The general areas of Templemartin, County Cork and Kilmeedy in County Limerick are covered by the NBS.  The Newcestown area in County Cork is currently served by at least one service provider and does not fall within the NBS coverage area.

Insulation materials generally are not designed for direct exposure to an inhabited space.  They are commonly left exposed in an attic space, as attics are generally designed as ventilated and unoccupied space.  Where they are used in a converted or occupied attic space, insulation materials should normally be sealed behind a suitable barrier such as plasterboard.I am advised by Sustainable Energy Ireland that there is no requirement for traditional attic insulation materials to achieve the Irish Agrément Board certification, as such certification is designed specifically for new building materials, products and processes that do not yet have an established track record of use and for which national standards have not yet been published.

The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken various initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  While the provision of broadband services, including the digital subscriber line (DSL) enabling of exchanges is a matter for the service providers, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.In order to address this issue the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) was initiated.  All residences and business premises within the NBS coverage area will be able to receive broadband services by end September 2010.  The impact of the NBS will mean that there will be no unserved areas for broadband and this will further improve the strong strides made recently in regard to broadband penetration.  The latest figures from ComReg indicate that there are now some 1.125 million subscribers.EU State Aid and competition rules prevent States from intervening in the areas already substantially served by broadband.  While recognising that some premises within substantially served areas may have difficulties for whatever reason (long lines, pair gains, no line of sight etc.) in receiving a broadband service, the NBS scheme cannot cater for such limited instances.  It is expected that, over time, competing service providers would be attracted to offer services in such areas, given that those areas are already commercially viable for the existing service provider(s).

Of the Government's total contribution to the NBS amounting to €79.8 million, approximately €62 million will have been paid to 3 in 18 months time in accordance with the roll out targets.Over the period 2004-2008 some €164.954m has been spent on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) investment.  This includes investment in grant aiding private sector investment, investment in the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme, the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS), the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Schools Broadband Programme.The National Development Plan for 2007 to 2013 envisages total investment over the period of €435 million for communications and broadband.  €48.183m has been allocated for expenditure on the ICT Programme during 2009.  The main projects for investment in 2009 include: the National Broadband Scheme (NBS); completion of Phase II of the MANs Programme; the procurement of a Management Services Entity for the Phase II MANs; an international connectivity project in partnership with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland (Project Kelvin); and a demonstration project to deliver 100mbps broadband connectivity to post primary schools.The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.  In that regard it is envisaged that the investment by the service providers, facilitated by initiatives such as those outlined above, will underpin Ireland's continued strong growth in OECD and EU broadband tables.  That growth is reflected in the facts that 59% of households (end Q3 2008) and 83% of SMEs (end Q1 2008) in Ireland have a broadband connection.

This decision is reflective of recent easing in international fossil fuel prices, which follows a period of exponential increases in global oil, gas and coal prices.  I also welcome the substantial rebate being provided by ESB to all electricity customers, irrespective of which supplier has helped to stabilise electricity prices for 2009.  I fully expect that the CER will continue to closely monitor global price trends over the coming months in the context of future decisions on tariffs.

I am confident that improved information can lead to better management of stocks in the Wexford rivers.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1207	I have been advised by the Marine Institute that the fish counter on the river Boyne is located downstream of Navan at Blackcastle weir.  This site was selected because it met with all of the criteria for installing fish counters.  The site is described as an ideal experimental site to carry out scientific investigations into fish passage, stock dynamics, marine survival and fish behaviour as it combines a number of counting technologies, infra red counters, resistivity counters, mark and recapture and coded wire tagging.  While the counter covers most of the river at most water levels, very high water will lead to fish being able to access the river over the uncounted weir section. In this regard a correction is currently used to estimate the number of fish passing over the weir, which is standard practice for all partial counters.There is a monitoring programme being developed currently by the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and the Marine Institute to assess, by means of electronic fish tagging, the number of fish being missed by the fish counter.  This would refine the correction factor already in use to estimate the true size of the population.  The Eastern Regional Fisheries Board is also to undertake a feasibility study on the replacement of the partial counter with a full counter on the Boyne.  Fish counters, however, represent only one of the methods by which stocking levels are assessed.  Reliance is also placed on expert analysis of catch data, surveys by fisheries officers and research officers of spawning beds, fish populations and habitats.

I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.The CER in 2006 approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  This is to ensure that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns. In this context, Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ) is carrying out a comprehensive assessment of towns not already connected to the national gas network.I am advised that the towns of Roscrea and Thurles are included in a total of 43 towns being examined as part of Phase 3 of this assessment which is scheduled for completion in April this year.  The assessment does not include Templemore.  BGÉ's final report will outline which towns or groups of towns would be economically viable for connection, within the revised connection policy criteria.  In the event that the appraisal indicates that Thurles is viable for connection, I am advised that it may be possible to assess Templemore in that context.  BGÉ has a dedicated email address, newtowns@bge.ie, for the purpose of dealing with queries related to the connection of new towns and routinely engages with local stakeholders to ensure that towns under consideration are assessed in a fully informed and comprehensive way.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Broadband services are available from competing service providers over multiple platforms, including DSL (telephone lines), cable, fixed wireless, and mobile.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1212	The position in law is that the regulation of Bord Gáis Éireann natural gas tariffs is the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions.  I have no function in relation to the  setting of these tariffs.On 1 December the CER announced, following completion of Phase 2 of the Commission's 2008 review of Bord Gáis Energy Supply (BGES) tariffs, that there would be no increase in the price of gas supplied by BGES to its residential and SME customers.  That decision, which I welcome, takes into account the decrease in international gas prices on the wholesale market during the last quarter.  It should be noted that the recent decrease in global fossil fuel prices follows a period of exponential increases in wholesale prices of oil and gas and coal including Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) with new record price peaks in 2008.As a result the international market spot price of a therm of gas was 57 pence on 1 January 2009 compared to 53 pence on 1 January 2008.  These high prices reflected a complex interaction of strong demand, tight capacities, geopolitical uncertainties and the influence of speculators on the markets.  The relative performance of the US dollar against the euro also had an impact on oil prices.  It is salutary to note that the gas supply dispute between Russia and Ukraine of recent weeks caused renewed upward price trends in wholesale gas prices.  Global economic uncertainty allied to geo political factors will continue to be reflected in volatile fossil fuel prices and in this most uncertain environment I fully expect that CER will continue to rigorously monitor wholesale price trends as part of their ongoing review of tariffs.

Firstly an application must be made for a foreshore licence for a defined area of the seabed in which to explore the viability and environmental sustainability of the development. The licensing stage does not require the developer to provide specific details of the proposed installation.  Where the site for which a licence has been granted proves suitable, an application may be made for a foreshore lease.  The lease process evaluates the project and its impacts, it provides a consent for the construction and establishes a return to the state for the use of the Foreshore. Since 1 January 2008, there have been 12 Windfarm, 10 Tidal and 17 Wavefarm foreshore licence applications for Offshore Electricity Generating Station received for the purpose of site investigation. These applications are currently under consideration within my Department.

This application is under consideration having regard to a number of factors including objections from other aquaculture interests in Lough Swilly.  The objectors include the second person mentioned by the Deputy, who has also applied for an aquaculture licence in respect of a portion of the area held by Lough Swilly Shellfish Growers CoOp Society Ltd.It is important to note that there are a number of other competing aquaculture and wild fisheries interests in this area of the Lough and also that the Lough has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive.  In view of the complexities involved I have decided to proceed with a general review of shellfish aquaculture in Lough Swilly, the specific details of which will be announced shortly.

This was an issue that was provided for in the agreement between the Department and the pigmeat processing sector at the request of the sector representatives.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1218	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1160 and 1163 together.The amount of €180 million represents a facility rather than a target amount. The facility made available by the Government for the purpose of the Product Recall Scheme will be available to primary and secondary processors that comply with the eligibility conditions of the scheme. The purpose of the scheme is to provide assistance in respect of eligible product subject to recall from the market and eligible product in storage. The amount to be made available to primary and secondary processors will depend on the amount of product under the scheme that is eligible and verified by my Department. Terms and conditions, including product eligibility and payment arrangements are set out in the scheme details as published on the Departments website. €36million approximately has already been paid to primary and secondary processors as an interim payment.As regards pig producers, I have established a framework for determining applications for and the mode of assessment and payment of ex-gratia compensation that may be paid as a result of the slaughter of pigs deemed to be unfit for the food chain due to having been exposed to or suspected of having been exposed to contaminated feed. The framework broadly provides for compensation to be paid at market value rates and in excess of 100,000 pigs have been slaughtered to-date at agreed rates. The balance are expected to be slaughtered in the next few weeks.

Certain assumptions were made on the extent to which product in free market circulation would be subject to recall and prove eligible under the Product Recall Scheme. The amount of €180 million is a facility to enable processors to claim assistance in respect of eligible product rather than a target amount.

While the facility agreed with pig processors does not cover workers directly, a primary objective of the agreement was to secure the return to full scale processing as quickly as possible thereby securing the jobs of workers in the processing sector and the livelihoods of pig producers. I am glad that this objective was achieved.

The facility will provide assistance to processors for eligible product recalled from the market and for eligible product in stock.  Though the funding does not cover workers directly, as a result of the agreement between my Department and the processing sector, employment in processing facilities was secured, as was the earliest possible date for a return to work.

On the Irish market a series of promotional campaigns are planned. These will commence in February and will focus on building awareness and loyalty to the Bord Bia Quality Mark. These will underline the quality of Irish pigmeat and will communicate its origin.A customer reassurance programme will be carried out in export markets. This will entail continued direct Bord Bia contact with customers, placing key information about the Irish pigmeat industry in context and demonstrating the integrity of Irish health controls, a trade communications programme designed to position the capability of the Irish pigmeat sector and the safety and quality measures in place to influence key decision makers in the retail, foodservice and manufacturing sectors and a programme to maximise international market access for Irish pigmeat products. This will involve communications activities designed to build confidence among national authorities and opinion formers in markets based around Ireland's health controls.As regards beef Bord Bia's activities will continue to focus on building loyalty among key international customers and promoting Ireland as source of high quality beef and beef products.  My Department will work closely with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs to eliminate any remaining market access issues as a result of the dioxin issue.

The risk assessment for the Programme for  2009 will take cognisance of the experience of the dioxin contamination, and accordingly, the risk associated with drying of feed and grain will be reassessed as appropriate.  The risk reassessment will give rise to an increase in the level of inspections and sampling of feed materials for PCBs and dioxins at the establishments involved in the drying of grain and feed, including food recycling plants.  The inspection regime at food recycling plants will be similar to that carried out at approved premises producing compound feed.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1227	The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is included in Annex IV of Council Regulation (EC) 708/2007 concerning use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture.   Article 2(5) of the Regulation specifically exempts those species listed in Annex IV from the provisions of the Regulation, with the exceptions of articles 3 and 4.  Article 4 requires Member States to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects to biodiversity, and especially to species, habitats and ecosystem functions which may be expected to arise, inter alia, from the spreading of these species into the wild.The justification of exempting the Pacific Oyster from the provision of the Regulations is that it has been in production for many years and has been moved from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.A Member State shall request that a risk assessment is undertaken of an Annex IV species if they wish to take measures to restrict the use of the species in question in their jurisdiction.To assist in determining the future potential risk of widespread proliferation of the Pacific Oyster in Ireland the Marine Institute is funding a research study to document the level of reproductive effort of oysters grown on the seabed compared with the more traditional culture methods for this species.  This study is expected to be completed by September 2010.  The results of this study will be used to inform any actions that may be required consistent with the provisions of the Regulation.

The various measures under the AgriVision 2015 Action Plan, the Agriculture Chapter of Towards 2016 and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 are directed towards ensuring that full or part- time farmers have the necessary supports they need.Annual expenditure of almost €2 billion on direct payments, -including the Single Payment Scheme, Disadvantaged Areas payments and REPS- is made by my Department  to help achieve the objective of protecting farmers' incomes and of maintaining the optimal number of family farms.  In 2007, these net payments amounted to 71% of operating surplus in agriculture while the comparable figure in 2008 was 82%.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1232	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1187 and 1239 to 1241, inclusive, together.In line with the Programme for Government, my Department is actively engaged both nationally and with the Commission and like-minded Member States to pursue the simplification agenda on an ongoing basis and, in particular, to bring about a rationalisation of the cross-compliance arrangements and to streamline the financial and regulatory issues facing farmers.The introduction of the Single Payment Scheme in 2005 dramatically reduced the paperwork for farmers in applying for the scheme.  It also did away with the complex rules associated with the previous coupled schemes relating to retention periods, stocking densities and the like.  To further reduce paperwork for farmers, my Department introduced an on-line application system for the Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas schemes for 2007 to facilitate the application process.My Department also carried out a full review of the inspection arrangements and checklists for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements.  The cross-compliance regime is a critical element in delivering payments in excess of €1.7bn annually in Ireland.  The number of inspections is around 7,000 annually, down from 18,000 before decoupling was introduced in 2005.  This is a major simplification achievement.Following an EU Commission review in 2007 on the operation of cross compliance, I was successful in securing a number of legislative changes to simplify the system.  These included the introduction of a one-day availability rule for land and clarification of the cross-compliance responsibilities on this issue. In addition standard rules were introduced for the non-imposition of sanctions for minor breaches of requirements and for the waiving of sanctions under €100.The CAP Health Check provided further achievements on simplification of the administration of Schemes and of cross-compliance.There was agreement that the €100 threshold below which a cross compliance penalty need not be imposed would apply separately to the Single Payment Scheme and Rural Development measures.The requirement to deduct modulation from the full payment due to the farmer and then subsequently refund that element relating to the first €5,000 was abolished.  This helps both the farmer and my Department.  It means that the farmer will not have to wait up to 9 months for the refund and my Department will not have the administrative burden associated with first making the deduction and then doing the refund.We were also successful in doing away with the requirement for compulsory set-aside and with the complex management rules associated with it.  The farmer will be able to draw down full payment without putting land into set-aside.  Farmers will also be able to avoid penalties associated with the set-aside rules.In addition, the restriction on the transfer of National Reserve entitlements will be removed.  Under the old regime, entitlements from the National Reserve had to be used each year for 5 years before they could be transferred. They can now be transferred with or without land in the same way as standard entitlements.Usage rules have also been simplified.  The requirement that a farmer must have used 80% of his standard entitlements in one calendar year before he could transfer entitlements without lands has been abolished.  Moreover, the "use it or lose it rules" have also been streamlined. From 2010, standard and National Reserve entitlements will have a two-year usage rule.Finally, the CAP Health Check delivered an unambiguous commitment from the Council and the Commission to continue the simplification process.  The Czech Presidency has undertaken to continue the simplification process as a priority.

The Scheme was, however, closed for new applications on 31 October 2007 as applications had reached the level of funding provided for the Scheme in the Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016. Overall expenditure under the Farm Improvement Scheme in 2007 and 2008, was in excess of €12.9 million.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1237	Following the approval by EU Commission in September 2007 of the detailed Rural Development Programme (RDP), the implementation of the new schemes and increased payment provisions commenced.  In recent months, the budgetary situation has resulted in the curtailment of some of these measures.The total agriculture related RDP expenditure in 2007 was €634 million while to end December 2008 a further €653 million was spent. This expenditure of €1.3 billion is of the order of 22% of the overall total allocation for the seven-year programme and represents a considerable investment by the Government.  The 2009 allocation is €647 million.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1238	A range of measures, which are designed to assist farmers to maximise their income, are included in AV2015, Towards 2016, the NDP and the RDP. As already indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question 47653/08 my Department ensures that almost €2 billion in direct payments issue annually to assist farmers maximise their income from farming.A number of taxation measures are in place to encourage greater levels of land mobility and early farm transfer. Of particular note are the provisions in Budget 2009 which renewed stamp duty relief for young trained farmers, renewed both the general and the young trained farmers' stock reliefs; renewed stamp duty relief for farm consolidation and the accelerated rate of capital allowances for investment in pollution control facilities.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1239	A new REPS 4 scheme was launched in late 2007 as part of the new Rural Development Programme.  For the first time, REPS is open to more intensive farmers and this has the potential to bring numbers to the targeted level. The level of participation at the end of 2006, when REPS 3 closed to new applications, was approx 59,000. By 15 May 2008, the closing date for 2008 REPS 4 applications, some 10,700 farmers had applied to join REPS 4.  Some 5,000 of those had never been in REPS before. Currently there are in excess of 62,000 in all REP schemes.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1240	The land area under organic production at the end of 2008 was 44,751 hectares compared to 41,122 hectares at the end of 2007, an increase of almost 9%. This represents slightly over 1% of the total utilisable agricultural area.To assist in achieving the Programme for Government target, my Department launched its Organic Farming Action Plan 2008-2012 in April 2008. The Plan was drawn up by officials within my Department in conjunction with officials from Bord Bia and Teagasc, along with input from all the stakeholders on the National Steering Group and sub Groups. The Action Plan has four main objectives: to increase production in line with market trends, to increase the knowledge base, to develop the organic market at home and abroad and encourage the development of public procurement opportunities for organic products. There are 64 actions listed in the Plan, which is reviewed on an ongoing basis by the National Steering Group for the Development of the Organic Sector. Some of the 64 actions recommended, including the allocation of additional milk quota to organic producers, have already been completed and significant progress has been made on a number of others. Teagasc also produced its first Organic Production Business Plan in 2008 and many of the actions outlined in this have been incorporated into my Department's Action Plan.The financial incentives are in place to encourage new participants into the organic sector. The new Organic Farming Scheme, under the Rural Development Programme 2007 to 2013, aims at encouraging producers to respond to the market demand for organic food.  It was launched in August 2007 with a 17% increase in payment rates in line with the Towards 2016 Agreement.  One significant change in the new Programme is that organic producers can obtain organic support payments without having to join REPS. This is designed to encourage small-scale horticultural producers to convert to organic production, and also conventional tillage producers to convert part or even all of their holdings. Organic producers will still, of course, be able to join REPS as well, and I will be encouraging them to do so.The new capital Grant-Aid Schemes were launched in 2007 June and they provide grant aid for investments by farmers and processors in equipment and facilities.  The Schemes provide grant aid of 40% of the cost up to a maximum grant of €60,000 in the case of on-farm investments and €500,000 for investments off-farm, over the lifetime of the Schemes. In 2008, almost €1.5m was provided in grant aid for investment in equipment and facilities.One of the main initiatives to encourage farmers to adopt organic farming methods is through the organic demonstration farm programme. The programme was once again a huge success in 2008 and was expanded to include a total of 21 farms in 2008. In keeping with the procedure adopted in previous years, new farms were introduced into the programme to give a wider geographical and sectoral spread than heretofore.National Organic Week is now in its fourth year and continues to grow from strength to strength. The objective of National Organic Week is to raise awareness among consumers and the public in general as to what is meant by organic food, its benefits and where to buy it. Other initiatives in 2008 included the hosting of a National Organic Food Conference in the Waterford Institute of Technology in September 2008 and the National Organic Awards. The National Organic Food Conference brought together many key players from across the industry including producers, processors, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and restaurateurs. The National Organic Awards were held at the prestigious SHOP retail event in the Royal Dublin Society and was an ideal opportunity for producers to promote their products.The availability of advice and training has increased greatly in the last couple of years with training courses now available countrywide. This development, allied to the expanding demonstration farm programme, should further facilitate producers considering the organic option.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1241	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1197, 1198, 1204, 1205, 1207 and 1208 together.A good deal of work has been undertaken on drafting the new Animal Health and Welfare Bill which will give effect to a number of commitments in the area of animal health and welfare contained in the Programme for Government. In particular the new Bill will amend and consolidate previous legislation to reflect the changed disease status of our animals and update existing legislation, to ensure that the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) is properly protected and that penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The proposed legislation will provide for the consolidation of responsibility for the welfare of all animals within my Department and the promotion of the highest standards of animal welfare at all levels of the food production chain.My officials have met with a number of organisations that made submissions on the draft Bill following the public consultation process initiated by me last year. This element of the consultation process provided an opportunity for parties to elaborate on their respective submissions and account will be taken of all comments received in drafting the legislation.With regard to the commitment to establish ‘Biosecurity Ireland', the position is that my Department has comprehensive arrangements in place for the development, promotion and delivery of biosecurity measures, which play a vital part in preventing the spread of animal diseases and provides for coordination and cooperation among all stakeholders in dealing with any disease outbreaks. The new Animal Health and Welfare Bill aims to enhance arrangements for the prevention, control and eradication of animal diseases and will include powers to apply a range of controls to deal with all existing or potential animal diseases and outbreaks or the risks associated with diseases or outbreaks.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, consideration is being given to how those functions might be better performed by a new division of my Department taking account of best international practice and experience and Ireland's place within the EU and our application of EU rules.My Department's Veterinary and Agriculture Laboratories at Backweston continue to increase their range of diagnostic services to underpin any challenges to animal, plant health or food safety and deliver consistent principles and approaches in the area of biosecurity.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1244	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1201 and 1224 together.In December 2007, my Department submitted to the European Commission draft national legislation that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultrymeat and sheepmeat and on food products containing over 70% of these meats. During the past year my Department has been in extensive communication with the Commission with a view to justifying and pressing the case for the proposed legislation. The Commission, however, adopted a negative opinion in relation to our proposal on the grounds that it was not consistent with the EU labelling directive. This negative opinion was formally adopted at a meeting of the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in December 2008.My Department will continue to press for compulsory country of origin labelling in the context of the Commission's proposal for a new regulation on food information. The Department of Health and Children is the lead Department on this subject.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1245	Food labelling legislation and nutritional claims on food come within the remit of my colleague, the Minister of Health and Children and are primarily covered by EU Regulations. Under Article 13 of EU Regulation 1924/06, Member States are responsible for providing the European Commission with national lists of health claims, based on scientific evidence of effectiveness, by 31 January 2008. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will then assess submissions from all Member States.  By 31st January 2010, the European Commission will adopt a final list of permitted health claims. The claims on the Community list will be the only health claims allowed on food products from that date onwards.   However, two national programmes which are operated on behalf of my Department — the School Milk Scheme and the Food Dude Scheme — convey the benefits of good nutritional intake. The school milk scheme has a range of milk products on offer including flavoured milk, low-fat and fortified options to encourage milk consumption.  The National Food Dude Programme has among its objectives the increased consumption of fresh fruit & vegetables among school children during school time and at home as well as a change in parental behaviour towards purchase and consumption of fresh fruit & vegetables. This programme which is being introduced on a phased basis has reached some 1000 schools to date.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1246	The Department of Health and Children has primary responsibility for the National Strategy for Tackling Obesity.My Department has a role in promoting healthy food production and consumption. Following favourable reaction to the Irish pilot Food Dude programme (including an award by the WHO), a Healthy Eating Initiative was launched in February 2007 to make the Food Dude programme available nationally in primary schools. The programme, which is managed by Bord Bia, uses repeat tasting of fruit and vegetables, rewards and peer models to effect attitudinal and behavioural change.  To date the programme has reached over 100,000 children and over 3 million pieces of fruit & vegetables have been distributed through the programme to date.The EU is also working on a proposal for national school fruit schemes, to be introduced at the start of the 2009/2010 school year.  The regulatory provisions are modelled on Ireland's Food Dude Scheme, the success of which was repeatedly acknowledged during the negotiations.   The EU budget for the scheme is limited, with an indicative allocation of €851,000 for Ireland in the first year, but the Commission has indicated that the overall budget of €90m may be increased when the scheme is reviewed on the basis of the experience gained from implementing it.  Work has commenced on planning to get optimum value from the funding available.The School Milk Scheme, which was re-launched in 2006, continues to promote a positive nutritional message.My Department is also working with the Department of Health and Children on the Irish input for the High Level Group set up under the Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity related health issues. This will include research being funded by the Department on reducing the salt content of foods under the FIRM programme and proposals under the Department/Health Research Board initiative.This Department also funds Food Consumption databases under FIRM. The findings of a study of primary school children study have been taken up by policy makers, nutritionists and industry in tackling obesity.  The findings of subsequent study benchmarking the dietary intakes of a nationally representative sample of Irish teenagers, which was carried out by the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance (IUNA) at UCD and UCC with funding under FIRM and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, were highlighted at an open workshop in January 2008.  Further funding was also awarded in December 2007 under the joint DAFF/Health Research Board Food for Health Research Initiative for a research programme to develop new and existing food consumption databases.As a significant strategic contribution to the campaign to reduce salt levels in food, this Department awarded funding of over €2 million in 2006 for 3 research projects under FIRM. This initiative includes funding for research into new products with lower salt levels, with particular emphasis on breads, ready meals and snack foods.  The research is proceeding satisfactorily and ongoing engagement with the food industry is a feature of the research outputs.

Following consultations in recent months with relevant stakeholders including farming, industry, service providers and relevant state agency representatives, there is broad agreement on the establishment of an industry-led, national co-ordinating body to be known as Animal Health Ireland. This body will deal with non-statutory diseases and will operate as a partnership between the relevant stakeholders and Government with the aim of enhancing on-farm productivity and providing the necessary infrastructure to deal with the challenges posed to the Irish livestock industry by global competition.Animal Health Ireland will be managed by a Steering Group that will act as the Board of the organisation. In November last I appointed Mr Mike Magan to chair the interim Steering Group. The other members of the Group appointed by me comprise individuals with competencies in areas such as livestock farming, veterinary science, agricultural economics and international marketing. The Steering Group will report to a Stakeholders Group, which will be representative of the founding organisations that have financed the initiative and will have overall responsibility for the strategic direction of the organisation. There will also be a small number of Executive staff with responsibility for implementing agreed strategies.The establishment of Animal Health Ireland, which is modelled on successful international examples, in particular in Australia and the Nordic countries will facilitate Ireland achieving international best practice in the area of animal health, which all stakeholders agree will be a critical contributor to the competitiveness of Irish agriculture and optimal farm efficiency and profitability.I will formally launch Animal Health Ireland at an inaugural meeting of the Stakeholder Group tomorrow.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1250	The 5-year Animal Welfare, Recording and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Herds came into operation in January 2008. It aims to encourage and underpin the adoption of high standards of animal welfare in suckler herds and to improve the quality of breeding cattle in the beef sector. Almost 54,000 suckler farmers have joined and 85% of all the suckler cows in the country are now covered by the scheme.My Department paid out €33 million under the scheme in 2008.  It is expected that a further €44 million will be paid out in 2009. Section WRCCC follows.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1251	The first priority of government is to ensure the safety of all food produced, distributed and sold in Ireland and abroad.  This is done through the independent Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) (under the aegis of the Minister for Health & Children) The FSAI has full powers for the enforcement of food safety legislation. My Department, like other Departments and Agencies whose activities impinge on food safety operates under a service contract with the FSAI in delivering specific measures relating to certain products of animal origin.  Food Quality is a key value of the Irish food and beverages industry and there is a range of measures in place to ensure quality and sustainable production.  These include the cross compliance requirements of the Single Payment Scheme as well as REPS and similar other schemes to ensure production in an environmentally friendly manner whilst respecting animal welfare. In addition, Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board, has Quality Assurance Schemes (QAS) in place for beef, lamb, pigmeat, poultry, eggs and horticultural produce, which promote high standards at producer and processor level and provide assurance to consumers and retailers on quality, origin and safety.  The QAS are independently verified and accredited to international standards (EN45011) and play a significant part in the promotion and marketing of food and horticultural products.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1252	In line with the specific commitment in the Programme for Government, since Bord Bia launched its new European Beef Promotion Campaign in 2005, the volume of Irish beef exported to the European retail market has grown significantly from 145,000 tonnes in 2005 to 245,000 tonnes in 2007.  The major EU retail chains now list Irish beef and over 95% of total exports go into the high value EU markets compared to just 50% as recently as 2000.  Bord Bia's marketing strategy for the beef sector identified strong potential gains of €170m during the 2008 to 2013 period. Bord Bia will provide invaluable expertise in differentiating and repositioning Irish beef within the areas identified. 60,000 tonnes of Irish beef will be moved up the value chain to secure improved returns.  This will also involve a joint effort by producers and processors on specialised production of the best eating quality beef for each of the different and discerning customer segments in Europe.One of the major strategy implementation initiatives implemented by Bord Bia during 2008 was the European Meat Forum (EMF), which attracted 194 buyers, importers and media with an interest in premium meat products, from 16 European countries.  Buyer feedback from the event was overwhelmingly positive, with 65% of surveyed buyers indicating that it increased their likelihood to purchase premium Irish meat.  The EMF, combined with ongoing activities in the markets in conjunction with industry, involving both existing and potential customers across retail and foodservice, led to the following achievements during 2008:17 new retail premium product listings;7 new foodservice premium product listings;5 new accounts being secured.This means Irish beef is now listed by 68 retailers across Europe and represents a significant first step in the successful implementation of our marketing strategy. My Department is committed to continuing intensive efforts, in conjunction with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs to the development of new export opportunities for Irish meat exporters.  A special Market Access Group, with industry representatives, has been set up to monitor developments and oversee the process.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1253	My Department provided funding of €114 million towards investment in dairy processing and a total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance under the Fund, which will generate an estimated capital spend of €286 million at full production.  The purpose of the Fund is to increase the efficiency of the main dairy outputs by supporting the upgrading of plant and buildings.  This will assist operators in capturing new business in global markets and in developing new valued added products.  Three of those projects have already been completed and others are progressing to the implementation phase, which will continue during 2009.

Within the dairy sector, FIRM funded research is ongoing on milk, cheese, new food ingredients, manufacturing and processing which will support the development of the sector including new products.  Support for research projects will continue within future budget availability.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1255	The Farm Improvement Scheme (FIS) introduced in 2007 extended grant-aid to feeding systems and increased the specific investment ceilings for milking machines and bulk milk tanks from €16,000 to €40,000 and €25,000 respectively. Overall expenditure under the Farm Improvement Scheme in 2007 and 2008 was in excess of €12.9million.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1256	Good progress is being made in implementing the recommendations of the Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group. While most of the group's recommendations are to be implemented by the industry itself, a number of them fall within the remit of my Department and the state agencies under my aegis.  The position regarding these recommendations is set out below.A new company called ‘Sheep Ireland' which will take over the Department's current breed improvement programme has been established to develop a new programme.  An Interim Sheep Board, comprising representatives of farming organizations and breeders has been established to oversee this process, with ICBF providing the technical and professional service required.My Department secured European Commission approval for a new supplementary measure in REPS 4 promoting mixed grazing of cattle and sheep.  Under this supplementary measure a farmer can qualify for an annual payment of up to €1000 in addition to his or her basic REPS payment.A trial to examine the feasibility of mechanical carcase classification for lamb was conducted last year.  The results of this trial are being analysed.  It is hoped that the system will allow for the accurate and objective mechanical classification of lamb carcases and it will gain universal industry support.The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established in 2007.  This Scheme which is operated by Bord Bia has 7000 participants and it is hoped to increase the participation rate during the current year.Bord Bia has intensified its efforts to promote lamb on home and export markets.  Together with its UK and French counterparts it is part of a generic lamb promotion campaign on the important French market.Teagasc has developed a comprehensive plan to restructure its sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which include hill and lowland areas.The actions being taken by my Department and the state agencies under its aegis complement those being taken by industry. I am satisfied that taken together all of these actions will be of significant benefit to the sheep sector.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1257	A new company called ‘Sheep Ireland' which will take over the Department's current breed improvement programme has been established to develop a new programme.  An Interim Sheep Board, comprising representatives of farming organisations and breeders has been established to oversee this process, with ICBF providing the technical and professional service required.  Teagasc has also launched an initiative on an enhanced research and advice programme involving the establishment of Technology Evaluation and Transfer (TET) farms in both hill and lowland areas.  The Farm Improvement Scheme included the possibility of support for improved housing and other facilities in the sheep sector.  However, the scheme was closed for new applicants on 31 October 2007 as its funding ceiling had been reached.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1258	The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme operated by Bord Bia was established in 2007 and has 7000 participants.  Bord Bia is also actively engaged in the marketing and promotion of sheepmeat at home and abroad.  Some €1 million annually is spent on these activities which are targeted at the needs of particular markets. Currently, Bord Bia along with its French and British counterparts, is undertaking a generic lamb promotion campaign on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.  In relation to labelling, my Department has actively pursued country of origin labelling for pigmeat, poultrymeat and sheepmeat.  The European Commission has, however, rejected our proposals. Notwithstanding this, my Department will continue to pursue the issue in the context of the proposed new food information Directive, for which the Department of Health and Children is the lead Department.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1259	Significant progress has been made in enhancing the specific quality assurance schemes for the cereals, pigmeat and poultry sectors.  The Irish Grain Assurance Scheme (IGAS) assures customers that grain is produced, handled, stored and transported according to a defined Code of Practice.  Almost 6,000 cereals producers are now participating in the scheme, which accounts for approximately 90% of grain traded in Ireland.  The Department has supported the objectives of the Scheme in a tangible way under the National Development Plan by the provision of grant aid towards the improvement of grain handling and storage facilities both on-farm and at commercial intake points.The Pigmeat Quality Assurance Scheme (QAS) is now fully accredited under EN45011 at producer and processor level.  There are 230 registered members of the Pigmeat Quality Assurance Scheme (QAS), of which 158 are certified at producer level.  Farm inspections and processor audits are ongoing with certifications taking place once the required standards have been achieved.The Poultry Products Quality Assurance Scheme incorporates the requirements that were previously included in chicken, turkey and duck standards.  Both the Processor and Producer standards of the new Scheme have been accredited to EN45011 by the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB).  Training of all participants (plant personnel, processors' farm inspectors, producers and Bord Bia auditors) has taken place.Egg QAS: The new Packing Centre and Producer (including Rearer Requirements) Standards have been presented to and approved by Bord Bia's Technical Advisory.  The Standard will be submitted to the Irish National Accreditation Board for assessment under the rules of EN45011.  This will be a continuation of the scope of accreditation of the EQAS, not a new application since the EQAS was already accredited.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1261	The EU prohibits national supports which are targeted at import substitution.  The fruit and vegetable sector contributed approx €213.7m to farm output in 2007, an increase of 14% over 2000.  Figures are not yet available for 2008 but a significant change is not expected.  The sector has considerable potential for further development but it is experiencing strong competitive pressures, particularly from the highly concentrated retail chains and from imports.  The mushroom sector, 90% of whose production is for export to the UK, is currently facing serious problems because of the developments in the sterling exchange rate.Under the National Development Plan 2007 –2013, exchequer funding  is being provided for the horticulture sector over the period of the plan.  This will continue the modernisation process for on-farm investments, and marketing and processing facilities that was initiated in the 2000 –2006 NDP.  The new scheme for the development of commercial horticulture was approved by the EU Commission under State Aid rules in October 2007.  In 2008 almost €6m was paid out to 137 producers.  The scheme for 2009 was launched in December 2008 with a closing date for receipt of applications of 16 January 2009.  In addition, the EU Producer Organisation (PO) Scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base.  The Scheme has more flexible terms with effect from 2009 and it is hoped that this will attract more growers to join POs. Since 2000, twenty POs have benefited from EU funding amounting to €29.4m.

Under the new FEPS an additional premium of up to €200 per hectare for five years is available to farmers in REPS who join FEPS.  The target of 30% broadleaf planting has been achieved in 2005 and 2006. This broadleaf planting target remains in place for the 2007-2013 programming period with higher premiums payable for broadleaf species.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1264	My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc and COFORD have been actively encouraging the development of new markets for forest thinnings in the heat energy sector through a range of support measures aimed at creating an effective supply chain from producer to end user.  Since 2006 COFORD (National Council for Forest Research and Development), which is wholly funded by my Department, has been managing the Forest Energy Programme in association with Teagasc and Waterford Institute of Technology.  To date, the programme has operated a series of nationwide forest thinning and chipping demonstrations, and undertaken a series of trials and workshops aimed at developing the wood biomass supply chain.  During 2007 and 2008 my Department provided grants totalling €550,000 under the Wood Biomass Harvesting Machinery Scheme to support the purchase of 4 self contained/self propelled whole tree chippers and 3 mobile whole tree chippers, stimulating an associated investment of some €1.6m within the woodchip energy supply sector.My Department also supports individual projects and initiatives which focus specifically on wood-energy.  It has provided financial support to the County Clare Wood Energy and the Donegal Forest Link projects and has also provided start up funding to a number of farm forest owner producer groups in Kerry, Clare, Cork, Galway, Donegal and Wicklow to enable farm forest owners to work collectively in the management and marketing of their forests. A number of these groups are concentrating on creating a demand for wood energy by promoting the installation of biomass boilers by large energy users in their localities and creating a reliable wood chip supply chain.  My Department has also provided financial assistance to a number of start up enterprises in Clare, Meath, Offaly, Tipperary and Wexford involved in the production and supply of solid log, woodchip and wood pellet products to the commercial and domestic heat sectors.  These measures are aimed at stimulating the supply of wood energy, thereby complementing schemes such as the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat) and Greener Homes Scheme operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1265	My Department promotes the establishment of new forests through a range of attractive support measures, namely the Afforestation Grant Scheme, the Forest Environment Protection Scheme and the Native Woodland Scheme.  These schemes provide 100% establishment grants and annual premiums for up to 20 years. During 2007 and 2008 my Department provided grants totalling €550,000 under the Wood Biomass Harvesting Machinery Scheme to support the purchase of 4 self contained/self propelled whole tree chippers and 3 mobile whole tree chippers, stimulating an associated investment of some €1.6m within the woodchip energy supply sector.  All forests operate as sinks to combat climate change.  The estimated sequestration rate of Ireland's eligible forests (i.e. those planted since 1990) for the 1st year of the Kyoto commitment period (2008) is 1.7 million tonnes of CO2.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1266	Following a full review and consultation with the sector, the FEPS scheme has been amended and rolled out as an established scheme. The threshold of 8 hectares has been reduced to 5 hectares for small farms (less than 30ha), attracting a €150/ha rate for plantations between 5 and 8 ha, and €200/ha thereafter. At the other end of the scale, a standard rate of €200/ha applies for all plantations, irrespective of the size of the farm, on which they are established.  (Previously a payment sliding scale applied, whereby the FEPS payment reduced progressively in line with the relevant REPS payment).

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1268	The primary responsibility for renewable energy rests with the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources (D/CENR) and my Department is participating in a new Renewable Energy Development Group established by D/CENR to consider the challenges and opportunities facing the Irish renewable energy sector.  A sectoral sub-group on Bioenergy has been established to prepare a "Sustainable Bioenergy Supply Roadmap for Ireland".  The Roadmap will identify policy options and propose programmes where necessary to achieve a sustainable supply of biomass.  A scoping study is being commissioned to provide a detailed framework for the roadmap.The work of this sub-group is being informed by the National Bioenergy Action Plan, which was published in 2006 to ensure delivery of a co-ordinated inter-Departmental action plan on bioenergy.  The Plan sets out an integrated strategy to exploit Ireland's bioenergy resources including non- food crops across the agriculture, enterprise, transport, environment and energy sectors.  My Department is implementing a number of Actions to incentivise cultivation of non-food crops.  The measures include a National Energy Crop Premium worth €80/ha and a Bioenergy Scheme worth €1,450/ha to encourage farmers to grow willow and miscanthus.  Areas planted with non-food crops also qualify for the Single farm payment.  Some 5,000 hectares of energy crops were planted in 2008.  My Department is also funding research projects that relate directly to non-food crops.  The aim of this research is to identify and select plant varieties and crop production systems that are most suited to biofuel production in the Irish context.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1269	The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recognises the crucial role that research can play in the development of biofuels and biomass in Ireland.  In recent years, our support for research in this area has been greatly enhanced under the Department's Research Stimulus Fund Programme.  Under Stimulus Calls in 2005, 2006 and 2007, 13 projects were awarded grant assistance of almost €6.4 million.  The projects cover a broad spectrum of bioenergy themes and involve research into liquid biofuels from non-food crops, energy from on-farm anaerobic digestion, the potential of Irish grassland as a source of bioenergy and the feasibility of producing second-generation biofuel from lignocellulosic feedstocks.  Projects supported under the Stimulus programme will complement the research work being done by Teagasc and others in this area.

My Department implements the agriculture related actions in the Action Plan to increase the share of bioenergy derived from the agriculture and forestry related sectors.  The measures include a National Energy Crop Premium worth €80 per hectare and an EU premium worth €45 per hectare to stimulate energy crop cultivation.  A Bioenergy Scheme was also launched to provide establishment grants of €1,450 per hectare to farmers interested in planting willow and miscanthus.  To support the wood energy market, grant aid of €1.2 million has been made available under the Wood Biomass Harvesting Scheme to aid the purchase of specialist wood energy equipment.  Other supports for forestry include 100% grants and annual premiums to encourage increased afforestation.  My Department also provided grant-aid of €4 million for ten on-farm anaerobic digestion projects in 2007 under the Scheme of Investment Aid for Demonstration On-Farm Waste Processing Facilities.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1271	In February 2007, my Department launched a new Bioenergy Scheme providing establishment grants to farmers to grow miscanthus and willow.  The grants are worth €1,450 per hectare.  Some 1,800 hectares were grant aided in 2007 & 2008.  The third phase was launched in December 2008 and will support the planting of a further 1,800 hectares in 2009.  In addition to establishment grants, farmers who grow willow and miscanthus qualify for the €45/ha EU premium, the €80/ha National Energy Crop Premium and adjusted payments under the REPS and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme subject to some restrictions on the areas planted.  Areas planted with willow and miscanthus also qualify for the Single Farm Payment.  The Department has also made available Best Practice guidelines for growing willow and miscanthus under the Bioenergy Scheme.  The guide provides advice to growers on planting and harvesting operations to maximise crop yield and improve the economic viability of the crop.  Together with Teagasc and Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Department co-funded an educational DVD "Willow & Miscanthus — From Field To Furnace" to advise producers on the planting, crop management, harvesting and storage of these crops.  Teagasc has also published a Farm Diversification Manual, which provides detailed technical advice to farmers on the cultivation of willow and miscanthus.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1272	The new Organic Farming Scheme, under the Rural Development Programme 2007 to 2013, aims at encouraging producers to respond to the market demand for organic food.  It was launched in August 2007 with a 17% increase in payment rates in line with the Towards 2016 Agreement.  One significant change in the new Programme is that organic producers can obtain organic support payments without having to join REPS.  This is designed to encourage small-scale horticultural producers to convert to organic production, and also conventional tillage producers to convert part or even all of their holdings.  Organic producers will still, of course, be able to join REPS as well, and I will be encouraging them to do so.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1273	Bord Bia continually assists producers and market organisers on sales, marketing and product development and its guide on "Alternative Routes to Market" provides action plans and guidelines to assist growers and food entrepreneurs who wish to set up in business through Farmers' Markets, farm shops and box schemes. Bord Bia has also developed the exceptionally successful market in Farmleigh in partnership with the Office of Public Works (OPW), has worked closely with Dublin City Council on the Smithfield market project and sponsored the RTE television series ‘Fresh from the Farmers Market' in 2007 and 2008.  Filming on the 2008 series featured 16 markets, 24 producers and 8 Feile Bia restaurants from around the country.  An all-Ireland St Patrick's Day food market was held in Covent Garden London on 15 and 16 March 2008. Approximately 50 artisan producers took space in the market selling a wide range of produce including farmhouse cheeses, traditional breads, smoked fish, and luxury confectionery.Bord Bia and Teagasc work closely with the Irish Farmers' Market Traders Association on developing a training course for establishing Farmers Markets and a strategic approach to their development.  Teagasc has run 3 training programme for "Direct Selling" designed to meet the needs of traders involved in Farmers' Markets.  In January 2008 the Department with support from Bord Bia held a forum for local authorities to discuss local food issues and to promote local authority involvement and support for Farmers' Markets.  Presentations were made on examples of local and international farmers markets and on a Bord Bia survey of Farmers' Markets organisers and workshops were held to identify the potential for farmers markets.  In July 2008, two groups were established, which are chaired by my Department, to examine, respectively, the development of best practice guidelines and to consider possible statutory guidelines to further the development of farmers markets.  The best practice group has engaged in public consultation and placed a call in the National Press inviting submissions from interested parties on what might be included in guidelines.  A total of 30 submissions were received and the different views expressed are being examined.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1276	My Department supports Bord Bia in promoting the marketing of quality food on a range of markets and in communicating directly with international buyers via market/sector specific publications and events regarding the qualities, systems and production values of our agri-food production including horticulture.  Bord Bia has developed a programme of Quality Assurance Schemes in beef, beef, lamb, pigmeat, poultry, eggs and horticultural produce.  These Schemes promote high standards at producer and processor level and provide assurance to consumers and retailers on quality, origin and safety.  They are independently verified and accredited to international standards (EN45011) and play a significant part in the promotion and marketing of food and horticultural products.  My Department's public good food research programme, FIRM, is also funding research to enhance links between traceability systems and marketing of produce by developing protocols using unique animal biometrics and biomarkers to assist in identifying the particular attributes of grass-based products and further protect our marketing image.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1284	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1252 and 1253 together.Waste management is primarily a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The control authorities for water, nitrates and integrated pollution are the Environmental Protection Agency and/or local authorities.  My Department has taken significant steps in assisting farmers to meet their obligation under the nitrates regulations by implementing the revised Farm Waste Management Scheme.  This successful capital investment scheme incurred expenditure of €113.9 million and €413.7 million in 2007 and 2008 respectively.  The Farm Waste Management Scheme also introduced higher grant rates to encourage farmers to invest in more environmentally friendly slurry-spreading equipment and these were also continued in the 2007 Farm Improvement Scheme.  In addition, under the cross-compliance arrangements for the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), my Department carries out checks on farms in receipt of these payments to verify compliance with the requirements of the nitrates regulations.  It has also produced an Explanatory Handbook, held information meetings for farmers and provided statements to farmers of nitrogen and phosphorus produced on their farms.

In 2008 a total of 746 students enrolled in further level training programmes bringing the total overall number participating in these programmes to 3,480.  In addition Teagasc collaborates with Institutes of Technology to deliver 11 higher level training programmes to degree level and beyond.  In 2008 a total of 313 students enrolled in higher level training programmes bringing the total number participating in these programmes to 956.During 2008 a total of 387 students participated in the new advanced Certificate in Agriculture (180 hour replacement) course.  150 participants are completing programmes at local level, 137 are completing on-line courses in conjunction with the 6 agricultural colleges and a further 100 commenced a new course in September with the Teagasc College.  A range of other programmes in areas such as Food Safety, Horticulture and Information Technology are delivered on-line.  In addition there is a comprehensive programme of Advanced Certificate in Agriculture courses for part-time farmers throughout the country.  These courses are held largely at night and weekends to facilitate these farmers.  There are a total of 16 courses now running with a total of 503 participants.  Of these nine courses commenced in 2008 with a total of 306 participants.  In addition to the courses above, an on-line course for poultry producers was developed and delivered in 2008.All mainstream training programmes include modules on education courses, start your own business and farm planning. In addition the Options Planning Programme, a central component of Teagasc's Advisory Service, takes farm families through a formal planning process to identify new development pathways and/or referral to diversification and business start-up programmes.  Well in excess of 2,000 farm families were taken through this process in 2008.  Additional specialists have been appointed in the areas of artisan food and rural tourism, equines, renewable energy and organic production.  Two food technologists have also been appointed.  This will enable a greater number of farmers to avail of specialist training and support services in all of these areas.  In June 2008, a major national flagship event FarmFest & Bioenergy 08 was held in Teagasc Athenry.  The central theme of this event was the role of Teagasc in helping to build sustainable rural communities.  An exhibit of some 350 small on-farm diversification businesses formed a major part of the event.  Some 30,000 people attended.  An "All Island" Innovation for rural business awards programme was also established in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland to incentivise and support farmers to develop business ideas in areas including, environment, energy, manufacturing, technology, tourism, value added food and services.  Over 80 small business projects were entered for these awards in 2008 and the awards continue in 2009.A review of college infrastructure was undertaken by an outside consultancy body and was finalised early in 2008 and agreed by the Teagasc Authority.  Four colleges, (three Teagasc colleges and one private college) were prioritised in terms of future capital expenditure.  The remaining four colleges of which three are private colleges and one Teagasc college will be required to deliver the overall Teagasc Education Programme and together with Teagasc senior management are agreeing a work programme to ensure their future viability.  In 2008 the Salesian order decided to discontinue the provision of horticultural education at Warrenstown College, Co. Meath from June 2009.  The staff, students and programmes are being integrated into the Teagasc horticultural college at the National Botanic Gardens.

My Department provided over €100 million in Exchequer funding to Teagasc by way of Grant-in-Aid to support Teagasc's agri-food research programme and activities in 2007 and 2008.  This funding supplements Teagasc's own generated income.    My Department also funds grants for research, which has been undertaken by Teagasc and other research bodies following public calls for research proposals under the competitive Research Stimulus and FIRM programmes operated by my Department.   Many projects are for three year periods.The Research Stimulus Fund Programme supports public good research by third level research institutions to fill gaps in research into sustainable agricultural production. Following a new call in 2007, €21m including some IDC funding was awarded to a total of 38 projects in the areas of plant bioscience, agri-energy, agri-environment & agri economy & policy.Under the Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM), which supports public good research in the food area, €19 m was awarded in 2008 to food research institutions under a new call for projects in key areas of food research. This initiative supported research in the areas of food quality and safety, manufacturing & processing technologies, new uses for food and drink by-products, innovative food ingredients and products, and a ‘Frontiers Theme' to fund the science base for new ideas to create future opportunities for the food industry public good research projects in 2008.The Department has also awarded funding of €5m under a collaborative research initiative with the Marine Institute in the area of marine functional foods, and €20m under a Food for Health collaborative research initiative with the Health Research Board in the theme areas of "Food safety Monitoring and Surveillance", "Nutrigenomics", "Food Consumption databases" and "Nutritional Health in the Elderly". This included innovative collaborations with the Marine Institute and the Health Research Board.The NDP also provides a further €289 million for investment in capital infrastructure and marketing for the food industry. To date under the NDP, €130 million has been announced in awards for capital investment projects.  In addition, Bord Bia has received funding for marketing and promotion activities in the food and horticulture sectors.Following the Government Decision on the rationalisation of State Agencies this European Marketing Section is to transfer to Bord Bia whose statutory function to promote, assist and develop the marketing of Irish food and livestock. As a result, the food, horticultural and seafood sectors should be better served by the combined expertise of an amalgamated body, which can bring together the synergies necessary to promote and market these sectors. The core elements of seafood marketing are common to those carried out by Bord Bia in other food sectors. This includes the provision of market research and intelligence, trade development activities and food and drink promotion.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1297	Significant progress has been made over the last number of years towards developing Ireland's reputation as a centre of excellence for marine research.Sea Change, A Marine Knowledge, Research & Innovation Strategy for Ireland 2007-2013, was launched by Government in February 2007.  Sea Change aims to drive the development of Ireland's marine sector as a dynamic element of our knowledge economy.  It aims to bring about a transformation of the marine sector from a traditional one which is primarily associated with food harvesting to one which is multifaceted, embracing a range of new, high value, knowledge-intensive, commercial opportunities developed in a sustainable manner.  In doing so it addresses the aims of the wider National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) of placing Ireland firmly on the global map in terms of the excellence of our research and its application for the benefit of society.The Marine Institute, who are tasked with implementing Sea Change, manages a programme of research funding (the Marine Research Sub Programme of the 2007-'13 NDP) aimed at achieving the objectives of Sea Change.  In addition, the Marine Institute works closely with a range of agencies (e.g. Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, Higher Education Authority, and the Environmental Protection Agency) with a view to leveraging additional funds for marine research from respective NDP programmes.Significant progress has been achieved during the first two years of Sea Change (2007-'08).  Over €75m of exchequer funding (via a range of agencies/funding schemes) has been invested in marine research and innovation during 2007-'08, providing funding for a significant suite of research, development and innovation programmes and projects, carried out by a range of research and industry partners, over a 1-7 year timeframe..  This investment is targeted across all 15 research programmes in Sea Change; including marine food (fisheries, aquaculture and seaweed), ocean energy and the emerging areas of marine functional foods, marine biotechnology and advanced marine technology.  Investment/progress to date includes:A suite of fisheries research projects aimed at broadening understanding of fish stocks, capturing the inherent knowledge of the fishing industry, improving scientific advice for stakeholders, and rebuilding depleted fish stocks.Research support for the diversification of the aquaculture industry through the development of cod and seaweed aquaculture industries and projects aimed at addressing finfish/shellfish health and food safety issues.The establishment of an Ocean Energy Development Unit located within Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and funding to support and develop a state-of-the-art National Ocean Energy facility and a grid-connected wave energy test site, to enable development of commercial wave energy devices.The establishment of a new collaborative Centre of Excellence in Marine Functional Foods aimed at building on Ireland's considerable international food research reputation and targeting the marine as a source of novel ingredients.A programme of marine climate change research, in close liaison with EPA and Met Éireann, is leading to increased understanding of the drivers and regulators of climate and improving the accuracy and reliability of predictive models.Ireland has developed a reputation internationally for its work on seabed mapping through one of the largest marine mapping programmes in the world.  Between 1999 and 2005 the Irish National Seabed Survey project, managed by the Geological Survey of Ireland, mapped all Irish designated waters over 200 m water depth and a considerable area shallower than that. This provided a ground-breaking dataset of bathymetric, geophysical, oceanographic, and ancillary datasets to support a range of economic and research activities.  INFOMAR (Integrated Mapping For the sustainable development of Ireland's Marine Resource), the successor programme to the seabed survey, managed jointly by the Marine Institute and Geological Survey of Ireland, is prioritising mapping of bays and coastal areas and integrating and supplying the data generated to support the development of a range of added value products and projects.  This investment will deliver significant future returns to the state in the areas of marine research and development, safety, environment, energy and infrastructure, fisheries, flood risk management, and heritage.Participation in international marine research and development initiatives and programmes contributes significantly to research and innovation capacity building. Exchequer investment in Marine Research and Development over the last number of years is paying dividends on the international research stage.  This is evidenced by the increase in Irish participation in international marine research programmes, with Irish researchers securing over €13.5 million in EU marine research projects during 2007 and 2008, versus a total of €23.1m from EU programmes over the previous funding period (2000-2006).Together, the investment in marine research over the last two years via national and international funding programmes has led to the creation of significant new research capacity and capability — with in excess of 90 new research positions and 95 PhD scholarships being created — which will contribute significantly towards furthering the goal of building Ireland's reputation as a centre of excellence for marine research.

A number of sites have also been designated in inshore waters.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is working with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and the Marine Institute to introduce arrangements that will allow for appropriate management in these sites in order to provide for their effective conservation.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1300	All fishing vessels on the Irish Sea Fishing Boat Register, and indeed all EU-registered sea fishing boats, are subject to regulation of their activities under the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy, wherever in the world they are fishing and whether they are within the territorial waters of a third country or on the high seas.With the adoption of the Council Conclusions of July 2004, the EU's bilateral fisheries relations are now based on an international legal act, known as a Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA), between the EU and each concerned third country.  The European Union has FPAs with a number of third countries worldwide, including a number of developing countries.These agreements are structured to contribute to sustainable fishing activities in the waters of the EU's partner country in accordance with the principles of the Common Fisheries Policy, as well as to enhance coherence with development cooperation policy and with other related policies, such as environment, trade and health.  A crucial element is a financial contribution from the Community to the partner state.EU vessels availing of fishing opportunities under these Agreements must apply for a licence through the Commission and the relevant partner state.  These vessels must comply with the conditions set out in the relevant Agreement.  Conditions usually include licence fees, fees per tonnes caught, quota restrictions, requirements to use local seamen, use of local port and processing facilities where available, catch reporting and requirements to co-operate with the local control and inspection authorities etc.  Vessels that breach any of the licence conditions are, of course, subject to sanction.Historically, very few Irish vessels have participated in such third country fisheries due to a lack of freezer capacity.  Ireland presently has only one freezer vessel on the Irish Sea-Fishing Boat Register.  Other difficulties, such as the long distances from home waters, high fuel and other costs, lack of adequate shore-based facilities, etc., have made such expeditions unattractive for the Irish pelagic fleet.Ireland continues to participate in negotiations between the EU and developing countries, e.g. most recently the renewal of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Mauritania.  The EU will contribute €86m per annum to the Mauritanian Exchequer under the agreement as well as licence fees for vessels fishing and fees per tonne caught.  In addition, the Agreement will represent a significant economic boost through increased landings in Mauritanian ports, local employment, etc.One Irish pelagic vessel received a licence in 2008 from the Mauritanian authorities under the EU/Mauritania Fisheries Partnership Agreement.  There are no other Irish registered vessels fishing under this or any other such agreement at present.

This provides a range of company mentoring and development services. During 2008 Business Development co-funded 29 joint BIM-Seafood company marketing projects resulting in a total 1.46 million being committed by the industry to primarily export marketing. Business Development also facilitated participation in the European Seafood Exhibition (ESE) — the world's largest seafood exhibition. At ESE 2008, 26 Irish Seafood companies showcased "the best of Irish Seafood" in the BIM Market Area Pavilion.The BIM Seafood Development Centre (SDC) supports companies' new product development efforts.European Trade Marketing — BIM has four European representative offices (Paris, Dusseldorf, Madrid and recently opened a UK office). The European offices facilitate trade relationships with key European buyers as well as organising Irish participation in European trade shows such as Biofach (Germany) and Conexmar, Spain.Following the Government Decision on the rationalization of State Agencies this European Marketing Section is to transfer to Bord Bia whose statutory function to promote, assist and develop the marketing of Irish food and livestock. As a result, the food, horticultural and seafood sectors should be better served by the combined expertise of an amalgamated body, which can bring together the synergies necessary to promote and market these sectors. The core elements of seafood marketing are common to those carried out by Bord Bia in other food sectors. This includes the provision of market research and intelligence, trade development activities and food and drink promotion.

New rules were agreed that will apply from 1/1/2010 and will give real time access to coastal states such as Ireland to fishing records of vessels in its 200 mile zone. The Department has, in conjunction with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, the Department of Defence and the Naval Service established a Project team to guide the implementation of these provisions in advance of the January 2010 deadline.

This system is administered by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.Ireland has advocated, at EU level, for other member states to also introduce similar electronic systems. In this regard Commission Regulation  (EC) No 1077/2008, which was adopted on the 3rd November 2008 lays down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1966/2006 on electronic recording and reporting of fishing activities and on means of remote sensing and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1566/2007. This regulation explicitly requires Member States to implement an Electronic Sales Note System.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1307	Following the very positive experience with Agri-Food 2010 and Agri-Vision 2015, I believe that a new development plan for the sector will be required for the period to 2020.Such a plan will need to focus on the opportunities arising, in particular, from growing international food and energy crop markets, and the challenges from the global economic downturn, currency fluctuations, climate change and other factors.  Importantly it will also have to take into account the likely shape of the CAP after 2013, on which discussion is at a very preliminary stage.Preparatory work has commenced in my Department and will be intensified in consultation with stakeholders over the course of this year.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1308	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1281 to 1283, inclusive, and 1285 together.My Department makes a quarterly return to the Department of Finance regarding the deployment of staff under the decentralisation programme and the most recent returns for Portlaoise and Clonakilty are as follows at Appendix A.In the Department's original Decentralisation Implementation Plan, it was estimated that staff turnover would be high, over 90%. The risks arising from this high turnover of staff are being mitigated by the following.Phased moves to Portlaoise to take into consideration the business needs of the Divisions concerned, to minimise the risks involved and to ensure continuity of business and the maintenance of service delivery to stakeholders during and immediately after the transition period. Successful advance moves took place in 2005, 2006 and 2007.Implementation of a Risk Assessment and Management Plan.Introduction by the Department of Finance of a number of initiatives dealing with promotion and recruitment policies relating to the Decentralisation Programme.In total 143 staff have been released to other decentralising organisations and 35 staff have been released to other Dublin based organisations through bilateral transfers and the Dublin arrangements and. In total 957 of the Department's staff have applied on the Central Applications Facility to transfer to other decentralising organisations.The original Government decision on the decentralisation of the Department was that some 600 headquarters posts would move to Portlaoise. When the pre-existing office there is taken into consideration there will be up to 850 staff in Portlaoise following completion of the programme.In 2004 the Department of Finance requested each Secretary General/Head of Office to discuss the question of decentralisation with his/her senior officers at Assistant Secretary level. Since then vacancies at this level in my Department are being filled by the Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC) on the basis that the successful candidate will decentralise at the appropriate time. I do not consider it appropriate to indicate the preferences of individual officers in the Department, but I can say that I am confident that there will be a sufficient cadre of people at this level to provide continuity of leadership and management experience as the decentralisation programme proceeds.The responsibilities of each Management Committee member and locations of their Divisions is set out as followsManagement Committee PostDivisionLocation*Agricultural Payments 1Single Payments

This Trial Licence was issued on the basis that at no time during the period of the trial licence would salmon be stocked at any one of the sites. In view of this the matter of revocation of the salmon licence did not arise.My Department has recently received a request under the Freedom of Information Acts, from the person in question, to which a response has issued.  On January 23rd 2009, a request for further additional information was received by my Department. My Department will respond to this shortly, in accordance with Freedom of Information legislation.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1313	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1289 and 1296 together.In accordance with EU legislation, my Department's National Feed Inspection Programme is part of the overall Integrated Multi-Annual Control Plan for Ireland. This Plan involves food and feed, and details must be submitted to the EU Commission. The Food and Veterinary Office of the EU Commission audits the Plan.  The EU Regulation laying down the requirements for feed hygiene clearly states that primary responsibility for feed safety rests with the feed business operator. That responsibility includes an obligation on the operator to identify hazard and critical control points (HACCP) and ensure that all appropriate actions are taken to eliminate potential risks to the feed chain.The National Feed Inspection Programme is implemented by a specially trained staff unit who carry out approximately 2,400 inspections per annum throughout the feed chain, based on risk assessment at registered establishments covering imports (amounting to approximately 800 bulk consignments per annum); 80 manufacturing mills; 17 mineral mixture plants; 80 premises supplying surplus food such as bread, dairy products and vegetables for animal feed; 2 food recycling plants; 120 grain intake depots, 690 retailers and wholesalers of animal feed; 967 transport operators; and a sample of 900 farms, including those involved in the home mixing of animal feed.  The 2 food recycling plants are registered as Feed Business Operators.In addition 1,800 samples per annum taken from the complete range of feed materials and compound feed undergo some 7,000 laboratory analyses for composition, the absence of meat and bone meal, undesirable substances and banned substances.  The level of inspections and sample-taking carried out complies with the requirements of EU legislation.Turning specifically to the dioxin incident, the food recycling premises involved was inspected in 2006 and 2007 and was scheduled for an inspection in December 2008. This inspection had not taken place by the time the contaminated bread was discovered.  However, since then the National Feed Inspection Programme has been reviewed and the Programme for 2009 will take cognisance of the following:The need to ensure that Feed Business Operators fulfil their responsibility as primary custodians of feed safety and place greater emphasis on checking their HACCP Plans. In this regard notices have issued to establishments reminding them of requirements in relation to HACCP, with particular emphasis on ensuring that the correct type of oil is used in feed/grain drying operations:Readjustment of the inspection and sampling regime in the light of the reassessment of the risk associated with drying of feed/grain.Apply an inspection regime at food recycling plants that is similar to that at premises producing compound feed.Samples are analysed for dioxins under the National Feed Programme and the National Residues Programme. The frequency of such testing is determined by risk assessment. The State Laboratory will carry out dioxin testing for the 2009 Programmes, the cost of which will form part of the State Laboratory's cost structure.The review of the National Feed Inspection Programme is consistent with the approach adopted by my Department after the BSE crisis in the nineties and the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 when the Department updated its contingency arrangements in the light of the experience gained.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1322	The first REPS 4 Plans were submitted to my Department in August 2007.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1323	Out of the 10,773 applications for REPS 4 received in my Department by the closing date of 15 May 2008, the number converting from REPS 3 to REPS 4 before the end of their REPS 3 contracts was comparatively small.  The information requested is not readily available, and its provision would require staff to be diverted from urgent work expediting REPS payments.  The average yearly payment for a REPS 3 applicant is €6,200 while the average yearly payment in REPS 4 is €7,200.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1324	My Department keeps its staffing arrangements in local offices under constant review in order to ensure that payments continue to flow in a timely manner to farmers under the Farm Waste Management and other Schemes.

It was necessary to suspend new applications for this scheme due to the budgetary situation.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1333	The Nitrates Regulations (SI No. 378 of 2006) are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the first instance. The objective of the Regulations is to protect water quality and the various provisions are designed to control the management of fertilisers, including the timing, method of application and maximum amounts that may be applied, in order to prevent fertiliser losses to water.Regarding the application of fertilisers, the EU Nitrates Directive requires Member States' Action Programmes to include rules regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited. Therefore the Nitrates Regulations specify prohibited periods during which fertilisers may not be applied to land. The purpose of these prohibited periods is to ensure that fertilisers are not applied at times of the year when crops are not growing and not able to use them and when there is a high risk of those fertilisers finding their way into waters instead.The Regulations also contain a number of requirements in relation to ploughing, such as a prohibition on ploughing of grassland between certain dates and requirements to provide for green cover within a certain period after ploughing. These provisions are designed to minimise nutrient losses from bare ground. Significant nutrient loss can occur when grassland or arable land is ploughed and where there is no crop planted shortly after ploughing to take up the nutrients that will be released when the buried organic matter breaks down.The Northern Ireland Executive introduced its Nitrates Action Programme Regulations in 2006 following a separate negotiation process with the European Commission.  Those Regulations do not permit farmers to carry out the activities mentioned above without restriction. Northern Ireland has the same prohibited period for slurry spreading as Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Donegal, from 15 October to 31 January. The Regulations in Northern Ireland also require a farmer to take steps to prevent nutrient loss after harvesting of a crop, but present different options such as the retention of stubble, sowing of a crop that will take up nitrogen or leaving the land with a rough surface, by ploughing or discing, to encourage the infiltration of rain.The contents of the Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were the subject of extensive consultation with stakeholders, including the farming bodies, and were finalised following a long period of negotiation with the EU Commission. At the conclusion of this process, the Nitrates Regulations (SI No. 378 of 2006) were made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2006 to further implement the EU Nitrates Directive. The provisions in relation to landspreading, ploughing and green cover are fundamental measures in meeting the objectives of the Directive, which is to protect waters against pollution from agricultural sources, and I am not aware of plans for a review in advance of that stipulated in the Regulations themselves.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1346	Dairy farmers incomes are comprised of the market price paid for milk and direct income support from the EU.  Market forces have a significant and increasing influence on the price paid for milk.  World market prices determine the returns received by dairy processors and these in turn are reflected in the price paid to farmers.  In essence, farm gate prices normally reflect the returns from international markets of dairy product sales.Dairy product prices reached record high levels in 2007 and early 2008 and producer prices also peaked in that time.  Since then international dairy product prices have fallen back considerably, although the average Irish producer price for 2008 was only marginally down on the 2007 price.  Indications are that markets will remain weak in the first half of 2009 and I have made clear to Commissioner Fischer Boel in recent weeks that a range of supports would help to restore confidence and put a floor under market prices.  The Commission initially responded by commencing the 2009 butter private storage scheme two months early.  Subsequently, on January 15th the Commissioner announced further measures to assist the dairy sector including a commitment under the Intervention system to purchase more than the fixed quantities of butter (30,000 tonnes) and SMP (109,000 tonnes) if the market situation requires it.  In addition, she announced the reintroduction of export refunds for butter, SMP, WMP and cheese and these were reinstated last week.During the Health Check negotiations I argued very strongly in favour of keeping critical market instruments in place and using them effectively.  These support measures can now be used to respond to price volatility in the current market situation and will benefit the milk sector in Ireland, including all dairy producers, large and small.While we are facing short-term uncertainty, analysis shows that the long-term outlook is bright.  Global growth in wealth and population will provide opportunities for quality producers like Ireland, and all areas of the dairy sector can expect to reap the rewards.  In the meantime, I will continue to monitor developments in the dairy sector closely and intervene again with the Commissioner as the market situation evolves.

Its aim is to encourage appropriate development on suckler farms in line with National and EU priorities and to assist adaptation to market requirements. Some 54,000 farmers applied for the scheme involving over 970,000 suckler cows.To date over €42 million has been paid out on 518,000 suckler cows in respect of their calves born during 2008.  A further €35 million remains in the 2009 allocation and payments will continue on an ongoing basis, as 2008 born animals become eligible.  I expect a decision to be made shortly on the rate of payment for 2009 born calves.

However, the assessment arrangements for the revised syllabus have not yet been finalised as they will have to be considered in the context of the assessment of other senior cycle science subjects, including the introduction of a second assessment component.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1391	The Programme for Government commits the provision of a dedicated fund of at least €100 million for investment in school sports facilities over five years from within the NDP allocation for school buildings.I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to promoting exercise for our children and young people– both in their community and at school. Over €2.6 billion has been provided for school building infrastructure between 2000 and 2006 and a further €4.5 billion is to be invested under the new National  Development Plan 2007-2013. €581.3m of this will be provided this year alone.In a new school building or refurbishment/extension PE facilities are included as an intrinsic part of the design.At primary level, Physical Education is one of the seven curriculum areas and is an intrinsic element of the Primary School Curriculum. A revised curriculum in physical education at primary level was introduced in September 2005 supported by a national programme of professional development for teachers. The programme provides for six strands of activity — athletics, dance, gymnastics,  games, outdoor and adventure activities and aquatics. All qualified Primary teachers are qualified to teach the full spectrum of the Primary Curriculum including Physical Education.The PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the PE programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.Primary schools received €2000 each in PE equipment grants in 2006, at a total cost of €6.5 million. In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase  resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.The extent and quality of local sports facilities has been improved dramatically in recent years, with more than €450 million invested by the Government since 1998 in over 5,000 projects through the Sports Capital Programme. At the same time, PE, general purpose and outdoor play facilities have been provided for schools all over the country through the School Building Programme.So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, the Government is working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed, the ‘State of the Nation's Children' report published by the Minister for Children, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1392	In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second-level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable. The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.A revised syllabus in Physical Education as a non examinable subject at Junior  Cycle was introduced in post-primary schools in September 2003 and implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2005. No implementation dates have been set as yet for further reforms in this area.This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities. In a  new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as  part of the design, and new PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.A special PE funding package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools in  2007, providing a grant of €4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and  upgrading PE equipment. This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc. So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed, the second ‘State of the Nation's Children' report launched recently by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs found that children in Ireland are  doing well on physical activity, ranking first across the 41 participating countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.

In all, there are 13 primary schools on the offshore  islands with a total enrolment of around 270 pupils. There are 4 post-primary  schools and one unit attached to a mainland school on the offshore islands,  with an enrolment of almost 170 pupils.Where it is not feasible to provide a post primary school on an island, island families are eligible for financial assistance under the Remote Area Boarding Grant Scheme to facilitate a child's attendance at school on the mainland.Under the Scheme, grants are paid towards the cost of boarding in or near  second level boarding schools in the Free Education Scheme for pupils whose  homes are outside the range of public transport services to a day school  providing suitable post primary education.I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that all persons living  on our offshore islands have access to quality education.

The purpose  and function of funding support in this context is to develop both the teaching  and research capability and capacity in the Higher Education System. My  Department also provides annual funding to the Dublin Institute for Advanced  Studies to support its activities.Specifically in relation to research, the Irish Research Council for the  Humanities and Social Sciences, which is funded by my Department, funds  cutting-edge research in the humanities, social sciences, business and law with  the objective of creating new knowledge and expertise beneficial to Ireland's  economic, social and cultural development. The Research Council operates a  suite of interlinked Research Schemes, including pre and post-doctoral levels  and research projects grants. A number of projects in the areas of old,  classical and middle Irish are supported by the Research Council.A national Foresight exercise to explore the contribution that the arts,  humanities and social sciences make to the Irish economy and society is being  undertaken by the Higher Education Authority and the Research Council. The  overall objective of the Foresight exercise is to provide a comprehensive  review of the contribution which a thriving humanities and social sciences  sector can make to social and economic development; to review the current  status, strengths and weaknesses of the arts, humanities and social sciences in  Ireland and to chart a course for their future so that they can make the best  possible contribution to social and economic development.The exercise will make an objective assessment of the role of the arts,  humanities and social sciences in interacting with current research and policy;  map past and present research; identify strategic opportunities and the  supports necessary for the development of the arts, humanities and social  sciences research in Ireland.It is expected that this Foresight exercise will be completed later this year.

The arrangement, is that a  replacement teacher is employed (in a temporary or Regular Part-Time capacity)  in his/her school for the duration of the absence.The member of the Oireachtas retains his/her full salary and allowances and the  cost of the replacement including employers superannuation and PRSI is deducted from this salary.  The balance of salary remaining after the cost of the  replacement teacher, the statutory and other voluntary deductions payable by the Oireachtas member are deducted is paid to him/her.  A number of members do  not accept any outstanding balance of salary.Under the current arrangement the member of the Oireachtas also retains the  right to go back to his/her teaching post.  The period of teaching service  whilst the person is a member of the Oireachtas is reckonable for incremental  credit and is pensionable.I will consider the matter raised by the Deputy and the proposal to limit the  period of the approved leave of absence from teaching duty in the light of the  outcome of discussions in relation to redeployment arrangements.

To date, the Patron has not been able to do this and the school is  currently located on a temporary basis in premises outside the Clontarf/Marino/Fairview area. It continues to be my Department's intention to  re-locate this school to that area if and when suitable accommodation becomes  available and as the funding situation allows.If there is a need for further multi-denominational school places in the  Glasnevin area, my Department will explore how these can be provided in the  context of the pre-existing schools, which is in accordance with normal  procedures in these matters.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1404	Teacher numbers at primary level have increased significantly in recent years and by almost 2,400 since June 2007 levels when this Government took office.I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. This obviously impacted on the ability to follow through on commitments in the Programme for Government. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.In relation to staffing, when the country was able to afford it we reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of primary pupils per teacher from 35 pupils in 1995/96 down to the current level of 27 pupils. This is reflected in the improvements that we have made on class sizes over the years and these improvements reflect our commitment to education. The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher from September 2009 has to be viewed in that context. Although it reverses some of the progress that we have made in recent years I had no option but to curtail the annual increase in teacher numbers. The reduced class sizes for the most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools of an average of 1 teacher for every 20 pupils in Junior classes and an average of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils in Senior classes are not affected by the Budget decision.While the budget measures will impact on class sizes it will be necessary in the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone. While teacher numbers are important numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor — far and above anything else — in improving educational outcomes for children. Ensuring high quality teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it represent a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and indeed the teacher unions.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence shortly. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1406	The Deputy may be aware that the Teaching Council has a statutory role in relation to the review of standards required for entry into the teaching profession, including the standards of knowledge, skill and competence required for the practice of teaching. The Council has begun its work in relation to this review and will produce a Strategy for the Review and Accreditation of Programmes of Initial Teacher Education. To this end, the Council held a series of consultation fora for stakeholders in education in February and October last year, and the Council will continue to consult with education partners, including my Department, over the course of their work. I look forward to receiving the Council's Strategy in due course.Regarding the reservation of places for students from disadvantaged areas, the Colleges of Education operate direct entry schemes for such applicants. The intake of students via this stream of entry to initial teacher education programmes has admittedly been low, this is due to a number of factors including low numbers of applicants and the fact that some students from disadvantaged areas apply successfully for teacher education programmes via the ‘normal' route. My Department will continue to monitor the intake of students from disadvantaged areas in the Colleges of Education and will liaise with the Colleges as necessary.My Department continues to prioritise high quality in-career professional development for teachers and principals. There are a range of national programmes in place to support teachers' professional and personal development covering such diverse areas as curricular or syllabus change, support for teaching and learning methodology, improving teachers' competence in the teaching of the Irish language as a communicative tool, child protection, student behavioural issues, development of leadership skills in schools, whole school planning, addressing the teaching of children with special educational needs and so on. In addition, the national network of education centres provides a range of local and summer courses for teachers, which respond to identified needs and advance the quality of teaching and learning generally.In 2008, my department spent almost €36m on in-career professional development for teachers and principals at primary and post-primary level.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1407	This Government's continued prioritisation of education is evidenced from our investment in 2009 of €9.6 billion — over treble what it was in 1997.The increase of €302m in the Education budget for 2009 is therefore a real achievement in the current economic climate. Education is one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding in 2009. The budget for education is showing an increase of just over 3% overall, while the 2.6% increase in current expenditure sets the growth in expenditure for education in 2009 second only to Social Welfare. The commitment in relation to doubling the capitation grant to primary schools can only be looked at and considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position.I am aware of the funding pressures on schools and I fully recognise the contribution of parents fund-raising to support their local school. In relation to day to day funding for schools I have prioritised funding for primary schools.The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of day to day funding for primary schools which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.  This builds on the progress has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €200. This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.The primary capitation grant has been improved by more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil and the ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by €3.50 to €155 per pupil.  Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get €355 per pupil — or almost €25 extra — in this school year to cover their day to day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting €7,475 more. In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than €40,000 to meet its day to day running costs. That same school under these new rates will receive €106,500. This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants which are paid by my Department.Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €512 to €986 per pupil — an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.By any standards there have been very significant improvements within a relatively short period of time and the Government is committed to further increasing funding for schools as resources permit. While increasing resources is important, we must also focus on measures to enhance the quality of education in our schools to ensure that increased resources lead to the best possible outcomes for our children.We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances. I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1408	The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.The funding arrangements made by my Department for post-primary schools reflect the sectorial division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.Despite the current budgetary constraints, I am pleased that the capitation grant has increased by 4.3%, representing an increase of €14 per pupil, to bring it to €345 per pupil from January 2009.  Voluntary secondary schools will also benefit also from an increase in the school services support grant by €8 per pupil from January 2009.  This increase is a specific equalisation measure. This will mean, for example, that a secondary school with an enrolment of 500 pupils will receive an additional €11,000 in per capita funding in 2009.Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector, along with those in the VEC sector, are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant.  All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.These significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.My Department is considering how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level, as envisaged in the programme for Government 2007-2012, having regard to available resources.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1409	I am very much aware of the cost pressures on schools, including those arising from waste charges and the changes in relation to water charges.With regard to waste charges, there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to examine the feasibility of introducing waste allowances for schools.  The progression of this commitment is primarily a matter for my colleague — the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My predecessor was in contact with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on this issue, and my Department will of course input to and support as required any work being done by that Department on the commitment.The Government agreed a transition period to full water charges in the case of non-fee charging recognised schools.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed arrangements regarding the implementation of this decision.The transitional arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place water conservation arrangements and practices and to undertake works that can help reduce water usage significantly before full water charges are introduced.  By virtue of good water conservation, schools can be in a much stronger position to reduce the impact of water charges on their overall budgets.Under the transition arrangements agreed by the Government, schools pay a flat rate per pupil fee as follows: 2007- €3 per pupil, 2008 — €3.50 per pupil and 2009- €4 per pupil enrolled.  For 2007, charges applied based on metering were recalculated on the transitional flat rate with a credit given for any excess payment.Guidance was also issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists.  In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.  Furthermore, those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.In the context of reducing water costs for schools, it has been demonstrated that fitting simple water saving devices to toilets and sinks can reduce water consumption considerably at very little cost, as can other small works such as fixing easily identifiable leaks.Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to fund such measures.  The minor works grant has increased by nearly 50% over the past two years; some €27m is due to issue to all primary schools in early 2009 under this grant scheme.My Department remains in close liaison with the Department of Environment and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any initiatives by it and local authorities that will help reduce water costs for schools.In relation to day to day funding for schools, I prioritised funding for primary schools in the recent budget, increasing the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level to €200 per pupil.  The increases in the enhanced rates for special needs pupils in special classes and special schools brings the top rate up to almost €1,000 per pupil. The capitation grant for post-primary schools has been increased by 4.3%, representing an increase of €14 per pupil, to bring it to €345 per pupil from January 2009.  Voluntary secondary schools will also benefit also from an increase in the school services support grant by €8 per pupil from January 2009.  This will mean, for example, that a secondary school with an enrolment of 500 pupils will receive an additional €11,000 in funding in 2009.While I clearly will want to improve funding as soon as circumstances permit, I am anxious to make the capitation grant mechanism the single funding channel for schools.

This Unit was established early in 2008.This fast-track approach to the provision of school buildings delivered 26 major building projects in 2008 providing accommodation for about 7,000 students and ensured there was no shortage of pupil places. Twenty of these buildings consist of eight-classroom units and the remainder are 16-classroom units. They are located in areas which have experienced rapid population growth over the past number of years.Vital to the successful delivery of the programme in 2008 was the co-operation of the relevant local authorities who worked closely with my Department on the acquisition of sites and on general preplanning issues.  The Forward Planning Section of my Department is identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards.Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.

This sets out a series of agreed actions between my Department and the planning authorities such as:Forecasting Future Education Demand;Planning for New Schools through Local Authority Development Plans;Location of Schools;Site Development Standards;School Development Proposals and the Development Management Process; andSchool Site Identification and Acquisition.The Code of Practice, which was agreed between the respective Departments, in conjunction with the City and County Managers' Association, was issued as statutory guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1412	The Professional and Technical staff in my Department regularly reviews and updates the design of school buildings. A suite of technical guidance documents is available on my Department's website to assist design teams in best practice in the design and development of projects and to encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception.My Department has developed Generic Repeat Designs to reduce the cost, speed up the delivery of new schools, particularly in developing areas, and to ensure that the most up to date technologies are used. Further design templates are being developed, using appropriate off site construction technologies, for repeatable buildings.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1413	My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to energy efficiency in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both national and international level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.The Department's Technical Guidance Documents which set the benchmark for low energy design in schools are clearly focused on energy efficiency and are based on solid energy research projects.It has been demonstrated that all Primary Schools designed and built in line with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than international best practice and nearly five times more efficient than schools built in the late 1980s.My Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme with over thirty research projects at various stages currently in hand.  A hybrid approach is taken with respect to low energy design in schools based on maximising natural resources and energy efficient technologies. Schools are positioned to maximise gain from the sun during the day for passive solar heating and natural daylight. Passive solar design saves 20% of the early morning heating period and adequate natural daylight when combined with automated lighting systems in the classrooms can eliminate the need for electrical light for up to 80% of the schools teaching hours.Energy efficient boilers and individual room temperature controls combined with a strong emphasis on air tight testing and high insulation levels minimise heat requirements. Water usage is minimised through automatic shut off taps and dual flush toilets, while local water blending valves are provided to prevent scalding and rain water recovery is provided.My Department is currently conducting a demonstration and research project to evaluate the suitable application and performance and compatibility of biomass systems with school heating requirements in terms of heating demand characteristics, controls, reliability, fuel storage and maintenance and operation.This project comprises the design, installation and monitoring of Biomass heating systems in Primary and Post Primary Schools. Fifteen boiler systems are presently installed.  The project also includes the development of a good practice guide for the design and installation of biomass heating systems in schools specifically aimed at school design teams and managers and will lead to the development of a suite of case studies on the selected projects.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1414	The primary responsibility of my Department in this area is the provision of school facilities for the effective delivery of the curriculum. In addition, school authorities have a considerable degree of autonomy in relation to how their premises are managed and utilised at local level.However, the Government recognises that there is a lack of recreational facilities for community use in certain areas which could be met if school premises were made available to the wider community. To encourage schools in this respect, my Department issued a circular to all school authorities in late 2005 urging trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available, where possible, for community education and recreation purposes. Decisions in relation to the use of school facilities remain entirely at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending the school are prioritised in the first instance. It is also important that schools should ensure that insurance and security are covered as it is unlikely that the school's insurance policy would cover non-school activities or that a caretaker would be routinely available to open/lock up premises.My Department has also progressed a number of school building projects within the Fingal and Adamstown areas of Dublin with local authorities/developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing.  In respect of PPP schools, the contract arrangements provide for school facilities to be available for community use when not required by the school.My Department's position generally is that the availability of such facilities should be self-funding i.e. adequate to cover the heat/light/caretaking arrangements as well as making some contribution to the repair of wear and tear on premises caused by increased use.

This matter is currently under consideration in my Department.

Around €27m was paid out that year and a similar amount for the 2007/8 and 2008/9 school years to primary schools throughout the country to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department. Individual primary schools received a grant in the sum of €5,500 plus €18.50 per pupil.The level of grant to be paid under the grant scheme for the 2009/2010 school year will be considered in the context of available funding.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1417	As the Deputy is aware, the programme for Government commits my Department to ensuring that where the State builds a new school on land which it owns, the building will be in the ownership of the Department of Education.Those sites that are acquired by my Department for the purposes of providing permanent accommodation for schools are generally green-field sites and the school buildings provided thereon remain in the ownership of the Minister or the relevant VEC. In the case of PPP projects the Minister for Education and Science also retains ownership of both the site and school building.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1418	I am conscious of the workload issues affecting Principal teachers and am aware of the key role they play in determining the shape of our schools.  The scheme of release time for principals enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative leadership and management functions. The number of days release time allowed varies between 14 and 22 and is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school. Paid substitution is provided by my Department for the days that Principals are on release time.In the 2005/2006 school year my Department, following consultation with the relevant education interests, introduced on a pilot basis, a system whereby a fully qualified primary school teacher may be employed to act as a nominated substitute teacher for the Principals in a cluster of schools taking release days. Twenty clusters have been established under the pilot scheme.There is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the number of release days for teaching principals and to also expand the pilot scheme for substitute cover for principal release days.  However, there is no scope for making improvements in this area in the current economic and budgetary environment.  I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect, Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.

This investment has now led us to a point where there are structured professional development opportunities for all school leaders in our system from their point of appointment to day of retirement.In 2008 LDS, in conjunction with NUI Maynooth, introduced Toraíocht, a formal training programme for aspiring school leaders. The Toraíocht Programme was designed in conjunction with the Department of Education at Maynooth and the wider educational partners and responds to the need for professional development that prepares school leaders of the future. 160 places were available on the programme and in total 240 applicants sought a place. This programme leads to an award of a Post-Graduate Diploma from NUI, Maynooth.LDS continues to offer provision for all new principal teachers, all new deputy principals, a programme for established leaders, a programme for aspiring leaders and some tailored professional development for leaders in designated DEIS schools and leaders in Special Schools.

The Parties to the forum include representatives of the managerial authorities of schools, the teacher unions and the Departments of Education & Science and Finance.  The purpose of these discussions is to ensure that maximum benefit is derived from the management structure in schools to assist school authorities in the running of schools.As the proceedings of the Conciliation Council are confidential it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1421	Consideration is being given to the timing and resource requirements of a Learner Database to be introduced initially at Primary level and then rolled out to Second-level. It is intended to proceed, as soon as resources permit, with a live on-line system allowing for easy exchange of information that reflects the up-to-date situation in regard to enrolment at any one time and to cut down on administrative burden and the scale of paper-based information flows across the Department and its associated agencies.  These developments will build on the existing On Line Claim System (O.L.C.S.) which already allows each primary school and Voluntary Secondary, Community and Comprehensive school through ESINET to record absences and submit claims to the Department for the payment of casual and non casual teachers and Special Needs Assistants.  The process of manual form filling at school level and manual data input at Department level has been reduced as a result of OLCS.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1422	Intensive training for boards of management took place in 2007 and 2008 including the new boards at primary level. The essential core areas that are covered in the training are Financial Management, Child Protection Guidelines, Health & Safety, Employment Law and Human Resource Management. Other areas that are covered in training include Background Information re: the Education System, Role and Function of the Board, How a BoM Operates, Policies and Procedures. All representative bodies form part of the Steering Committee for BoM training and these bodies also provide training in additional areas which they identify pertaining to their respective values.My Department has provided funding of €1,060,000 to date for this training which has proved extremely worthwhile and will remain committed to ensuring that the boards of management of schools will continue to receive appropriate training to tackle the issues that they will face in the ever changing needs of schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1423	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1403 and 1405 together.The Government is committed to promoting appropriate levels of exercise for our children and young people — both in their communities and at school.  In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as an intrinsic part of the design.A special PE funding package of €6.5 million issued in 2006 to primary schools, and in 2007 a similar package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools. In addition, since 2000, my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Such materials and equipment would normally have a useful life of several years.The extent and quality of local sports facilities has been improved dramatically in recent years, with more than €450 million invested by the Government since 1998 in over 5,000 projects through the Sports Capital Programme. At the same time, PE, general purpose and outdoor play facilities have been provided for schools all over the country through the School Building Programme.Expenditure on PE equipment and PE facilities in schools will arise for consideration in the context of the funding available for my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1424	In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second-level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable. The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.A revised syllabus in Physical Education as a non examinable subject at Junior Cycle was introduced in post-primary schools in September 2003 and implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2005. No implementation dates have been set as yet for further reforms in this area.This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities. In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design, and new PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.A special PE funding package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools in 2007, providing a grant of €4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment. This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active. Indeed, the second ‘State of the Nation's Children' report launched recently by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking first across the 41 participating countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.Question No. 1405 answered with Question No. 1403.

This allocation is based on the pupil enrolment in September of the preceding school year.As a result of the decision to allocate an additional 100 posts to guidance from September 2005 an enhanced guidance allocation provision has been put in place from the commencement of the 2005/06 school year. This enhanced provision means that in the case of schools in the Free Education Scheme, the level of allocation ranges from 8 hours per week for schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 47 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. The additional posts included provision for a further improvement in the allocation of Guidance hours for post-primary schools participating in the DEIS programme — Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools. The allocation for these schools now ranges from 11 hours per week for schools with enrolments below 300 to 55 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. There are currently a total of 708 whole time equivalent posts allocated for guidance in post primary schools.All programme for Government commitments to improve public services are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. The commitment in relation to increasing the number of guidance counsellors at second level can only be looked at and considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position that might prevail in the coming years and the competing priorities for available resources.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1426	I believe that schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads.The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others, can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.In February of 2007, the Road Safety Authority launched the RSA MACE "Safe to School" campaign at primary level. The programme is aimed at helping primary school children learn effective road safety lessons. The 2007 campaign covered walking to school safely, in 2008 the campaign is focused around the topic of Cycling to School Safely. A dedicated website, www.safetoschool.ie, has also been launched as part of the campaign.The Streetwise programme for junior cycle pupils was launched in UN Road Safety Week on 24 April 2007. It covers road safety across 9 topics — walking, cycling, seatbelts, airbags, speed, driver fatigue, motor cycle safety, hazard recognition and the engineering aspects of road safety — to be delivered over nine class periods.In addition, a Road Safety programme for Transition Year, developed by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Second level Support Service was piloted in the 2007/08 school year. It was offered on a mainstream basis from September 2008, and over 200 schools applied participated in-service training in order to provide the programme.My Department will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen the role of schools in promoting road safety even further.  A range of measures are also being taken to promote safety on school buses.

Results of a survey on the uptake of Stay Safe carried out by CAPP and my Department in 2006 showed that at that time: 2,514 schools (84.19%) were providing the programme 472 (15.81%) were not providing the programme, and 263 schools (8.8%) of respondents) were not teaching the sections on inappropriate sexual contact and secrecy.Of the 472 schools that were not teaching stay safe, 240 (8.0% of respondents) reported that child abuse prevention was covered as part of the curriculum.  Following this survey my Department has been taking a targeted approach to the provision of training.Two additional primary school teachers were seconded to CAPP in September 2007 to assist with this training which is being directed at those schools that had indicated they are not implementing the programme.The following table illustrates the most up to date position in relation to the provision of training by CAPP for teachers in the 635 schools that were either not providing the programme, or not teaching particular sections of it:Total in Target Group — 635;Training Delivered / Organised — 390;Ongoing — 202;Declined — 43.In addition to this targeted training, CAPP continues to provide in-service training and support to all primary schools on request.  In the 2007/2008 school year CAPP has provided training to approximately 615 schools, over 5,000 teachers and 1,100 special needs assistants.  Since the survey results from 31/10/06 the totals for CAPP staff training organised are:Schools in Target Group: 390;Other Schools (by request): 667;Total Schools: 1,057.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1428	Section 27 of the Education Act, 1998 provides that Boards of Management in second level schools shall facilitate and give all reasonable assistance to Student Councils. Student Councils are established in the majority of post-primary schools. It is important not only to ensure that each school has a Student Council which is representative of all students in the school but also that Councils are given a meaningful role in school decision-making.The Act provides that Boards shall have procedures for the purposes of informing students of the activities of the school and to facilitate the involvement of students in the operation of the school, having regard to the age and experience of the students, in association with their parents and teachers.An active Student Council can be a most effective way to involve students in the affairs of the school, in cooperation with the board, parents and teachers.  In 2002, my Department issued guidelines on the establishment and operation of Student Councils, ‘Student Councils: A Voice for Students'. In November 2005, a curriculum development project on the setting up and development of Student Councils, entitled Giving Young People a Voice, through the Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE) curriculum was established. This was a partnership project between the Office for the Minister for Children and the Curriculum Development Unit of City of Dublin VEC. The Project has assisted and supported schools, teachers and students in the establishment of effective Student Councils in schools through the development and piloting of a teaching and learning resource for the CSPE curriculum. It is important that schools engage with the issues which Student Councils themselves highlight as matters of concern.In post-primary schools where Student Councils have been established, my Department's Inspectorate meets with the representatives of the students during a whole-school evaluation. This meeting is intended to provide the students' representatives with opportunities to give an account of their participation in school life, their achievements during the year, how they manage meetings, who they communicate with and how and to talk about some of the issues that have been raised at meetings. Students' views are also sought on the atmosphere of the school and the extent to which students are involved in decision-making.  Whole School Evaluation Reports continue to focus on Student Councils in a meaningful way.In September 2007, my Department appointed a Student Council Coordinator to design and deliver a programme of professional development to respond to identified needs and to support Student Council Liaison teachers and schools involved in establishing and developing effective Student Councils at second-level. The Student Council Co-ordinator works within the CSPE Support Service with specific responsibility for Student Councils. The Student Council Coordinator has engaged with the Inspectorate to advise them on good practices for the operation of Student Councils.The second level support service of my Department is providing training at national, regional, local and school level for both the liaison teachers and the Student Councils. The purpose of this training is to develop effective student councils. Support is also being provided to encourage the networking of Student Councils.In relation specifically to Boards of Management, the advice being delivered at in-service and in schools is that Student Councils should be proactive in engaging with the Boards of Management of their schools.  They should present their reviewed Constitution to the Board of Management for ratification every year, soon after the elections.The students are being encouraged keep the Board updated on meetings and issues by sending agendas and minutes to the Board through the Secretary which is usually the Principal of a school.Reports should be sent regularly to the Board and the Student Council should look to meet with the Board a minimum of twice a year, at the beginning and at the end.  Funding applications for needs identified in the school or for the day to day running of the Student Council should also be made directly to the Board.Student Councils are being encouraged to evaluate the year's work. This would include asking the Board, school staff, students and the parents' associations, to evaluate their engagement with the Council during the year.Resources are currently being developed to support the Liaison Teachers in their work with the Student Councils one of which will specifically address the practical needs of the Student Council in e.g. how to present and draw up plans, proposals, funding applications, the constitution, reports etc. to the Boards of Management. This resource will be presented to Liaison Teachers at national in-service for consultation and review, prior to dissemination to schools.In May 2008 the National Educational Welfare Board published the document Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools. The overall responsibility for ensuring that a code of behaviour is prepared in school rests with the Board of Management. The Guidelines highlight, as a matter of good practice, the importance of including students in consultations. As student councils can play an important role in planning and managing the consultation process with students, who consequently are more likely to support a code of behaviour when they have helped to develop it.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1429	The NCCA proposals for reform envisaged re-structuring of senior cycle programmes into subjects, short courses and Transition Units, a strengthening of practical project and portfolio assessment, a spread of assessment events with subjects having two assessment components, and embedding of key skills into subjects.In response, the then Minister Mary Hanafin. T.D. welcomed the embedding of core skills, the inclusion of a second assessment component, and the moves to standardise transition units. She asked that change be implemented on a phased basis over a significant period of time, minimising disruption, taking account of logistical and cost factors and system capacity to change. The Minister asked the NCCA to prioritise the reconfiguration of subjects generally within the Leaving Certificate in order to embed key skills, and to provide for a second assessment component. She indicated her concern the TYP should remain as a single year programme for equity reasons. On short courses, she asked the NCCA to develop as an exemplar a short course in Enterprise Education, building on the existing Links Modules, so that the Department could better assess the implementation issues.The NCCA has established a network to undertake development work with schools. A standardised framework for Transition Unit descriptors has been developed, and organisations are using these as new programme options for TYP are being developed. Reforms are under way in Irish to strengthen oral competence and to increase the proportion of marks for the oral examinations to 40% for all new entrants to second level from 2007/8.Reform in Mathematics Education at junior and senior cycle is also beginning on a phased basis. This started in 24 project schools with effect from 2008/9, and will begin in mainstream schools from September 2010. The reforms are designed to provide a bridging framework from the revised primary curriculum into second level, promote greater maths literacy across the school population, bring changed emphasis in the mathematics learnt and, in particular, a strong focus on context and applications and problem solving and a greater ICT dimension, encourage greater take up at higher level, and provide a solid foundation which prepares students for careers in science, technology, engineering, business or humanities options. For schools involved in the initial implementation from September 2008, students will experience mathematics in a new way. Teachers will be provided with classroom materials to enable them to adopt the new approaches and will be supported professionally in embracing change. These materials and supports will include lesson plans, with teacher guides and student worksheets, on-line exemplars and a range of assessment materials.Examination questions will also be changed for these students.  Recommendations are expected shortly from the NCCA in regard to senior cycle science subjects. The Council has submitted short courses in Enterprise and Psychology for consideration by the Department, and the implementation issues are being examined at present.  Work is also at an advanced stage in regard to proposals for the subjects Social Personal and Health Education and Politics and Society in senior cycle.

The Council proposed that school based assessment would be inbuilt into each transition unit, and models for the validation of schools to develop their own Transition Units would be explored. The units would cover such areas of learning as creative applications, skills, personal achievement, sampling of subjects, enterprise, civic and social education, and work and future.In response, the then Minister Mary Hanafin TD welcomed the measures to standardise transition units, and indicated her concern that the Transition Year Programme should remain as a single year programme for equity reasons.  The NCCA has established a network to undertake development work with schools. A standardised framework for Transition Unit descriptors has been developed, and organisations are using these as new programme options for TYP are being developed. The decriptors are designed to promote better planning and communication and provide for greater clarity and coherence in the implementation of the programme. They require schools to set out the aims of the unit, its learning outcomes, how key skills are being integrated, what methodology and assessment approaches will be taken and how it will be evaluated.New Transition Units have been developed and posted to the NCCA website in a range of areas and a guide has been produced to help schools to develop their own units in keeping with the descriptor format. Schools may forward their Transition Units to the NCCA for further feedback and support. Guidelines have also been developed for agencies and non governmental organisations wishing to develop a Transition Unit, and a range of Transition Units are currently being developed by these bodies.

Provision of science facilities is an intrinsic part of all major projects at post-primary level.Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Schemes 2004 -2007 to refurbish science laboratories.  Over 60 schools were approved for funding in 2006 and 2007 under my Department's Summer Works Scheme to enable them to get science laboratories refurbished on a devolved basis.Additionally, the Government has funded the provision of class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences. My Department also spent in excess of €13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of €3500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum.Expenditure on science laboratories and science equipment in schools will arise for consideration in the context of the funding available for my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1432	The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in collaboration with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment, has produced draft guidelines for teachers of exceptionally able students. These guidelines issued to all Primary and Post Primary schools in November 2007 along with a questionnaire for feedback.  The NCCA has sought feedback on the draft guidelines from teachers, school management and other interested individuals and organisations.These draft guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning. They feature ways in which teaching and learning can be effectively differentiated for such students, in particular how learning skills can be embedded in increasingly complex content. Case studies included in the guidelines present rich real-life contexts which consider the issues around exceptionality through the eyes of teachers, parents and students.The Special Education Support Service also provides support for school personnel working with talented / gifted students.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1433	There are currently 225 schools/centres offering the Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP), and the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) is currently offered in some 380 schools/centres and taken by around 6% of students each year.The DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Action Plan for Educational Inclusion provides for extended access to the JCSP for second-level schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. An additional 30 schools joined the programme in 2007, and a further 24 schools joined in 2008.   Participation in the programme is supported by an enhanced pupil:teacher ratio and by the provision of professional development support to schools and teachers.Participation in the Leaving Certificate Applied programme is also supported by an enhanced pupil:teacher ratio and by the provision of professional development support to schools and teachers.  In framing the budget for this year, a range of very difficult policy choices  had to be faced by the Government across all areas of public expenditure, including in the field of education. While education remains a priority for the Government, it has been necessary to curtail expenditure in some areas. Among the areas affected are the Junior Certificate School Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied where the special grant has been ceased.However, I would like to emphasise that the capitation grant for post-primary schools has been increased by 4.3%, representing an increase of €14 per student, to bring it to €345 per student from January 2009.  In addition, voluntary secondary schools will benefit also from an increase in the school services support grant by €8 per student from January 2009. This will mean, for example, that a secondary school with an enrolment of 500 students will receive an additional €11,000 in funding in 2009.  I am confident that the Junior Certificate School Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied will continue to be viable options for students.

Children's command of Irish is improved through participation in a range of activities, including music, arts and crafts and games, conducted through the medium of Irish. The programmes are developed by teachers working to guidelines produced by the Department of Education and Science.A grant of €5,420 is paid to each participating school to cover the project costs. In 2008, funding of €150,000 was provided to cover the costs of training the teachers and project costs for participating schools and consideration is being given to running the courses again in 2009.The Gaeltacht Scholarship scheme is designed to enable children enrolled in designated disadvantaged post-primary schools to attend approved summer colleges for teaching Irish.  Funding of €100,000 was made available, and approximately 150 students attended colleges for the scheme for 2008.

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. The Framework sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. It is being supported by the NCCA's Action website which provides exemplars of teaching and learning in different settings and shows the classroom application of learning outcomes and demonstrations in the ICT framework. The overall implementation of the ICT in Schools Programme is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education, which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.The European Computer Driving Licence is a widely used private sector qualification providing basic competences in a range of functions such as wordprocessing, spreadsheet, database, presentation, web browsing and e-mail.  There are also other qualifications attesting to similar or higher levels of skill, some of which are included in the national framework of qualifications.  The 2005 census of post-primary schools undertaken by the National Centre for Technology in Education indicates that 74% of post primary schools offered external certification in ICT, primarily using ECDL. Other awards in ICT offered included FETAC, City and Guilds, Royal Society of Arts, Microsoft, etc.  The Evaluation Report, ICT in Schools, undertaken by my Department's Inspectorate found that some 70% of post-primary schools surveyed provided ECDL courses for their students, while 28% provided FETAC Courses.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1437	DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). As a result of the identification and review processes, 876 schools have been included in the  School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS. These comprise 673 primary schools (urban and rural) and 203 second-level schools.  The plan is being rolled out on a phased basis over the period 2005 to 2010.  The following progress has been made in relation to the roll out of the action plan.In respect of the 2008/09 school year, grants amounting to approximately €10.5 million issued to the 673 Primary schools which are participating in the DEIS Initiative. Almost €4.4 million was paid in the course of the year in respect of the 203 Post Primary schools participating in the initiative and 74 Post Primary Schools receiving grants under pre-existing schemes. Also approximately another 1,900 primary schools received almost €3.3 million of grant assistance to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage.  2006 saw the implementation of targeted class size reductions of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes in urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.The roll-out has seen the extension of literacy and numeracy programmes, including Reading Recovery and ready set go, maths for schools in the urban primary strand of DEIS and the commencement of the family literacy project.Access to the Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) has been extended with 23 DEIS schools joining the programme in 2008/2009.  The JCSP is now available in 163 DEIS schools. 138 DEIS schools are currently providing the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) programme, 5 of these schools joined in 2008/2009. There are currently 25 DEIS schools in the Demonstration Library Project, with 10 schools being included in the project in 2008/2009.Templates for three year action plans to support school planning were introduced into schools in the primary strand of DEIS during autumn 2007. Planning templates have been introduced in DEIS post primary schools in the current school year. My Department has commenced an evaluation of measures under DEIS that will continue over the period to 2010.Under DEIS, Home/School/Community liaison and School Completion Programme services have been extended to any of the urban/town primary schools and second-level schools not already benefiting from them. Access to teacher/co-ordinator support for any of the rural primary schools, not already in receipt of such support under a previous measure has also been implemented.An additional 80 posts were provided under DEIS for the expansion of HSCL and in the region of €30 million has been allocated to HSCL for 2009. 184,000 pupils attending 651 schools (281 post primary & 370 primary) have access to Home School Community Liaison, with approx. 50,000 of these pupil's families being specifically targeted for the services of 450 local Home School Community Liaison Coordinators. A further €6 million has been allocated to the rural co-ordinator service for 2009.€31.3 million has been allocated to the School Completion Programme. 124 projects, targeting over 36,000 young people, are now participating in the School Completion Programme and spanning 26 counties.  The 124 projects includes 81 projects originally selected to participate in SCP in 2002 and 43 new SCP clusters created in 2006/07 including the new DEIS schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1438	My Department issued Circular 0138/2006 in December 2006 to primary schools requesting that they ensure that standardised testing is implemented on an annual basis for all pupils in English reading and Mathematics at the end of first class or the beginning of second class, and at the end of fourth class or the beginning of fifth class, beginning in the calendar year 2007.The introduction of the measure was supported by a national programme of teacher professional development in assessment for learning. Grants of €1.65m, €1.7m and €1.76m issued to schools in December 2006, December 2007 and December 2008 for the cost of test materials, teachers' manuals, test scoring services or test-related software. It is intended that the implementation of standardised testing at school level will be complemented by a separate programme of national monitoring so that national trends in different categories of school can be tracked over time. Schools in the DEIS programme have already been sampled by the Educational Research Centre for this purpose, and the sample of non-DEIS English and Irish medium schools is planned for 2009. The development work  for this was completed in 2008 Guidelines on assessment developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were published in October 2007 and issued to all teachers to assist schools in developing and implementing a policy on assessment practice in classrooms and on reporting to parents. In addition, a national programme of professional development for teachers on assessment for learning was provided.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1439	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1420 and 1421 together.The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the NEWB as the National body with responsibility for school attendance. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  The service has been developed incrementally, and, in April 2007, sanction was given to the Board for 15 additional staff bringing the total authorised staffing posts to 109 of which 104 are currently filled.In 2008 the financial allocation to the Board was €10.085 million. The 2009 allocation is being finalised and will be announced shortly. The funding allocation to the Board has increased incrementally as the service developed and the level of funding in 2008 represented an increase in funding of over 57% to the Board since 2003.The scale of the economic situation currently being experienced in this country will impact on my Department and it will be necessary to prioritise service provision in the education sector and this will involve tough decisions and choices on funding allocations which may include commitments as they relate to the Board.I would like to add that the NEWB is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators (HSCL) through their work with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school. School attendance is a central objective of the School Completion Programme (SCP) with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies. Access to these services is available to all schools participating in DEIS. In line with Department policy on closer integration of support services the NEWB is working with these programmes to improve the delivery of service to address school attendance.This approach aims to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.  I can also inform the Deputy that there are currently 155 psychologists employed in my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and a further psychologist is due to take up duty shortly.Additionally I was pleased to announce recently, in the context of Budget 2009, an increase in the funding available to NEPS with which it is envisaged that up to 50 further psychologists can be appointed which will bring the complement to a level in excess of that committed to under the programme for Government.Recruitment of these psychologists will begin shortly from the existing panel of qualified personnel, until its depletion, and discussions commence between my Department and the Public Appointments Service in relation to the establishment of a new panel in this regard.

Specifically, the following sections have been commenced — 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.In addition the Special Education Appeals Board (SEAB) was established in April 2007, under Section 36 of the EPSEN Act 2004, to hear and determine appeals pursuant to a number of sections of the Act.  The Board is continuing to identify the processes to be put in place in advance of commencement of the final sections of the Act.The sections of the EPSEN Act that have been deferred are those mainly concerned with the assessment of need process, the preparation and review of individual education plans and the associated appeals provisions in relation to these areas. A small number of sections refer to interaction between the NCSE and the health services. The full list of deferred sections is — 3 to 13, 14(1)(b), 14(1)(d), 14(1)(e), 14(1)(f), 15 to 18, 38 and 39.As has been outlined previously, it is not possible to commence the EPSEN Act incrementally by age cohort, therefore the provisions of the Act especially regarding assessments and individual education plans will have to be commenced for all children at the same time. This means that the necessary training arrangements, personnel and systems have to be in place at the time of commencement.As required under the Act, the NCSE provided a report making recommendations regarding the implementation of EPSEN which suggested additional investment over a period of years of up to €235m per annum across the education and health sectors. Having considered the NCSE report, and consulted with the education partners, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE, my Department identified a range of options for the implementation of EPSEN. It is not possible to give exact figures regarding cost as the specific amount of money required to support implementation would depend on the options chosen and the timeframe for the implementation of these options. However, my Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is therefore not possible to proceed with implementation in 2010 as originally envisaged.  However, the Government will keep the matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. I intend to build on the progress that has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase in resources for special needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents and children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs.Furthermore, as announced on Budget day, an additional €20m has been provided — €10m for education services and €10m for health services — to strengthen and enhance services and continue the preparation for the full implementation of the Act at a later date.The additional funding being allocated to my Department will provide for an expansion of the National Educational Psychological service so that all schools in the country will be covered by the service. The additional funding available to NEPS, which represents a 33% increase over the 2008 allocation, will facilitate the recruitment of up to 50 further psychologists. It is envisaged that this will bring the number of NEPS psychologists by the end of 2009 above the proposed 200 incorporated in the programme for Government.This investment will significantly enhance the capacity of our educational psychologists to directly support schools in the development and delivery of appropriate interventions for children with special educational needs.  Additional funding is also being provided to the National Council for Special Education in 2009 to increase the Council's capacity in the move towards the full implementation of EPSEN. The additional funding will enable the Council to continue to improve, plan and co-ordinate the delivery of services for children with special needs.I have also provided for further investment in teacher training in this area.  This will ensure that teachers are provided with opportunities to access continuing professional development so that the learning and teaching needs of all pupils with Special Educational Needs continue to be met. The provision of high quality training ensures that pupils learning opportunities are enriched and learning outcomes are optimised.An integrated approach is being adopted by the education and health sectors to target these additional resources to the areas of greatest need. Progress in both sectors will be kept under review by the Office for Disability & Mental Health and the Cross-Sectoral Team of the Departments of Education and Science, and Health and Children.during 2009.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1441	The Deputy will be aware that a key priority for the Government over the past decade has been to improve the provision of additional resources for all pupils, including those attending post-primary schools.My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them cater for pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Such supports include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant (SNA) support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers and SNAs in our second level schools who are specifically dedicated to supporting the education of pupils with SEN.All second level schools in the free education/block grant schemes have an entitlement to an ex-quota teacher allocation in respect of remedial/learning support teaching and guidance provision.My Department supports the education of individual students with SEN in second level schools, including those experiencing difficulty with literacy and numeracy, throughout the country. The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, the provision of special dedicated classes within the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios.The organisation of such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department.  Where a pupil with SEN enrols in a post primary school, the school may apply to the NCSE for additional teaching and/or SNA support. The number of hours allocated will vary depending on the nature of the special educational need.In addition, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with SEN. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally.The provision of SEN in second level schools should be informed and guided by the guideline document "Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs: Post-Primary Guidelines" produced by my Department which provides practical advice and guidance to schools on the organisation and co-ordination of resources to maximise the support to each individual student.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1442	I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. This obviously impacted on the ability to follow through on commitments in the Programme for Government. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.In relation to language support the budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.  However, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to get it. We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teaching posts in our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on a case by case basis.The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically. Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling.Moreover, OECD research in this field (PISA 2006) shows that Ireland is the OECD country with the highest distribution of newcomers across schools meaning that schools with higher concentrations of newcomer children are relatively unusual. ESRI data also shows that only a small percentage of schools have high concentrations of newcomer children.I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching resources and that the quality of the supports that the child receives and the inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing the quality of learning achieved by migrant children. My Department recognises that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided to migrant students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our provision. The Department is undertaking a range of research to consider the question of integration in schools and how best to deploy our resources to ensure that all the children in our schools can benefit from learning in an intercultural Ireland.

Funds are allocated to VECs who are the main statutory providers of ESOL tuition. Currently, there are approximately 100 VEC colleges, 10 Prison Education providers, 100 Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) colleges, 100 Youthreach centres and some community groups providing ESOL classes.  The number of ESOL participants has increased from almost 6,000 in 2003 to over 13,000 in 2008.An independent review was commissioned to assist in the development of a national English language training policy and framework for legally-resident adult immigrants based on extensive stakeholder consultation. The report in this regard is under consideration by the Minister for Integration.

Expenditure increased from €1,000,000 in 1997 to €30,000,000 in 2008. Since 2000, over 250,000 participants have availed of adult literacy tuition through the VEC sector.Due to the difficult budgetary position it has not been possible to provide for any further increase in places.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1446	The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) commenced in October 2002. It provides flexible, part-time options across Further Education and an opportunity to combine a return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities.  It is aimed at adults with less than upper second level education, including unemployed adults.The Programme for Government (2007-2012) provided for an increase in the number of places on the BTEI to 10,000.  1,000 additional places were allocated in 2007 and a further 500 places were allocated in 2008 bringing the total number of places to 9,500.For 2009, difficult choices around priorities for investment had to be made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this context, it was necessary to reduce the number of places on the BTEI by 500, returning it to the 2007 level of 9,000. This reduction should be seen in the context of the significant increase in expenditure on the BTEI in the last six years, up from €6,000,000 in 2002 to €18,750,000 in 2008.The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) was introduced in 1989 to encourage adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of unemployment payments to return to education and training. Over the following years, the Scheme was expanded to people in receipt of other payments, such as One-Parent Family allowances, Disability allowances and Invalidity Pension.VTOS is a full-time second chance education and training initiative delivered and managed locally by the VECs. Its primary target group is the longer-term unemployed, the low-skilled and disadvantaged. Courses of up to two years duration and between levels 3 and 6 on the National Qualifications Framework are offered. Tuition, stationery and books are provided free of charge.   A childcare grant and meal and travel allowances are also available to students and they can access the adult guidance service.There are 5,000 VTOS places available nationally every year.  Due to the difficult budgetary position it has not been possible to increase the numbers further.It should be noted that there has been a significant increase in expenditure on VTOS in the last five years, up from approximately €51,000,000 in 2003 to €71,000,000 in 2008.

The Social Inclusion Priority of the NDP also supports increased participation by disadvantaged groups through funding allocated through the higher education grant scheme and the third level access measure.  The combination of these measures, as well as the investment of other resources across the education system are achieving their intended objective. Targets for increased participation in higher education set by the Action Group on Access in 2001 have been achieved, both by disadvantaged and mature entrants to the sector. Evaluations of progress show that all of these measures have contributed to significantly increased participation rates in higher education.New targets have been set by the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2008-13.In 1998 the overall participation rate in higher education was 44%.  By 2004 it had risen to 55%.  The HEA estimate that in 2007 participation rose to 64% of the relevant age cohort.  A target of 65% has been set by the National Access Plan for 2013 and a target of 72% by 2020.In 1998 mature students represented 5% of entrants to higher education; in 2006 this had increased to 13%. A target of 20% by 2013 has been set by the National Access Plan 2008-13.In 1998 just 23% of young people aged 17-19 from a socio-economic disadvantaged background entered higher education.  By 2004 this had increased to 33%.  A new target of 45% participation by 2020 has been set by the National Access Plan 2008-13.

The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2008–2013, which I launched in July last year, seeks to encourage the broadening of entry routes to higher education institutions to greater reflect the fundamental changes being brought about through implementation of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).FETAC (Further Education and Training Awards Council) Level 5 and 6 qualifications are accepted as a basis for admission to the majority of higher education institutions and these qualifications are used as a route of access by increasing numbers of CAO applicants each year. The proportion of higher education places accepted by holders of FETAC major awards has grown from less than 3% in 2005 to over 10% in 2008 (4,309 students).The Higher Education Links Scheme (HELS), introduced in 1995, links specific FETAC Level 5 Certificates and Level 6 Advanced Certificates to reserved places on a variety of higher education programmes. More recently, under an additional Pilot Scheme, course places are open to both FETAC applicants and Leaving Certificate applicants. Both schemes are intended to facilitate greater progression to third level programmes.In October 2008 FETAC published a leaflet outlining current progression routes for holders of the FETAC Advanced Certificate — Craft, formerly known as the National Craft Certificate. This leaflet details progression routes to Levels 6, 7 and 8 full-time and part-time courses offered by a number of higher education institutions.While almost all universities are prepared to consider applications for transfer from HETAC (Higher Education and Training and Awards Council) or DIT (Dublin Institute of Technology) qualifications, the number of transfers has been falling as opportunities to progress to degree level programmes within the institutes of technology have increased.

This is separate from investments planned for the sector in the course of the current year.  Investments since 2007 have enabled the Government expend €69m on dedicated research projects under Cycles 3 and 4 of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRLTI) thereby advancing national strategic objectives of creating a knowledge economy. Further funding will be expended in the current year again on Cycle 3 and Cycle 4 projects. The Deputy will also be aware that earlier this year I announced the launch of Cycle 5 of PRLTI with planned investments of €300m in generating research capacity.In addition to PRTLI sponsored initiatives, the Government also funded a €58m investment programme in upgrading existing research facilities. A total of 19 higher education institutions around the country benefited from this scheme last year.  In 2007, the Government invested €28m in funding a dedicated research equipment grant.In terms of under graduate facilities, the Government has provided almost €30m to the institute of technology sector since 2007 to enable institutes undertake programmes of minor works. Additionally, there are 14 mainstream large scale capital projects currently at construction within the sector. Among them are an IT Building at NUI Cork; Engineering Building at Athlone IoT; refurbishment of the Carroll's Facility at Dundalk IoT and second phase of the campus re-development at Mary Immaculate College of Education in Limerick. Phase 1 of the campus development at Mary Immaculate College completed construction in  2008 together with a further 15 projects.A further 10 capital projects are at varying stages of planning with the target of being on site later this year / early 2010. Among them are the Engineering School at NUI Galway; new library facility at NUI Maynooth; new Law School at NUI Dublin and re-development of St. Patrick's College of Education in Dublin. These latter projects are also separate from the Third Level Public Private Partnership Programme which involves three bundles of 17 projects across 9 institutions all of which are also progressing. These building projects will deliver enhanced facilities in the key strategic areas such as Engineering, IT, Science and Technology, Catering, Tourism and the Arts.

Central to this is the "Special Education Support Service" (SESS) which was established in September 2003. The service consolidates co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings. These settings include mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special schools and special classes.The CPD provided by the SESS covers a range of specialities, including inter alia:Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)DyslexiaChallenging BehaviourPost-primary issues in Special Educational NeedsSpecialist training for Autism Units attached to schoolsThe SESS has also been involved in the provision of intensive CPD for teachers working in new Autism Units opened since 2007. Delivery of this CPD begins prior to their entry to the units and continues following the opening of the unit with ongoing in school support as well as programmes of CPD. Furthermore, as part of an initiative rolled out for the 08/09 school year, teachers can  have SESS CPD in the area of ASDs accredited by St Angela's College in Sligo.My Department is in the process of establishing a Special Educational Needs Behaviour Team as part of the SESS. This team will have responsible for the delivery of CPD and support to consolidate teachers' knowledge and skills in behavioural support and in the application of behavioural principles to learning through the use of contemporary applied behaviour analysis strategies. A person has already been appointed to oversee this programme and they will have a support team working with them, three of whom have been appointed recently.In addition, my Department funds several third level courses in teacher training colleges and universities. These include:Combined Post-Graduate Diploma Programme of Continuing Professional Development for Teachers involved in Learning Support & Special Education (available in seven colleges across the country) (300 places available annually).Masters in Special Educational Needs (St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra) (16 places available annually)Graduate Certificate in the education of pupils with ASD (St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra) (18 places available annually)Online Certificate/Diploma in Education (Special/Inclusive Education) (150 places available annually)My Department and the Centre For Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin are currently in the process of developing a new programme of continuing professional development. This programme will be designed to provide teachers with the skills necessary for the design, implementation and evaluation of learning and teaching programmes for students who have a hearing impairment and who are learning through the medium of Irish Sign Language. It is expected the programme will be available to teachers in 2009.It is estimated that over 25,000 places will be provided to teachers for Continuing Professional Development in Special Educational Needs in 2009, rising from 23,283 places in 2008.In terms of training for Special Needs Assistants, my Department currently funds a certificate for Special Needs Assistants delivered by:St. Angela's college, Sligo (55 places available annually)Mary Immaculate College, Limerick (45 places available annually)Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines (25 places available annually)Introductory courses are also provided through Education Centres, which can be taken as a stand alone course or as part of the above-mentioned certificate.

People with disabilities are one of the target groups of the programme.The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS), while primarily targeting the unemployed, also facilitates people with disabilities. Under VTOS, full-time courses of one or two years duration are provided to participants to enhance their employability.Adults with disabilities may also avail of adult literacy courses provided by VECs around the country. A grant has been provided to the Irish Deaf Society to train tutors to give literacy tuition. A grant is also awarded annually to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland as a contribution towards assessments.An action research pilot project is continuing in a number of Further Education Colleges in the Dublin area. This project is supported by three Disability Support Officers, the National Training and Development Institute and flexible additional funds for transport, equipment, interpreters, etc. The service identifies and offers support to students and staff around the area of disability. The provision of awareness-raising sessions and participation in college open and recruitment days is also an integral element of the role of the Support Officers.My Department is also currently working with the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education and the Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD) to address special education needs of adults in further education.In 2006/2007, a total of 2,444 students with disabilities attending third level and further education accessed funding through the Fund for People with Disabilities which is administered by the Higher Education Authority. The total amount provided to students through this fund was €9.987 million. Of this €1.745 million was allocated to 279 students in the further education sector.In 2008, AHEAD, in conjunction with the National Council for Guidance in Education (NCGE) launched a Handbook for Guidance and Information Officers on disability issues in Further Education.Following the input of key stakeholders on possible ways forward for the development of services for people with intellectual disabilities, a scoping paper on the parameters of provision for adults with disabilities in adult education and lifelong learning was received in 2008. This is forming part of the consideration and development of an overall policy to address special needs and disability in Further Education.

The Schemes also provide that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.  Notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course which represents progressions from the level at which the previous postgraduate qualification(s) was attained, may be deemed eligible for grant aid. My Department has provided clarification to the local authorities and VECs on establishing progression at post-graduate level for the purposes of grant eligibility.The decision on eligibility for student maintenance grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority, either the local authority or VEC, as appropriate. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department, except in exceptional circumstances.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

However, for pupils with special needs, the school is free to adapt this programme or to offer fewer examination subjects if such an approach more appropriately meets the needs of the pupil(s) concerned.  It may also be possible to avail of a reasonable accommodation in the certificate examinations (such as modified questions, use of adaptive technology, etc.) if the nature of the disability is such that a pupil would otherwise be unable to access the examination or demonstrate his/her abilities. If a lesser number of subjects is being offered, the school should include an accompanying note with its annual pupil database returns to my Department, to the effect that the pupil has special needs. This will ensure that my Department's IT system accepts the pupil as a recognised pupil for grant and teacher allocation purposes. The examination system is designed to provide certification for candidates either in single subjects, or in any number of subjects.I would advise the pupil's parents to discuss this matter fully with the school so that he has every opportunity to complete a challenging and successful programme in line with his needs.

These guidelines have been informed by broad consultation. The guidelines are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.Each Board of Management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient Code of Behaviour. This Code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption-free environment. The Code should also include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils. Section 23 of the Education Welfare Act, 2000 requires: (2) A Code of Behaviour shall specify:(a) the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending  the school;(b) the measures that may be taken when a student fails or refuses to observe  those standards;(c) the procedures to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled  from the school concerned;(d) the grounds for removing a suspension imposed in relation to a student; and(e) the procedures to be followed relating to notification of a child's absence  from school.Section 23(4) of the Education Welfare Act, 2000 requires, (4) The principal of a recognised school shall, before registering a child as a student at that school in accordance with Section 20, provide the parents of such child with a copy of the Code of Behaviour in respect of the school and may, as a condition of so registering such child, require his or her parents to confirm in writing that the Code of Behaviour so provided is acceptable to them and that they shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with such Code by the child.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1459	Teaching posts which have been historically provided to 73 post primary schools under previous disadvantage schemes are being withdrawn from September 2009. These schools were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. The withdrawal of these posts will take effect from 31 August 2009.Following the introduction of DEIS, a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure, to Non DEIS schools in receipt of resources under pre-existing schemes, that they would retain a level of support in line with their size and disadvantage levels for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.Unfortunately, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices had to be made in order to contain public sector spending. One of these decisions is the withdrawal of disadvantaged area scheme posts, Home School Community Liaision posts and additional financial resources from all Non DEIS schools with effect from 31 August 2009. The main focus of Social Inclusion measures is to retain resources in schools participating in DEIS, as there is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1460	In primary and post-primary schools, the in-school evaluation stage of WSE generally does not exceed five school days. Pre-evaluation meetings with the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee (if it is a VEC school), the trustees (if a meeting is requested with the evaluation team), the board of management, principal and deputy principal/s, representatives of the parents' association and the teaching staff generally take place during the week before the in-school evaluation phase. These meetings are normally convened on the same day. During the post-evaluation phase, meetings are held with the principal and deputy principal/s, the teaching staff, and the board of management. Again, these meetings are normally scheduled for the same day. In the course of a WSE, inspectors interact with students in classrooms and learning areas and at post-primary level a meeting is held with student council representatives. The post-evaluation phase takes a number of weeks, culminating in the issuing of the WSE report to the school principal and the board of management. Details of the WSE process are set out in ‘A Guide to Whole-School Evaluation' (Primary and Post-primary versions) published by my department in 2006. The publications are available on my department's website.In the last four years (2005 — 2008), 880 primary schools and 229 post-primary schools have been evaluated under the WSE model. While none of these schools has received a second WSE to date, I should point out that there is no specific time span set between a particular school receiving one WSE and the next. Decisions regarding the schools where WSEs are to be conducted are made by the inspectorate on an ongoing basis. While WSE is only in operation since 2004, it is possible that some schools could receive a second WSE before other schools receive their first should that be deemed desirable or necessary.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, one of the functions of the inspectorate under the Education Act is to visit schools and centres for education on the initiative of the inspectorate and WSE is only one of a range of formats employed by the inspectorate in its annual inspection programme. The balance between the various models of evaluation used within the inspection programme will vary over time depending on the needs of the system and changing quality assurance priorities. I can assure the Deputy that the inspectorate has frequent engagement with a great many schools each year through inspection visits. For example, in 2008 the inspectorate conducted a total of more than 3,500 inspections in schools and centres for education including the inspection of more than 2,600 newly qualified teachers in primary schools and 710 subject/programme inspections in post-primary schools in addition to 305 whole-school evaluations. I am satisfied that the scope of this inspection activity, in terms of coverage of schools, ensures a high level of external quality assurance of schools at both first and second levels.Full details of the inspection reports that have been published are available on my department's website www.education.gov.ie

The number of teachers nationally at primary level at 30 September, 2008 was 31,134 and at post-primary level was 26,994. The application of the budgetary measures is expected to reduce the numbers in each sector by 200 posts in September, 2009.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level in relation to both staffing and grant levels were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall net impact of the budget measures on teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year. I can do this when the allocation process has been completed.At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for the schools in the area referred to by the Deputy, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.

In addition, total reckonable income must not exceed a specified amount, which is €20,147 in the 2007 tax year. Finally, on the operative date, 31st December 2007 for the 2008/09 academic year, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments prescribed under the scheme.Illness Benefit is considered to be a short-term payment and, therefore, it is not included as an eligible payment for the purposes of the special rates of maintenance grant.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1469	DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification  processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools who applied for the review in August, 2006. There was an application for review received from the school to which the Deputy refers. Regrettably, the school was unsuccessful in that process.The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2006-2010. There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1470	The Education Act of 1998 recognises the role of patrons in the ownership and management of schools in Ireland.  The patron has ultimate responsibility for the school ethos, the appointment of the board of management, financial and legal matters and the supervision of staff appointments in accordance with Department regulations. Patrons generally discharge their responsibilities in close consultation with boards of management and other interested parties involved in the schools.Generally, my Department would not withdraw recognition from a recognised school unless it was deemed that the school was no longer required to serve the needs of a particular area. Where two or more schools amalgamate to form a new school, recognition is withdrawn from the amalgamating schools and the new school, with the appropriate Patron, is recognised as a new entity.  In the  event of a Patron withdrawing from a particular school, necessitating a change in patron, the school would continue to operate should it be required to serve the needs of that area. My Department would enter into discussions with that Patron and with other established Patron bodies to identify a suitable patron for the school.  However, the school would not lose its recognition by the  Department in such circumstances.

As the school in question is not one of the 100 Primary Urban Band 1 DEIS schools serving the most disadvantaged communities, its application for inclusion in the scheme could not be considered and the Deputy was advised accordingly.  The announcement made on 5th January related to the provision of €2.2m in ICT equipment grants for 72 primary schools in which a newly constructed school or large-scale extension was completed in 2008.  These grants are payable under my Department's School Building Programme and are only payable to schools where major construction work was completed in 2008. As the school in question does not fall into this category, it is not eligible for this specific funding.  I acknowledge the need for ongoing investment in schools' ICT infrastructure and I remain committed to investing in this area within available resources.  I would point out to the Deputy that it is open to the school concerned to use the Minor Works grant for National School Properties to purchase ICT equipment.  The grant for 2008/09 has recently issued to schools on the basis  of a €5,500 basic grant per school plus €18.50 per mainstream pupil.

With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 was on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  Accordingly my Department focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme.The table highlights the large number of major projects which were brought to completion with 48 new primary schools and 3 new post-primary schools completed under the programme in 2008.  In addition, 29 major primary school extension and refurbishment projects and the 15 major post-primary extension and refurbishment projects were completed in 2008.Taken together, these major projects reflect the concentration by my Department in 2008 on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country and represent an unprecedented level of achievement.  I recognise the benefits of the Summer Works Scheme in addressing the needs of schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009. The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009 and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are currently being considered and will be completed as soon as possible.The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.CountyRoll NoSchoolYearCarlow20295KCarlow Town Educate Together2008Cavan19983BSt Clares NS Ballyjamesduff2008Cork19433MHoly Family SS, Charleville2008Cork20204EKilworth NS, Cork2008Donegal17036PSN Naomh Colmchille Killmacrennan2008Dublin15315JSt George’s N.S., Balbriggan2008Dublin16786HSt. Brigid’s Convent NS, The Coombe2008Dublin19946SRutland St NS Dublin 12008Dublin20052HGaelscoil Colmcille2008Dublin20176CRush and Lusk Educate Together2008Dublin20186FCastaheany Educate Together Ns, Ongar, Dublin 152008Dublin20201VTyrrellstown Educate Together2008Dublin20241KScoil Choilm, Diswellstown,Porterstown2008Dublin20247WScoil Ghrianne Community N.S., Phibblestown2008Dublin20252PGaelscoil Balbriggan2008Dublin20282BBracken Educate Together, Balbriggan2008Dublin20302ESwords Applewood2008Dublin20303GClonborris, Lucan2008Dublin20304IBelmayne, St Francis N.S.2008Dublin20307OSkerries — Kelly’s Bay2008Dublin20308QBelmayne2008Dublin17055TSaggart2008Dublin20060GMonkstown Educate Together NS2008Kildare16705EAthy2008Kildare19786WCastledermot Mixed NS2008Kildare20159CNaas2008Kildare20257CScoil Naomh Padraig, Celbridge2008Kildare20292EMaynooth Educate Together2008Kilkenny17657BAn Tobar Mhuire Bhuac, Thomastown2008Laois15556IPortarlington Convent NS2008Laois20081OPortlaoise2008Limerick08926BSt Nicholas Church of Ireland School2008Louth20294INorth Drogheda Environs,Drogheda2008Mayo15866ACarrakennedy NS, Westport2008Meath18044TSN Naomh Padraig, Stamullen2008Monaghan20120VScoil Chroi Ro Naofa Clones2008Offaly20189LTullamore Educate Together2008Sligo19688WDromore West Central NS2008Tipperary19968FGaelscoil Durlas Eile2008Westmeath16914NBaile Coireil NS, Coralstown2008Westmeath19848SSt Etchen’s, Kennegad2008Westmeath19948WSN gCeithre Maistrí, Diseart Mhuire, Bothar na Dithreibhe2008Westmeath20188JMullingar Educate Together2008Wexford20165UGaelscoil Mhiosolog, Gorey2008Wexford20214HGorey Educate Together2008Wicklow06176UBlessington 1 NS2008Wicklow20300AEducate Together Greystones2008Wicklow20301CGaelscoil Greystones2008CountyRoll NoSchoolYearCarlow14837LSN Peadar agus Pol Ballon Carlow2008Cavan11541VDromaili SN Cavan2008Cork18279ACarrigaline 3 NS Carragline2008Donegal19553WDungloe Central2008Dublin19015RSt. Joseph’s Girls National School, Finglas, Dublin 112008Dublin19769WScoil Thomais Laurel Lodge, Castleknock2008Dublin19945QRathfarnham Educate Together Loreto Avenue2008Dublin20091RSt Peters NS Phibsboro2008Galway17198SSN Muire Gan Smal2008Galway17485CBriarhill NS2008Galway17771WLisheenkyle NS2008Galway20115FScoil Einne, Spiddeal2008Kerry19548GNano Nagle NS Lixnaw2008Kildare08099PSt Laurence’s NS, Sallins2008Kilkenny15340ICarrigeen NS2008Laois16617HBallyadams NS2008Laois20118LScoil Bhride Clonaslee2008Leitrim20203CMohill NS2008Louth17124MArdee Monastery2008Mayo19916JSt Peter’s NS2008Offaly11203BSt Kieran’s NS, Clareen2008Tipperary18207VSN Baile an Atha2008Waterford13635RBallyduff NS, Kilmeaden2008Waterford18462OScoil Lorcain2008Waterford19539FSt. Pauls Junior School, Lisduggan2008Waterford19853LGaelscoil Portláirge2008Wexford14254KSN Mhuire, Danescastle2008Wexford16145PLoreto Primary School Gorey2008Wexford19739NScoil Mhuire Coolcotts2008CountyRoll No.SchoolYearDublin91305LBallinteer Community School2008Limerick64220ASt Clements College, South Circular Road2008Limerick71920TSt Nessan’s Community College2008CountyRoll No.SchoolYearCork62200HColaiste Muire Crosshaven2008Cork62320RSt Mary’s Secondary School, Macroom2008Cork62560OColaiste Chriost Ri, Capwell Road, Cork2008Donegal71242BGairm Scoil Chú Uladh Leifear2008Donegal81010JSt Columba’s Community School, Glenties2008Dublin70342ABallyfermot College,2008Dublin60511OBeneavin De La Salle Finglas Dublin 112008Limerick76073GCastletroy CC2008Mayo64630TJesus and Mary Gortnor Abbey Crossmolina2008Mayo72130SSt Patrick’s College Lacken Cross Killala2008Tipperary65340PPresentation SS, Clonmel2008Westmeath63210POur Lady’s Bower SS, Retreat Rd, Athlone2008Wexford71650QKilmuckridge Vocational School2008Wicklow61820JLoreto S.S.

A further €4.5 billion is being invested under the current NDP 2007-2013.  This multi-annual funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation.In 2008 my Department invested €643.978m, the maximum amount of capital funding available, on improving existing and providing new facilities at schools around the country. The construction period of the majority of major projects, approved by my Department, spans two calendar years involving funding being provided in two different financial years on one project. It is only when a project can be started and completed within a financial year that the full cost of the project can be drawn down within that year.

The issue of road safety measures outside the vested site areas of schools, such as road signage, traffic calming measures etc., is a matter that should be raised in the first instance with the relevant Local Authority. Local Authorities have the power to decide on road safety measures outside schools and should ensure that measures are in place to protect the safety of local school children.

The initiative started in 2008 and is being piloted in 24 schools.  The curriculum changes will be phased in over three years and mainstreaming will begin in 2010, prefaced by a national programme of professional development for teachers beginning in 2009.  Starting in the Project schools allows the opportunity to trial the changes and to develop lesson plans and exemplars for teachers at the same time.  It will help to ensure that the optimum level of resources are available in advance, when the changes are introduced in the mainstream system, beginning in September 2010.  It will enable the student experience, which is central to effective learning, to feed into the final syllabus development so that we can ensure the best possible approach to ensuring relevance and quality in the new reforms.Students in the 24 schools involved in the initial implementation from September 2008 are experiencing mathematics in a new way. Teachers are being provided with classroom materials to enable them to adopt the new approaches and will be supported professionally in embracing change.  These materials and supports will include lesson plans, with teacher guides and student worksheets, online exemplars and a range of assessment materials.The NCCA website www.ncca.ie. sets out the draft syllabus for Strands 1 and 2 at junior and senior cycle, a draft common Mathematics course for the first year in junior cycle, and a Geometry course.  The website www.ProjectMaths.ie sets out additional supports in the form of teaching and learning plans, a forum for teachers, and additional resources.  These resources will expand over time.  My Department does not generally produce textbooks for schools.  However, the NCCA has been in touch with the educational publishers association about the changes to Mathematics.Project Maths will be supported by intensive investment in professional development for teachers.  A Maths Support Team has been appointed and is currently supporting the project schools, as well as preparing for mainstream in-service development which will start in September 2009, followed by mainstream implementation starting in Sept 2010.  Some €3m has been provided for the programme in 2009.Project Maths is being implemented on a phased basis covering the following five strands of mathematics:Phase 1 Strand 1 statistics and probability; Strand 2  geometry and trigonometryPhase 2  Strand 3  number; Strand 4  algebraPhase 3  functionsPhase 3 will have begun in all schools in 2012, and will be fully implemented  in all class groups by 2015.

The project, which is scheduled to run from 2008 to at least 2013, will see the incremental development of revised syllabuses in Junior and Leaving Certificate Mathematics alongside a significant programme of teacher professional development.In both junior cycle and senior cycle mathematics syllabuses, five strands of mathematics have been identified: Statistics and Probability, Geometry and Trigonometry, Number, Algebra and Functions.  Syllabus revisions will be undertaken in each strand and the changes will be introduced on a phased basis. Initially the strands are being introduced in a small group of 24 pilot schools. Teachers in the pilot schools will attend three days of Project Maths in-service/workshops in the current school year.There are plans to begin the mainstream roll-out of in-service on Strands to all maths teachers from September 2009 with training taking place in school time and funded by my Department.  The implementation of the Strands will take place in the year after in-service has been delivered.  The estimated cost to my Department of the project in 2009 is in the region of €3m.

The terms of the 2008 Higher Education Grants Scheme and the V.E.C.  Scholarships Scheme provide for the payment by the Local Authorities/V.E.C.s of each maintenance grant in three equal instalments as early as possible in each academic term.  The payable orders are addressed to the grantholder c/o the Bursar's Office of the College.  As you will appreciate, payment of the first instalment of the academic year cannot issue in respect of new grant applicants until registration on an approved course has been confirmed.  In relation to grant renewals, awards cannot issue until successful academic attainment has been confirmed in respect of the previous end of year examinations.The Student Support Bill was published in February 2008 and provides the legislative framework for the reform of the administration of student grants and the amalgamation of the existing four student grant schemes into a single unified scheme which will be provided for by way of regulation.The Bill is part of an overall programme of legislative and administrative reform, which will facilitate the introduction of significant service level improvements in the administration of student grants, providing for greater consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants to those who need them most.  It will include guaranteed timeframes for the assessment of grants, an independent appeals procedure and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments.  The establishment of set payment dates for student grants is being considered in the context of the Programme of Reform.

The priority target group of Further Education programmes generally is those who are educationally disadvantaged and who lack basic skills.The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS), funded by my Department and operated through the 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs), provides full-time education and training opportunities for adults who are over the age of 21 and in receipt of specific social welfare payments.  There are 5,000 places on the VTOS.It is also open to persons who wish to return to education who are not eligible to enrol on a VTOS programme to apply for a place on the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI).  The BTEI provides part-time programmes for young people and adults and is free to anyone, including unemployed persons, with less than upper second level education.  It gives those who wish to return to education an opportunity to combine their return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities.  Programmes are offered on a part-time basis in the mornings, afternoons, evenings or at weekends.If the Deputy wishes to supply further detail about the circumstances of this case I will have it examined by my officials.

The needs of the young people that the project aims to address include certification, preparation for work, a positive attitude towards society, communication, computer and recreational skills.My Department has provided funding to this project towards programme costs, through the Fund for the Development of Targeted Educational Responses to Certain Children at Risk, since 2000.  The objective of the Fund is to develop preventative and supportive programmes, which are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion.  A key focus of the initiative is the empowerment of local communities to develop innovative and flexible programmes that address identified needs of intended participants.The project has also been supported by my Department through an annual allocation of 968 teaching hours under the Co-Operation with Other Institutions Scheme since 2001.  A Review of the Co-operation Hours Scheme is currently being finalised.  While the allocation of resources to individual schools is not a matter for the Review to examine, the policy under which such allocations are made are being considered as part of this Review.The project indicated in their application for funding, that they also receive support through other sources such as fund-raising, and HSE.  Seven projects, including this project, will be evaluated by the Evaluation Support and Research Unit of my Department in conjunction with the Inspectorate in early 2009.  It is expected that the evaluation will make recommendations as to the future arrangements for supporting appropriate projects and/or models of intervention.

My department is also conducting a review of the procedures which underpin the operation of the appeals system.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1502	The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the national body with responsibility for school attendance. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.The overall development and ongoing performance of the Board is kept under review by my Department. The Board publishes educational welfare service activity data including caseloads, prosecutions and numbers of children registered as being educated outside of school in its Annual Report. The Board's service has developed incrementally and the Board now has a total of 109 posts. Of the 109 posts, 90 are involved in the delivery of services to children, families and schools. The Board operates through 5 Regional Teams at 30 locations nationwide. The budget allocation to the Board has also followed this incremental trend:YearAllocation€m20034.31020046.51420057.83820068.15020079.808200810.085The Board's network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) is the key means by which the Board delivers on its statutory remit to ensure that each child attends and benefits from education. EWOs deal with approximately 10,000 cases, involving children with reported school attendance difficulties, per annum. Officers work closely with the family, the school and other support services to  address the particular issues for each child.The NEWB is one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators (HSCL) through their work with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school. School attendance is a central objective of the School Completion Programme (SCP) with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies. Access to these services is available to all schools participating in DEIS. In line with Department policy on closer integration of support services the NEWB is working with these programmes to improve the delivery of service to address school attendance. This approach aims to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.In line with Government policy the Board prioritises its resources to support the most disadvantaged areas and schools participating in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the Action Plan for educational inclusion. EWOs provide an intensive service in these areas. Outside of these areas, priority is given to children who are out of school or who have significant  difficulties with school attendance.Interventions designed to tackle the underlying causes of poor attendance at school by necessity are long term measures.  DEIS has been designed as the long term plan for educational inclusion in the most disadvantaged areas.  The Department has commissioned the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct an independent evaluation of DEIS over the period of the action plan to 2010.  This evaluation is aiming to monitor the effectiveness of the programme (and its various elements) and assess its impact on students, families, schools, and communities at primary and post-primary levels.  The thrust of the evaluation is systemic in the sense that it is designed to inform policy making on the role that initiatives like DEIS can play in addressing educational disadvantage, promoting social inclusion and to identify models of good practice in the application of resources and supports.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1503	My previous response to the Deputy set out the estimated savings arising from the change in the staffing schedules. The estimates for my Department's budget for 2009 have been prepared on the same fundamental basis as any other year by estimating the number of teachers that will be employed under the different categories given the policies in place, for example, mainstream classroom teachers, special needs and language support teachers and allowing for any change in overall demographics.Specifically in relation to mainstream classroom teachers, the yield in savings that will result from the change in the primary staffing schedules will ultimately depend on the aggregate impact of the revised staffing schedule on the particular enrolment profile of all schools countrywide as of 30 September last and the operation of the panel system of redeployment. The full year saving is estimated at €6 million for every 100 teaching posts saved. My Department's estimating range for the yield from the staffing schedule adjustment for primary schools is 350- 500 posts saving up to €30 million in a full year. Since the potential yield from this reduction and from the policy changes giving reductions in posts will be offset by new posts due to demographic changes in some schools and the continued policy of allocating special needs posts through the work of the National Council for Special Education the net reduction from the primary sector is estimated to be of the order of 200 posts.The position for the post-primary sector (i.e. across VEC, Community and Comprehensive schools and not just secondary schools) is that the changed allocation ratios could ultimately yield up to €64m in a full year. However, actual yield will depend on the functioning of a new redeployment scheme yet to be agreed and is also a factor of the extent to which in any locality it will  be possible to match teachers that are surplus in some schools with vacancies in their subject specialisms in other schools. Accordingly, the measure will only work through over a number of years and for this reason the yield in 2009 is estimated at up to €8m. Again as is the case in the primary sector the net yield of 200 posts factors in other measures that will reduce the number of  posts offset by increases largely related to the expansion of special needs provision elsewhere.The Deputy will appreciate that while a measure will only yield a portion of that saving in 2009 it is the full year yield that is most relevant given that the Government strategy is to manage the correction needed in the public finances over the coming years as distinct from the 2009 position alone.  I have already put it on record that I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally what the final impact is on the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year. I am not claiming in any way that there will be no impact on the staffing position in schools generally but this will vary from school to school and there will be schools where the number of teachers will remain the same.I will set out the final position when the allocation processes have been completed. The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence shortly. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme. The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned are considered. Also at post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota.For the moment the priority for my Department is to move ahead with the allocation processes and begin the interaction with individual schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1504	Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. It is a matter for the school to employ teachers up to the limit of its approved allocation and at its discretion to deploy those teachers to the subject areas that the school chooses to provide.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently.Specific information in relation to the detailed staffing allocations that individual schools will have for the commencement of the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation processes have fully concluded. There is nothing exceptional in this. The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned. Up to now there has not been an effective system wide redeployment scheme at post-primary but discussions on the arrangements for redeployment that will apply in the case of teachers that become surplus in situations other than school closure will re-commence shortly and the parties have agreed that these discussions will be finalised by end March 2009. Discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties and these allocations can alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to any over quota position.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1505	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1499, 1535, 1543 and 1575 together.I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.In relation to staffing, when the country was able to afford it we reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of primary pupils per teacher from 35 pupils in 1995/96 down to the current level of 27 pupils. This is reflected in the improvements that we have made on class sizes over the years and these improvements reflect our commitment to education. The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher from September 2009 has to be viewed in that context. Although it reverses some of the progress that we have made in recent years I had no option but to curtail the annual increase in teacher numbers. The reduced class sizes for the most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools of an average of 1 teacher for every 20 pupils in Junior classes and an average of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils in Senior classes are not affected by the Budget decision.While the budget measures will impact on class sizes it will be necessary in the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone. While teacher numbers are important numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor — far and above anything else — in improving educational outcomes for children. Ensuring high quality teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it represent a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and indeed the teacher unions.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence shortly. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.  I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.

However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.The Transport Liaison Officer for Co. Clare has advised that the family referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, do not reside in the catchment area where they attend post primary school and are currently availing of transport on a concessionary basis.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1509	I wish to reemphasise that there are no changes proposed in respect of the Protestant Block Grant.  Protestant fee-charging schools receive — and will continue to receive — the Protestant Block grant, which in the current school year amounts to €6.25 million.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.  The grant is distributed by the Secondary Education Committee among disadvantaged Protestant children.  Applications are made by parents to the Central Protestant Churches Authority, which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance that I, and this Government, continue to attach to ensuring that students of the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.  Furthermore in retaining this grant the Government is being faithful to the separate arrangements that were agreed with the Protestant schools when the free scheme was introduced by Donagh O'Malley and, at the time, it was the payment of a block grant in particular for Protestant fee-charging schools that distinguished them from the Catholic schools that also chose to continue to charge fees.In addition to the block grant, Protestant fee-charging schools were paid a range of support services grants that the Catholic fee-charging schools did not receive.  The purpose of these grants was not to offset fees for disadvantaged Protestant students.  It is estimated that savings of €2.8 million will accrue as a result of the withdrawal of these grants from the Protestant fee-charging schools in 2009.I have had take decisions in relation to a range of grants that have impacted on the funding of schools generally.  With the Protestant Block Grant protected, I can see no justification for treating the Protestant fee-charging schools in a special way, particularly given that Catholic fee-charging schools have not been in receipt of the grants in question at all.The Government also decided to make changes to how fee-charging schools should be treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they would be allocated.  In fee-charging schools, the pupil-teacher ratio is now set at 20:1.  Fee-charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.In relation to staffing resources either for teachers or support services, I do not see any reasonable basis for discriminating on grounds of religious denomination between fee-charging schools.  There is a particular historic rationale for providing particular support to the Protestant schools through the Block grant, and as I have said, it is being maintained.

This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.The criteria for allocating additional teaching and/or special needs assistant support for children with special educational needs, including autism, were not changed as part of the budget announcements. The rate of capitation funding payable in respect of special classes for autism attached to mainstream primary schools and special schools for children with autism was significantly  increased from €880 per pupil to €986 per pupil.The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 345 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service.

The universities have formally communicated their collective view that the introduction of bonus points is not likely to achieve the national objective of greater participation in science engineering and technology programmes, and have advocated other approaches which they consider are more potentially effective. The Report of the Points Commission in 1999 considered the issue of bonus points and recommended against such an approach on the grounds that it would lead to a narrowing of the range of subjects taken by students, create pressure on students to make early career choices, give rise to equity issues where the subject was not available and lead to distortions in third level access and provision.

Macquarie Partnership for Ireland (MPFI) has been selected as the preferred tenderer for the provision of this Bundle. The National Development Finance Agency, who are responsible for the procurement phase,  has almost finalised contractual details with MPFI and is awaiting the completion of financing terms by MPFI and its chosen financiers.  The contract for these four schools cannot be signed until this process has been completed.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1522	The Government agreed a transition period to full water charges in the case of non-fee charging recognised schools.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed arrangements regarding the implementation of this decision.The transitional arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place water conservation arrangements and practices and to undertake works that can help reduce water usage significantly before full water charges are introduced.  By virtue of good water conservation, schools can be in a much stronger position to reduce the impact of water charges on their overall budgets.  Under the transition arrangements agreed by the Government, schools pay a flat rate per pupil fee as follows: 2007 — €3 per pupil, 2008 — €3.50 per pupil and 2009 — €4 per pupil enrolled. For 2007, charges applied based on metering were recalculated on the transitional flat rate with a credit given for any excess payment.Guidance was also issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists.  In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.  Furthermore, those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.In the context of reducing water costs for schools, it has been demonstrated that fitting simple water saving devices to toilets and sinks can reduce water consumption considerably at very little cost, as can other small works such as fixing easily identifiable leaks.  Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to fund such measures.  The minor works grant has increased by nearly 50% over the past two years and some €27m is due to issue to all primary schools in early 2009 under this grant scheme.My Department remains in close liaison with the Department of Environment and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any initiatives by it and local authorities that will help reduce water costs for schools.In relation to day to day funding for schools, I prioritised funding for primary schools in the recent budget, increasing the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level to €200 per pupil.  The increases in the enhanced rates for special needs pupils in special classes and special schools brings the top rate up to almost €1,000 per pupil.The capitation grant for post-primary schools has been increased by 4.3%, representing an increase of €14 per pupil, to bring it to €345 per pupil from January 2009.  Voluntary secondary schools will also benefit also from an increase in the school services support grant by €8 per pupil from January 2009.  This will mean, for example, that a secondary school with an enrolment of 500 pupils will receive an additional €11,000 in funding in 2009.  I clearly will want to improve funding as soon as circumstances permit, and in a manner which is consistent with overall prudent management of the economy.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1523	The Gaelcholáiste in question commenced operation in September 2004 having received temporary recognition from my Department.  An application for permanent recognition has been received and is currently being examined by my officials.  When this is completed, a decision will be notified to the school authorities.Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. It is a matter for the school to employ teachers up to the limit of its approved allocation and at its discretion to deploy those teachers to the subject areas that the school chooses to provide.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently.Specific information in relation to the detailed staffing allocations that individual schools will have for the commencement of the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation processes have fully concluded. There is nothing exceptional in this. The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned. Up to now there has not been an effective system wide redeployment scheme at post-primary but discussions on the arrangements for redeployment that will apply in the case of teachers that become surplus in situations other than school closure will re-commence shortly and the parties have agreed that these discussions will be finalised by end March 2009. Discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties and these allocations can alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to any over quota position.

I will address those aspects of the recommendations which pertain to education.Recommendation 1412 calls for national legislation to ensure that children are enrolled in schools and that there is appropriate intervention in the case of non-compliance.  This is in line with the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which provide that children must be enrolled in recognised schools, unless they are receiving an adequate education in another specified registered setting.  The National Educational Welfare Board, established under the Act has a statutory function to ensure that every child either attends a school or otherwise receives an education. The Board has a key role in following up on children who are not attending school regularly, and where there is a concern about the child's educational welfare. The Board also has responsibility for children who are being educated outside of schools e.g. those educated at home.  Recommendations 1178 and 1412 also include references to the curriculum, and recommend including information concerning personal and social rights and factual information on established religions and on the history and philosophy of important schools of religious thought in the curriculum.At primary level, social, personal and health education (SPHE) is a mandatory component of the primary curriculum.  SPHE provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help the child to create and maintain supportive relationships and to become an active responsible citizen in society. Human rights and citizenship education is dealt with in the early stages of primary schooling through the exploration of a child's immediate environment, developing an awareness of how to interact fairly with others, sharing, being aware of emotions and feelings, learning to treat others with dignity and respect, and learning to appreciate difference. As the curriculum progresses, broader community issues are brought into play, in terms of how individuals and groups contribute to their community, practising justice and fair play in everyday interactions, becoming aware of diverse groups and the importance of living together in harmony, the role of community leaders and community organisations, civic structures, equal rights and how justice and peace can be promoted between people and groups,  nationally and internationally.At post-primary level, Social, Personal and Health Education is a mandatory subject, but not an examination subject, at junior cycle.  At second level the key emphasis is on promoting self esteem and physical and mental/emotional well being, and responsible decision making. Belonging and integrating, appreciating difference, self management, communications, physical and emotional health, influences and decision making, bullying, coping with loss, handling conflict, substance abuse, personal safety, getting help, relationships and sexuality are covered.Civic, Social and Political Education is an examination subject and part of the core curriculum in junior cycle in post primary schools. The syllabus is based on a number of central concepts, which collectively inform and clarify the concept of citizenship. These include democracy, rights and responsibilities, human dignity and law. The syllabus helps students to develop their ability to explore, analyse and evaluate. It enables students to become skilled and practised in moral and critical appraisal and capable of making decisions and judgments, based on human rights and social responsibilities. In its methodology and assessment procedures, there is a significant bias towards the application of practical skills required for participatory citizenship. Thus, students are equipped to confront such issues as the work of groups, who might seek to impose their beliefs on others by illegal means or through the use of  undue pressure or duress.A new syllabus for Religious Education at Junior Cycle was introduced on an optional basis in September 2000. This syllabus is concerned with understanding religion as a phenomenon in the world and deals with the foundation of religious belief through a study of major world religions. It is designed to be studied by students of all religious faiths and of none. It was examined for the first time in the Junior Certificate examination in 2003. For the students taking this course, a syllabus for Religious Education can play a key role in promoting a respect for personal dignity and that of others, positive attitudes towards other cultures and ethnic groups, a commitment to the democratic process, and an awareness of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. A new syllabus for Religious Education at Senior Cycle was introduced in 2003 and was examined for the first time in the Leaving Certificate examination in 2005.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1533	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1537, 1538, 1542 and 1582 to 1584, inclusive, together.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the budget day announcements.   Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.  My Department is currently finalising the position of individual schools in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.The staffing allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers, my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels, which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore, the staffing schedule will be published, which is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.In relation to the school book grant, this grant is now available only to schools within the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) scheme.  By limiting the school book grant to schools within the DEIS scheme, savings of €7.5m will be achieved.  DEIS is the action plan for educational inclusion and focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.  Approximately €7 million was made available in 2008 to DEIS schools at primary and post-primary level for the school book grant scheme; this fund of €7 million will be made available for distribution to schools in the DEIS programme in 2009.  The continuation of the school book grant to these schools is testament to the Government's determination to prioritise social inclusion and protect the most vulnerable in our society.My Department continues to urge schools to implement book rental schemes as a measure to minimise the cost of school books to all parents.  This was the recommendation of a consultancy report, submitted to my Department in 1993, which dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books.  The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a Code of Good Practice for successful operation of book rental schemes.  My Department fully endorses the report's recommendations.In relation to the provision for teacher in-service education support, €28.8 million will be made available in 2009, compared with a 2008 estimate of €33.8 million.  It is intended to reduce teacher secondments to in-service and, while it will be possible to continue to provide a wide range of services to teachers, the reduced allocation will mean that programmes that are not in an expansionary or prioritised phase will have to be curtailed to a degree.In relation to sporting activities, school musicals, field trips and student exchanges, I refer the Deputies to my statement to the House on Thursday 4th December 2008 in response to a Priority Parliamentary Question.  I believe that the proposal which I outlined to the House will ensure that such activities will continue in our second level schools in 2009 pending a full review of the substitution and supervision scheme in conjunction with the school management bodies and teacher unions.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1535	I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.When the country was able to afford it we reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of primary pupils per teacher from 35 pupils in 1995/96 down to the current level of 27 pupils. This is reflected in the improvements that we have made on class sizes over the years and these improvements reflect our commitment to education. The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher from September 2009 has to be viewed in that context. Although it reverses some of the progress that we have made in recent years I had no option but to curtail the annual increase in teacher numbers. The reduced class sizes for the most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools of an average of 1 teacher for every 20 pupils in Junior classes and an average of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils in Senior classes are not affected by the Budget decision.While the budget measures will impact on class sizes it will be necessary in the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone. While teacher numbers are important numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor — far and above anything else — in improving educational outcomes for children. Ensuring high quality teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it represent a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and indeed the teacher unions.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence shortly. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of concessionary disadvantaged posts will impact on the affected schools, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult decisions had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.

The level of funding available to each sub programme for 2009 has not yet been finalised.Emergency Works Grants (EWG) are made available to schools most in need of resources as a result of unforeseen emergencies of a capital nature that may arise during the school year and need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Once a project is approved, funding is provided on a devolved basis and the level of grant is based on the estimated cost provided by a qualified Consultant on the application form.  70% of the cost of a project is provided to the applicant when work commences and the balance when the project is completed.626 EWG projects were approved in 2007 and 328 in 2008. €27m was paid out in 2007 and €13m in 2008 in respect of the 2007 approvals. Just over €9.5m was paid out in 2008 in respect of the 2008 approvals and the balance will be paid this year. It should be noted that depending on the commencement and completion dates of projects the funding may be paid over two calendar years.

Accordingly my Department focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme that year.I intend to have a Summer Works Scheme this year. The details of the operation of the scheme and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are currently being considered. The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools with their applications for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.

Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these  factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.Post-primary accommodation requirements in the Dublin 14 area, and any subsequent issues which may arise, such as the need for a new Irish language post-primary school will be considered in this regard.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1546	There are currently 56 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant, two inter-denominational, one Jewish and the remaining  32 Catholic.Fee-charging schools, with the exception of the Protestant and Jewish  fee-charging schools for which special arrangements apply, do not receive  capitation or related supports.Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, the  Protestant Block grant, which amounts to €6.25 million in the current school  year.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.  The grant  is distributed by the Secondary Education Committee among disadvantaged  Protestant children.  Applications are made by parents to the Central  Protestant Churches Authority which, on the basis of a means test, distributes  the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.A similar arrangement exists for the Jewish school and will continue also.  The arrangements for minority schools reflect the importance the Government  attaches to ensuring that students can attend schools that reflect their  denominational ethos.In retaining this grant, the Government is being faithful to the separate  arrangements that were agreed with the Protestant schools when the free scheme was introduced by Donagh O'Malley; at the time, it was the payment of a block grant in particular for Protestant fee-charging schools that distinguished them from the Catholic schools that also chose to continue to charge fees.Prior to Budget 2009, in addition to the block grant, Protestant fee-charging  schools were paid a range of support services grants that the Catholic  fee-charging schools did not receive.  It is estimated that savings of €2.8  million will accrue as a result of the withdrawal of these grants from the  Protestant fee-charging schools in 2009.Teachers in all fee-charging schools are paid by the State; this arrangement  pre-dated the introduction of free education arrangements.  In the absence of  fee-paying schools and the enrolment of all pupils in the non-fee  paying sector, there would be subsequent additional costs and teachers would  still have to be paid.In Budget 2009 the Government has, however, decided to make changes to how fee-charging schools should be treated in relation to the number of publicly  funded teaching posts they are allocated.  Teachers in fee-charging schools are  now allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20 to one, which is a point higher  than allocations in non fee-charging post-primary schools.  Fee-charging  schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their  fee income.

Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite  of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools in 2005/06  means that children with high incidence special needs now longer have to wait  for an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support.Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not  been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of  a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the  psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools  prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation  with the assigned psychologist.In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists  assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to  psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this Scheme, schools can  commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners  approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist  concerned.Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard to any of the foregoing I would suggest that they contact the relevant local NEPS  Regional Director, for whom contact details are also available on my  Department's website.I can also inform the Deputy that there are currently 155 psychologists  employed in my Department's NEPS service and a further psychologist is due to  take up duty shortly.Additionally I was pleased to announce recently, in the context of Budget 2009,  an increase in the funding available to NEPS with which it is envisaged that up  to 50 further psychologists can be appointed. Recruitment of these  psychologists will begin shortly from the existing panel of qualified  personnel, until its depletion, and discussions commence between my Department and the Public Appointments Service in relation to the establishment of a new panel in this regard.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1554	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1564 to 1567, inclusive, together.In order to meet the language needs of students in our schools whose first  language is not English, additional support is given to their schools which can  take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of  posts. The number of teaching posts allocated for this purpose in the each of  the two school years 2007/08 and 2008/09 was approximately 2,000, while the  corresponding figure for the 2006/07 school year was approximately 1,400  teaching posts.In addition, in the current school year approximately 430 primary schools have  received grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time language  support teachers. In the previous two school years, an average of 500 schools  received such grant assistance.The total cost of providing English language support to children in our primary  and post primary schools for the past three school years is estimated as  follows:2006/07: €89 million;2007/08: €125 million;2008/09: €139 million.I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. This obviously  impacted on the ability to follow through on commitments in the Programme for  Government. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.In relation to language support the budget measures will mean that the level of  language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per  school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.However, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support  teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of  immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those  pupils for whom this resource has been available.Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to  get it. We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teaching posts in  our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time  posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge  will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the  position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of  newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on  a case by case basis.In relation to the Irish language, the position is that my Department provides  a range of measures to support teaching and learning of Irish and through  Irish. These include: Supports for the establishment of Irish medium schools; Professional development for teachers at primary and post primary level through the Primary Curriculum Support Service and the Second Level  Support Service, under which 34 full time trainers are provided; Modular programmes for teachers through the education centre network; Provision of texts, materials and resources in Irish through the development of Séideán Sí and the work of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta; A range of higher education programmes through the medium of Irish.The estimated cost for each of the last three years of the range of supports  for the Irish language within our schools is not readily available within my  Department and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to  compile.

The Primary Professional Development Service now has responsibility  for the provision of support for primary language support teachers and the  Second Level Support Service has responsibility for the provision of support in  the post primary sector.The funding designated for IILT in relation to adult tuition was transferred to  the VEC sector and funding in relation to school support was utilised for the  development of language support resources.

When this is received and considered, the SENO will convey a decision on the  application directly to the school.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1557	DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying  levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the  Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices  and the Inspectorate. There are 876 schools in DEIS. These comprise 673 primary schools (199 Urban Band 1,141 Urban Band 2 and 333 Rural) and 203 second-level schools.In line with my focus on retaining resources in the most disadvantaged areas,  it is important to note that following Budget 2009, all DEIS supports in DEIS  schools are not being affected. Those DEIS schools which benefit from reduced  class sizes will not be affected by the general increase in the pupil teacher  ratio. All DEIS Urban Band 1 schools enjoy a lower Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR).  In addition some 53 DEIS Urban Band 2 schools enjoy a lower PTR from  pre-existing schemes. These reduced pupil teacher ratios are explicitly  protected under DEIS and are not affected by the Budget.While the funding for the book grant scheme has been reduced, the enhanced  capitation paid to DEIS schools will be increased to offset the loss of book  grant funding to DEIS schools. This additional funding will be paid to DEIS schools in the coming year and will be calculated in accordance with the mechanism used to calculate the existing disadvantage grants.For schools other than those that benefit from lower PTR under DEIS, the  mechanism used to allocate classroom teachers to primary schools is the  staffing schedule and, with effect from September 2009, the enrolment bands  will be based on an average of 28 pupils per class rather than the current 27  pupils per class. My Department will be advising individual schools in the  normal way in relation to their staffing allocations.The ceiling of two on the number of language support teachers per school is  being re-imposed, with some alleviation for the position of those schools where  there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the  overall pupil enrolment. This will be done on a case by case basis.In primary schools there will be substitute cover for teachers on uncertified  sick leave other than on the first day of absence. In a school where more than  one teacher is absent on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute  cover will be provided for the second and subsequent teachers that are absent.  In schools with two teachers or less cover will be provided where any classroom  teacher is absent.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of  public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and  to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure  could not be totally spared.Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so  significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious. Even with the  Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased  borrowing requirement in 2009.While I appreciate that the abolition of certain grants will make it a  challenging year ahead in terms of the day to day funding of schools, I have  prioritised funding for primary schools. The Education Budget for 2009 has  provided for improvements to capitation and ancillary grants for primary  schools which will increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in  2009. The budget improvements involve an increase of more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil and the ancillary services grant for primary schools  will also be improved by €3.50 to €155 per pupil. My Department will be  advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their grant  allocations.We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level  that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the  moment given economic circumstances. Targeting resources at the most  disadvantaged schools that are working to counteract educational disadvantage  will continue to be a priority for the Government.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1558	Teacher allocations to all second level schools (non DEIS and DEIS) are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based  on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school  management authority is required to organise its subject options within the  limit of its approved teacher allocation. It is a matter for the school to  employ teachers up to the limit of its approved allocation and at its  discretion to deploy those teachers to the subject areas that the school  chooses to provide.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of  public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to  ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect Education, while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure,  could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding  restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these  are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need  to manage Exchequer resources prudently.Specific information in relation to the detailed staffing allocations that  individual schools will have for the commencement of the academic year 2009/10  cannot be determined until the allocation processes have fully concluded. There  is nothing exceptional in this. The allocation processes include appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. This is particularly relevant at post-primary  level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific  curricular needs of the school concerned. Up to now there has not been an  effective system wide redeployment scheme at post-primary but discussions on  the arrangements for redeployment that will apply in the case of teachers that  become surplus in situations other than school closure will re-commence shortly  and the parties have agreed that these discussions will be finalised by end  March 2009. Discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example  to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language  difficulties and these allocations can alter the ultimate position of the  school in relation to any over quota position.In relation to recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Applied programme (LCA) the first group of 20 participating pupils in all schools in the free  education scheme, irrespective of the programme year, will attract an  allocation of 1.4 whole-time teacher equivalents. The allocation will apply in  the case of the first group even where the actual take-up of approved places is  fewer than 20. Each additional group of 20 participating pupils will attract an allocation of 1.18 WTE.The first group of 20 participating pupils in all fee paying schools,  irrespective of the programme year, will attract an allocation of 1.3 whole-time teacher equivalents. This allocation will apply in the case of the first group  even where the actual take-up of approved places is fewer than 20. Each additional group of 20 participating pupils will attract an allocation of  1.11 WTE.As a result of Budget 2009, the Leaving Certificate Applied grant has been  abolished with effect from 1 January 2009.  It is estimated that savings in the  order of €1.2 million will accrue as a result of its abolition.The Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA), taken by approximately 6% of students,  is subject to review, and appropriate revisions are made to ensure that needs  of all students in the intended target group are met in the best possible way.   This will continue to be the case, and I am confident that the Leaving  Certificate Applied will continue to be a viable option for students whose needs are not catered for by the other Leaving Certificate options.The capitation received by post primary DEIS schools has not been affected by  Budget 2009.

DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage.The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the  Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their  inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of  an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification  processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying  for a review. The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools  who applied for the review in August, 2006. There was an application for review  received from the school to which the Deputy refers. Regrettably, the school  was unsuccessful in that process.The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the  current DEIS programme which runs from 2006-2010. There will not be an  opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of  supports.

In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.

Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations. The staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand. The preparatory work for the staffing allocations has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that have been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence shortly. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall net impact of the budget measures on aggregate grant levels or teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year. I can do this when the allocation process has been completed.At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in order to create staffing or funding profiles for the school referred to by the Deputy, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1569	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1592 and 1616 together.The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers,  special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 345 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service. A recent initiative has been the expansion of this service to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team, led by a person with a PhD in ABA.My Department's ABA pilot scheme was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools. Now that a national network of special classes catering specifically for children with autism is available in schools, new centres will not be brought into the pilot programme.Officials in my Department have met on a regular basis with the relevant groups in relation to the commitment in the current programme for Government to long-term funding for the centres that are in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism.I am pleased to advise that broad agreement has been reached on the core conditions to enable the centres to be recognised as special schools for children with autism and discussions are ongoing in relation to existing contractual arrangements.

Initially, a block of 10 new classrooms was delivered in August 2008, ready for the 2008/2009 school year.Also at Primary level, my Department identified the need to expand Scoil Bhríde from a 16 to a 24-classroom school.An application for a new school building from St David's NS, and an application from Convent of Mercy NS for an extension and refurbishment of their existing building, have been received in my Department.At Post-Primary level, a building project for Meánscoil Iognáid Rís, consisting of a new 4 storey extension was recently approved to proceed to construction.The relocation of St. Patrick's Post Primary school is expected to be completed later this year.Clongowes Wood made an application in 2007, for Capital funding, to replace existing prefabricated accommodation with a permanent structure.The progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an on-going basis in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. In light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of any outstanding projects at this time.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1580	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1607 to 1612, inclusive, together.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level in relation to both staffing and grant levels were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing allocations.  The staffing schedule will be published and it  is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.  The preparatory work for the staffing allocations has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence shortly.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.  This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned.  Up to now there has not been an effective system wide redeployment scheme at post-primary but discussions on the arrangements for redeployment that will apply in the case of teachers that become surplus in situations other than school closure will re-commence shortly and the parties have agreed that these discussions will be finalised by end March 2009.  Discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties and these allocations can alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to any over quota position.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall net impact of the budget measures on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I can do this when the allocation process has been completed.At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for the schools referred to by the Deputy, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 345 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special  schools.Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have  access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and  Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service.

These programmes are  offered to students in third level and further education colleges in the public  and private sectors. Students who are citizens from outside the E.U., E.E.A. or  Switzerland, registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, will not  be permitted access to employment unless they are attending a programme  included on the Register. The conditions for inclusion require that the  programme should lead to an award which is nationally recognised in Ireland or  by an awarding body overseas which has a status in law or is otherwise  recognised as having authority to make awards which have national recognition  in their host jurisdiction.While my Department has no function in relation to the operation of private  colleges, if the Deputy wishes to provide details of a specific incident, the  Department will pursue the matter with the  College concerned. Failure by a  College to deal satisfactorily with such a matter would result in an evaluation  of the continued inclusion of its programmes on the Register.Students may also contact the National Consumer Agency, which is a statutory  body established by Government to defend consumer interests and to embed a  robust consumer culture in Ireland.

This Committee is  currently considering the requirements of the Convention and the action  required before ratification can proceed.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1603	I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various  impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even  with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased  borrowing requirement in 2009.In relation to staffing, when the country was able to afford it we reduced the  basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an  average number of primary pupils per teacher from 35 pupils in 1995/96 down to  the current level of 27 pupils. This is reflected in the improvements that we  have made on class sizes over the years and these improvements reflect our  commitment to education. The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher  from September 2009 has to be viewed in that context. Although it reverses some of the progress that we have made in recent years I had no option but to  curtail the annual increase in teacher numbers. The reduced class sizes for the  most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools of an average of 1 teacher for every 20  pupils in Junior classes and an average of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils in  Senior classes are not affected by the Budget decison.While the budget measures will impact on class sizes it will be necessary in  the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and  prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone. While teacher numbers  are important numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that  teacher quality is the single most important factor — far and above anything  else — in improving educational outcomes for children. Ensuring high quality  teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it  represent a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and indeed the teacher unions.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with  the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The  staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence  shortly. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which  schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing  schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.   The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the  redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing  school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.
