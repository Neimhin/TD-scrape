The board's medical adviser has stated that such circumstances have the potential to occur in 5% of transfers due to the downgrading of services at Monaghan General Hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">Regarding No. 15, motion re the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, the law states that the House should decided whether to reactivate sections 2 to 6 having regard to the findings of the Garda report. That provision has been in operation under the Act since 2000. The Garda report was only received at the eleventh hour and it is scanty. It itemises statistics. There is no analysis or correlation of the sets of statistics in relation to a number of very important issues, particularly, with regard to persons charged. The report itself, which is allied to this matter, is meritorious of debate within the House. A very important motion has been brought before us and we would be failing in our duty if we were to adopt it without debate. I appeal for a re-examination of the motion. Members who are familiar with the content of the Garda report will recognise the validity of the points I am making. It is essential that we discuss, debate and analyse exactly what is there.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">It is totally inadequate to provide one hour for this important motion. Effectively, the Government is introducing a mini-budget in respect of motor taxation. It is proposing to allow one hour to raise over €60 million, that is a rate of €1million per minute, from motorists in a mini-budget. Every day we come into the House we are informed of further budgets and cutbacks or increases in charges. The attempt to pass a motion of this nature through this House by stealth and before Christmas is unfair and unjust to motorists who are already contributing €3,600 million to the Exchequer. This is a further imposition which will add to the costs of inflation at a time when Ministers are looking to workers for a wage freeze. This motion deserves proper debate and we do not accept that it should be rammed through in a guillotined motion in an hour.</p>

We have just agreed the guillotine on the previous item and there are five more guillotines. This Government Whip is more fond of the guillotine than Madame Lafarge, so early in the life of a Dáil, that we should have six guillotines lined up today. As Deputy Bruton has said, this measure proposes to raise €60 million in revenue for the Government. The Minister for Finance, on budget day, refused to take it on board and told the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to bring in his own budget. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, is so delighted at being where he is, that he said, "sure, whatever you say, Charlie, I will do it". We are being asked to put through the House in one hour a motion to raise €60 million more from motorists who are already penalised and unable to make their way through our cities and towns. We cannot agree with this, Sir, and I ask the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, to exercise his position and cede some time for a serious discussion on this motion. I do not know how he is ahead of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, but we will talk about that afterwards.</p>

There  are other provisions in the Bill, apart from the social housing provisions, which require detailed consideration by the House, including a new proposal by the Government for the zoning of land at local area plan stage. This is quite a detailed Bill which requires detailed consideration by the House. It is not acceptable that it should be guillotined tomorrow. The Labour Party will oppose such a guillotine.</p>

We should be addressing the issue through the Kenny report and more radical reform of land prices and the provision of houses. The extent of the homelessness problem indicates the poor effort of the Government regarding housing.

          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_235">I am not happy with the extent to which the Minister is providing in this Bill for accountability to this House. This legislation provides that major capital projects envisaged by  many Government Departments will be referred to this agency and that agency will recommend funding packages which may involve public-private partnership. There will be very significant public interest involved in such cases in that projects that would heretofore have been funded on the basis of public funding will now be handed over in considerable measure to the private sector operators. Issues regarding the appropriate use of tolling or pricing will arise as will issues regarding what happens in the event of the private sector project failing, be it a hospital, prison, etc. What happens in the event of the project failing? Where will it end up?</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Significant issues of public interest are wrapped up in the funding packages and contractual obligations of the private sector participants in such projects. The Minister proposes to restrict accountability of this body to the narrow basis of where they got the money and if they spent it efficiently. The issue of efficiency is further circumscribed by the fact that the Minister provides in the legislation that any spokesperson of the agency appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts cannot comment on the hair-brained nature of some of the projects presented to him. We could very well have a situation such as prevailed in the Stadium Ireland project. Everyone knows it was ill-considered and never properly costed. Its benefits were never properly assessed. The Minister admitted on Committee Stage that if such a project were funded by this agency and it had to present itself before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with the efficiency with which it had used money, it need not answer any questions on whether it spent the money prudently.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">What the Minister is proposing is far too restrictive. He does not accept where public projects are funded by private sector money that this House will continue to have a legitimate interest in ensuring these projects are run in a way that protects the public interest. As a result of borrowing restrictions, which the Minister is imposing on his capital budget, more and more Departments will be forced to enter into public private partnerships as the only available route for them to fund some of their projects, and there will not be proper public scrutiny in this House of whether these decisions are being made in an appropriate manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">While the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that his Department would be conducting comparisons between the cost of PPP projects and a simple public borrowing format for running the same projects, he indicated that he would not make available to the House the details of the assessments. The Bill is riddled with provisions to cover up proper procedures of accountability. No doubt the Minister in his reply will say Ministers are responsible and can account. If public private partnerships are to become the source of many thousands of millions of euro of public spending, as the Minister envisages, the process must be  publicly accountable. We must be able to draw comparisons across different projects run under PPPs to ensure public projects are being handled properly and appropriately.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The Minister is introducing the Bill, getting approval from spokesmen on finance, and that will be the last we will hear of it. We have a role to play in regard to holding both the Minister and the agency accountable. As I outlined in my amendments, I would like to see far more accountability and openness in regard to the extent to which agents of this agency account to this House. They should not have unreasonable and unfair restrictions imposed on what they can say to Members of this House who have a legitimate public interest in pursuing these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Minister's approach throughout Committee Stage was extremely disappointing and no progress was made in this regard. The Minister and his colleagues will come back to this House and say they need more vigorous legislators, there should not be a dual mandate, legislators should devote their time to important public issues, yet he is happy to introduce legislation which at every hand's turn denies legislators the opportunity to hold to public account decision makers who make important decisions about the future management of public projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I will press my amendments, which are grouped with the Minister's amendments, because important issues of principle are involved. He must recognise that he is embarking on an experimental route which has not been successful in every instance. There are many cases where PPPs have resulted in more expensive private sector funding for something that could be done cheaply by the public sector. One of the major driving factors behind the Minister's action is undoubtedly the restrictions of the stability pact, which forces him and other Ministers in developing countries to restrict the amount of money they can put into necessary infrastructure. We are being forced down this road by inflexible rules agreed regarding the stability pact. The Minister would have a better opportunity to seek amendments in Europe to the stability pact rules rather than put us into this straitjacket whereby, if we exceed 1% public borrowing for capital purposes, we will be forced into this PPP route and have to try to take projects off balance sheet without proper accountability in respect of such funding. I must continue to hold the line that the Minister's approach does not provide adequate accountability for a new and important approach, which has potential in certain instances, but could go wrong in other cases.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_242">I made the point on Committee Stage, which I repeat again, that the new agency, which will cost a good few million euro per year, is entirely superfluous. All the work of the agency could be subsumed perfectly well within the National Treasury Management Agency and the amendments the Minister has tabled prove that point. He has already trumpeted the fact that  SPC companies and other projects will not be subject to State guarantee. The Minister, presumably acting on advice from the NTMA which would be trying to get the cheapest rate for State projects, has reconsidered and there is now provision for guarantees. This is a major climbdown and U-turn, which proves the agency was a Fianna Fáil election promise.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">While circumstances have changed, it was designed to get certain Irish projects off balance sheet and not reported in terms of the stability pact. These conditions are now changing. The agency is an example of how the Government in six years allowed public expenditure in certain areas to spiral out of control, with no benefit to taxpayers. There has been the setting up of board after board, agency after agency, consulting group after consulting group, all of which have taken their cut off the backs of taxpayers. This is another device to cost taxpayers more money in respect of a function which can be more than adequately carried out within the existing State structure and organisation, particularly that of the NTMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I said already that I am dissatisfied with the reporting mechanisms which have been arranged. This body, which will oversee and advise on the spending of billions of euro of taxpayers' money and PPP money will be, in effect, hidden from public scrutiny. The only device available to scrutinise the process will be the annual accounts six months after the end of the year. The West Link toll bridge is the best example to date of a public private partnership where the vast bulk of the profits have gone to the private sector and unfortunate tollpayers in the greater Dublin area have paid for the largest traffic jam in Europe. In future if projects are conducted through the mechanism of this agency, as the Minister proposes, it will not be possible to ask sensible questions or seek reasonable information and accountability, which the Dáil should be capable of exercising in regard to the spending and commitment of taxpayers' money. The reintroduction in the Bill of the notion of the State as the guarantor of last resort, on which the Minister did a U-turn, means that if the public private partnership project fails, the State will have to pick up the tab. The notion of transferring the risk from the State to the private sector in respect of a public amenity like a hospital, school or stretch of road is nonsensical because, if the public private partnership project fails, the State cannot close down the school, hospital or road.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The Minister's amendment represents a climbdown. It recognises and acknowledges that the State must be, in effect, the guarantor of last resort. Why is it necessary to create a separate agency to perform functions that could be done by existing bodies?</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The Bill removes from committees of the Oireachtas the regular and reasonable power of scrutiny and the opportunity to hear the advice that members of the board have proffered to Ministers about the suitability of certain projects  and financial structures. A vast amount of public money has been spent on consultancy for the Abbotstown project in my constituency. All we have to show for the taxpayers' money that has been spent is a swimming pool which has cost about three times what it might have cost as a direct project. I know the problems with the Abbotstown development can be attributed in part to inter-party squabbling within the Government about its merits, but the cost in terms of money lost to the public purse is astonishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I welcome the swimming pool that has been constructed, but nothing else has been built on the site and millions of euro have been wasted. The limited Oireachtas scrutiny the Abbotstown project has received will be almost impossible in future cases if this Bill is passed and Members of the House will have to engage in a form of parliamentary or accounting archaeology to uncover what happened. It will be almost irrelevant as the money will have been spent and infrastructural opportunities may have disappeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The Minister for Finance is well known for being averse to receiving advice. The agency established in this legislation was a Fianna Fáil election promise and taxpayers will have to fund it to soothe the Minister's vanity. I retain the opinion I expressed on other Stages of this Bill, that it contains deep flaws. I welcome, however, the fact that the Minister's amendment reasserts the primary control of the National Treasury Management Agency over the functions of the National Development Finance Agency. Certain advisory decisions will be difficult for Ministers to resist when they are desperately anxious to commence a project such as a school, hospital or road. Could Ministers resist the opportunity to get some or all of their Departments' capital projects off the ground? The Dáil will not be allowed to carry out public scrutiny of the comparative costs and efficiency of the projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">It will be a bad day's work if we allow this Bill to pass. While I do not think we will encounter many examples of projects not going ahead, as Ministers and communities will be anxious for projects to proceed and offers to construct schools, hospitals or roads under PPP schemes will therefore not be rejected, society will have to fund the consequences of such schemes over a 25 year period. As we know, taxpayers will be the ultimate guarantor in most cases as it is not possible for risk to be transferred entirely from the State to private projects. It is mumbo-jumbo economics to suggest that it is possible and it recalls the thinking that was popularised in New Zealand in the 1970s and 1980s. Many senior public servants studied the New Zealand model and I wish they would go there now to see the ultimate consequences of the policies of that time. It is as bad for Ireland to adopt this deeply flawed model now as it would be for us to accept the economic ideas of Reagan or Thatcher almost 20 years after they were abandoned elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I retain my objections to the Minister's amendments, as I outlined on Committee Stage. I regret that he has not seen fit to rethink this matter, especially in the context of changes in the conditions governing the stability pact. The Commission and the European Union are correctly rethinking the terms of the stability pact as they apply to necessary infrastructure in the member states. Eurostat, which will judge how the projects will be treated for national accounting purposes, has made clear that it will prioritise substance over form. If the State is investing in a public good, Eurostat will probably include it in our national accounts, regardless of the off-balance sheet structures attempted by the Minister. I do not know what the Minister will gain from this legislation other than the vanity of keeping an election promise which is now redundant.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">In the run-up to the budget, the Minister acknowledged that an additional €75 million will have to be spent on the SSIA scheme to allow him to boost it. The Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children are white-faced as a result of the decreases in funding made available for essential services in their Departments. The Minister for Finance, however, is content to spend €75 million on the SSIA scheme next year and a total of €300 million over the life of the scheme. Similarly, the agency being established in this Bill is largely redundant. It will cost the taxpayer money while reducing the capacity of this House, the public and the media to critically analyse what is happening in relation to necessary national projects.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_252">I agree with Deputies Bruton and Burton, as it is superfluous either on Committee or Report Stage to seek to amend a Bill to create a flawed and unnecessary agency. It calls into question some of the reasons we are in this House. It is right, however, that we should discuss the amendments before the House. Amendment No. 2, in the name of the Minister for Finance, reveals the ludicrous nature of this Bill and the agency it seeks to create. The Minister is attempting to provide that the agency will be accountable, in so far as it will be accountable at all, to the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member. I cannot attend this morning's meeting of the committee, however, as I am unable to practise bilocation. It is typical of the way in which the business of the House is organised. When important legislation such as this Bill is debated, we often refer to giving committees an advisory role, but there is no point in doing so if a committee is sitting while the House is discussing a related Bill. We should ensure that Members are able to contribute to all debates in which they have an interest as we consider the future organisation of the business of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The proposal before the House is far from adequate, as it seems to underline the original proposals in the Bill. It seems that the agency is being established to operate apart from the busi ness of the House and, as far as possible, from the business of the Department of Finance. Such a provision is a throwback to the culture of secrecy that has dogged Ireland's political maturity and development. As my party's finance spokesman I am not happy with the provision and my party is not willing to support it in the House. As other Opposition speakers have said, committees of the House should, as a matter of course, contribute to, examine and oversee public private partnerships that relate to capital projects in the Department relevant to the committee. The Green Party believes that PPPs are a fraud, as while they might assist the fast-tracking of infrastructure, the overall cost to the taxpayer will be higher. Public private partnerships are riddled with risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The establishment of this agency and the provisions in relation to the State, through the agency, acting as a guarantor and in effect becoming a lender of last resort to private enterprise underlines the poverty behind the Bill. We know that the present method of putting in place public infrastructure through public sector borrowing has its flaws but if legislation was needed it should have been in the area of public procurement improvements. The Minister should look at the idea that many of these projects have cost overruns because of provisions in the contracts that do not encourage the contractors to achieve value for money, the whole idea of <i>ad valorem</i> payments for contractors, professions, architects and engineers, the idea of a percentage of the overall cost rather than a set price, the fact that there are no penalty clauses in many contracts and so on. That is the road he should have gone down and still should go down. Nothing speaks louder of that failure than the indications that the National Development Plan will deliver one-third of the suggested projects for 50% of the projected costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I attended an event last Monday in Cork University Hospital where the Minister for Health and Children, who seems to be entangled, either publicly or privately, with the Minister for Finance over the very projects which we are debating, was talking about how his Department was more in line than other Departments to meet the initial National Development Plan costs for capital projects. He was able to make this boast by being merely 15% over budget. If the best Department is 15% over budget it says a lot about the accounting procedures within the Department of Finance and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Regarding the scrutiny suggested by the Bill, through the Committee of Public Accounts, the committee already has an enormous workload and we have a very efficient and well-informed Comptroller and Auditor General. There is still a great deal of uncertainty that providing the agencies' accounts will reveal the full picture. Will they be consolidated accounts? Will they take account of the myriad of companies that can and will be formed by the agency? I suspect not and,  if they do, they will come in a drip-feed fashion so that we will never see, at any one time, the work of the agency as a snapshot of the amount of money that it spends on the public's behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">In general terms, the idea that the agency can form these companies is a further illustration of the Minister's intention to engage in what has been referred to as "off balance sheet accounting". We should not go down this road for reasons of accountability and, more importantly, because of the likelihood that public finances will get further out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The Minister's amendment should be rejected on all of these grounds and the amendments suggested by other Opposition spokespersons should be accepted, especially in the area of the Freedom of Information Act. I am surprised to hear that the value-for-money comparisons that the Department will make against public private partnerships will not be included for public inspection at the earliest possible opportunity. As a result it will be left to the Comptroller and Auditor General to do subsequent audits which will show that many of these comparisons were erroneous and cost the State money. This is unnecessary and is a road we should not go down.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">It is likely that, because of the cloak-and-dagger secrecy involved, what Deputy Bruton mentioned about EUROSTAT will come to pass. The attempt to avoid calling this borrowing, which it is, will be exposed and stated as such by EUROSTAT. The Minister has already had the experience of trying a budgetary measure in last year's budget and that bluff was called. It ill-serves the use of the House's time to introduce legislation which will not have its intended effect and will be exposed as an attempt to obscure the reality of public finances in this country.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_210" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I oppose the amendments tabled by Deputies Burton and Bruton. It is not a matter for the boards of the NDFA to report to a committee of the Oireachtas on a project, or projects, which it funds. It will be a matter for the relevant Minister, accounting officer or equivalent to report to the Government and the Oireachtas in the normal manner, in keeping with existing democratic accountability arrangements. I consider that the requirement of section 18(6) for the chairman and chief executive of NDFA to give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts, whenever so required, provides for sufficient accountability by the agency for reforms of it functions. I do not consider it appropriate that the chairman or chief executive of the NDFA should express views on Government policy when appearing before the committee. There are similar provisions to this in other legislation such as the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Competition Act, 2002. I gave a list of those acts on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The objectives of the NDFA is to ensure that the private sector does not profit unduly from PPPs. Centralisation of financial expertise in the NDFA will ensure that only the best, or optimal,  finance projects are accepted. That is the purpose of setting up the NDFA, to ensure that the State can provide the optimal financial arrangements for PPPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Section 20 sets out detailed provisions on what the accounts of the agency should contain. These include the items mentioned by Deputy Boyle. Returning to what the Deputy raised about EUROSTAT, every year EUROSTAT excludes, includes or recasts items in Governments' accounts. It happens all of the time, with all countries. To my knowledge, recently Italy and Portugal have had some of their items excluded. There is nothing unusual in EUROSTAT deciding earlier this year not to allow the items referred to concerning the Central Bank against the general Government balance. This goes on all the time and will continue to do so. Even items from next year's figures are subject to the same type of scrutiny. There is nothing unusual in that, it is what EUROSTAT does all the time with all countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">There seems to be confusion, deliberate or otherwise, on the part of some Opposition spokespersons regarding the Stability and Growth Pact. When we put forward the idea of the National Development Finance Agency in the last general election I gave examples for the next five years of the possibilities regarding moneys raised by the NDFA. These moneys would be outside the Exchequer borrowing requirement. Depending on the type of project, it might count against the Government's general balance. I gave examples in the statistics, going forward for five years, time and time again in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto launch and at various press conferences. I said if €2 billion were raised by the NDFA over the next five years it would count to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement but I gave the example that perhaps only 50% would count against the general Government balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">If Deputy Boyle looks at the documentation he will see €2 billion on the top line and below it, €1 billion in taxes which come back to the general Government balance in order to give the figure for that balance. This is what enthralled the people for the first ten days of the election campaign, when we kept talking about the economy and the figures for next year. Those figures also showed that expenditure increases would be of a moderate amount, although after the election, when I began to implement that policy, that seemed to come as a surprise. We certainly spent the first ten days of the election campaign speaking of nothing except the economy. There were great debates between me and the Opposition spokespersons about who had the correct figures, but they were all there. It should not have been a surprise to anybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">It is quite clear that the activities of the NDFA will be outside Exchequer borrowing requirements but, depending on the project, may or may not be within the general Government balance. The EUROSTAT rulings on these matters will not occur before the event but after it. In simple terms, the more remote the project will be from  the Government, the more likely it is that it will be outside both the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the general Government balance. The nearer it is to the Government, the less likely it is to be counted off the general Government balance. It really depends on the transfer of risk. If the risk is wholly transferred, for example for a toll road with no recourse to the Government, it will be off the EBR and off the general Government balance. If there is recourse to the Government, it will be off the EBR but likely to count against the general Government balance. EUROSTAT will make those rulings after the event.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I tried to explain the question of borrowing on Committee Stage, but obviously not to great effect. After the start of the year, Departments must stick with the Government's decision on borrowing requirements. If we decide that a certain amount is to be done by the NDFA, that will be part of the overall borrowing or capital requirements for that year. Departments will not be able to go off, pick up projects and send them off to the NDFA, because that would cause difficulties for me. If the project counted against the general Government balance that would be outside the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. Departments will not be able to send a project off to the NDFA and forget about it, thinking it will not count against the general Government balance requirements – depending on the project, it may count against the balance and be subject to the rules regarding the capital requirements for Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I will hardly be able to convince the Opposition of the merits of the NDFA in this limited time, but in time it will be a useful tool to the Government in assessing financial packages. We discussed this on Committee Stage. The agency will provide advice regarding optimal financing. It will not give views on whether the project is a good or a bad one. The object of this agency is to deal with money – finding the best possible financial arrangement. I gave some examples of public private partnerships – if the NDFA had been there when these were being set up it could have offered a better way of financing them, resulting in a far better package in terms of money. It will deal with bonds and so on. In PPPs, the project operator must bring in the finances and it will always cost more than the State can borrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Most people in the House – with the exception of Deputy Burton and her party – believe that PPPs have other advantages such as efficiency, speed of delivery and so on. There will also be failures, of course. There are failures everywhere this approach is used, but there are also many successes. We have tried to learn from the successes and failures of other countries, noting their mistakes and trying not to repeat them. This agency is concerned only with financing arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The proposition was put forward that the NDFA could be an adjunct of the National Treas ury Management Agency. Although it will be closely allied to the NTMA, the function of the latter is to manage the national debt, while the NDFA will be concerned with providing finance for capital projects, a totally different matter. They are somewhat related, but it would not be possible for us to have one agency doing these two jobs. I have given other functions to the NTMA, such as its role in the national pensions reserve fund – it is the first manager. I have also set up the State Claims Agency, which works in conjunction with the NTMA, and the NDFA will also work in conjunction with it. The chairman of the NDFA will be the chief executive officer of the NTMA and they will work closely together. I am convinced that this will be a good agency. We will be able to see in three or four years whether it has been effective. I believe that it will be, and it should be given a chance.</p>

          <p eId="para_270">I admire the Minister's conviction. A test of his conviction would be to allow the House to participate in deciding whether this agency is a success. If he decides, for example, to build a new hospital and puts it out to a private contractor, this House will have a legitimate interest in knowing whether it ended up being cheaper than a public project and whether it respects the public policy requirements of a public hospital to care properly and fairly for its patients. If the financial package put together by the agency results in the project being more expensive or results in charges being imposed on public patients, for whom we want to provide free care, this House will want to know that. We will also want to know if the agency insists on the project being funded from certain sources not in accord with public policy.</p>

We want the Minister to make this public information, available to Members. He is refusing to do this. That is the first vital piece of evidence this House will  want so that it can make judgments. The Minister is confident that he will be proven right, so why not give us that evidence and let us agree that the Minister for Finance was right and that we, the sceptics, were wrong?</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_278">I sometimes despair, in a friendly way, of the capacity of the Minister for Finance for listening to advice. The Minister said the last day, in his introduction to the Bill, that Departments will be required to seek the advice of this agency. There are young students in the Gallery. If their school needs an extension or their town needs a hospital or their area needs a road, they will be so anxious to secure that investment in infrastructure that no one can realistically ask them to be concerned about the method of financing and its cost. They will want the investment to go ahead but the taxpayer will have to pick up the tab if and when the NDFA gets it wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">There is one outstanding example of a public private partnership in this State, the Westlink toll bridge. All profits from the toll bridge have been made by the private sector while the cost to the public in tolls and traffic jams is extraordinarily high. Neither the public nor this House has any way to force a change to this fiasco in traffic management in Dublin. It goes to the heart of the reservations about the mechanism the Minister has chosen. It is another agency that will cost a lot of money and which is entirely superfluous. We need input over and above the National Treasury Management Agency, which has great expertise and has used it wisely, into project management and project delivery. This agency will not do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I asked the Minister, in the context of the partnership structure, to allow a representative from ICTU and the employers' organisations to be part of the agency's board so they could express social concerns to help the board to reach its decisions and I am disappointed that the Minister has refused that request.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">The Minister is philosophically driven in his politics, an admirable quality, but he ignores the central philosophy behind many public private partnerships, whereby essential public services will now be provided on a profit driven basis. An existing gymnasium in a school in Bal lincollig, County Cork, is being knocked down to be replaced by a new facility which will then be hired out by its owner, Jarvis PLC, on a commercial basis and to the detriment of community services. This Bill and the agency it establishes will multiply that effect and will undermine social and community services while imposing additional costs on the Exchequer and the taxpayer. That is a high price to pay for a political philosophy. I ask the Minister to accept the proposed amendments and take time to consider further this badly thought out Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">Many people would have to be consulted under the guidelines and Deputy  Bruton raised valid points about how these guidelines will meet EU requirements. We will have to wait and see what happens. The Attorney General will have to have an input into the guidelines but it all comes back to the fundamental issue of transparency. Only if transparent information is available will it be possible to judge if this approach will constitute real value for money over the 25 year period of these projects. Earlier Fianna Fáil Administrations built low cost housing in parts of Dublin that turned out to be the most expensive housing for local authorities to maintain. Sometimes the cheapest and most attractive option is not the best.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Deputy Boyle mentioned Jarvis PLC and its contract to build schools. The Minister, on Committee Stage, rightly said that school principals are thrilled about this. Of course they are. They are thrilled they are no longer on the telephone to Tullamore and someone is now building the school. Why would they look a gift horse in the mouth? The principals, however, do not have the job of looking at the overall balance sheet in terms of the gains to the public compared with the losses under this system. We have already heard about the huge problems in Britain in school buildings constructed by Jarvis PLC, the disastrous problems with its maintenance contracts and the tragic consequences of its involvement in transport in London. That has still not been sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">As a result, surveys by the ACCA in Britain have shown that the balance of opinion among experienced accountants has shifted away from the glorification of PFI. This is a copy of that system and sensible voices are saying that it is not the cheap, value for money solution that people thought when it first became fashionable.</p>

This agency will have access to sensitive information of a commercial nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">We have too often seen the lack of guidelines within the Civil Service which allow people to go from prominent local government positions to positions in the private sector and, what is more worrying, allow those involved in important public sector projects on behalf of national Government to go a similar route. An agency is being set up and peopled with those who will have information that can subsequently be used for personal benefit and this is not addressed in the legislation. To be promised future guidelines that may or may not address the problem is something the House should not stand for or approve.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">There was considerable discussion of this issue on Committee Stage and it is important the House consider it. The issue is whether the function of this new agency be extended to effectively offer a management service to the national pension fund whereby the pension fund could put money into infrastructure projects that would yield a return. The Minister is determined not to amend the national pension fund legislation, which is his prerogative. This does not seek to amend that legislation or to impose on that fund any obligation to consider public projects for their investment, much though I would like to see a requirement in that regard. The amendment simply requires that the agency take the opportunity, and have as a specific function the delivery to the national pension fund of suitable packages that would attract resources for which the taxpayer is already paying.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The background to this is that the taxpayer is this year borrowing €1.5 billion to devote to the pension fund, which in turn invests that money on foreign stock exchanges at a time when our infrastructure is groaning under the weight of congestion. This situation does not make sense and, much though the Minister might want to avoid putting pressure on the pension fund, it ought to be encouraged in the small way proposed to give greater consideration to public infrastructure projects that can yield a return.  This is a sensible proposal and does not undermine the freedom of operation of the pension fund which the Minister is determined to protect. It is to ensure that the tolls motorists pay on roads will not go solely to line the pockets of private sector providers but may well go to fund their future pension commitments. It would be a happy concurrence of events if that could be achieved and I hope the Minister will at least facilitate the new agency in encouraging the pension fund to go down this road.</p>

          <p eId="para_308">There was considerable debate in drawing up the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act in both the Department and the House as to the best way to do it. I decided the best way was to have the functions of the Act the same as any ordinary pension fund; that is, to get the optimum return. The commissioners must act prudently as trustees of pension funds do. That is the road I have decided to travel and it is as far away as is legally possible from the Minister for Finance. I do not influence the fund or anything else and that is deliberate. My instructions to my officials were to ensure the Act did not have any piece in it—</p>

          <p eId="para_315">I was explaining what the fund does. There is always a temptation to ensure that the Minister for Finance has some recourse to change the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act.  I deliberately decided that the Act would ensure that the Minister for Finance has no role with the pensions fund commissioners, despite the temptation for the Minister for Finance in particular to have that kind of residual power in the event of a very rainy day. The legislation underpinning the national pensions reserve fund is as far away from the maws of Government as it is legally possible to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I have had recent advice from the Opposition that perhaps this year – temporarily of course – I should reduce the 1% GNP contribution. Even the most naive Deputies will know that if it was reduced once, it would always be. One would never get back to putting in the 1% because there would always be an excuse not to do it. Ministers would push for more spending in particular areas; the Opposition would demand more spending in other areas as would outside groups, and it would not be possible to get back to putting in the 1%. The most naive politicians should know that.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Even the 1% of GNP, which under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act must go into the fund each year, will not be enough to meet the problems of an ageing population in the years ahead. Deputies may have read in recent days the report received by the European Commission on ageing and how it will affect all types of economic activity in a few short years. Those who read the <i>Financial Times</i> will have seen the report two days ago stating that this will be a drain on resources for years to come and which asked how it is to be funded. A sum of 1% is to be set aside for the national pensions fund and a kick-start given to it with the substantial amount of money that came from the privatisation of Telecom Éireann. However, it was estimated that that money would only mean about 30% of the additional cost in 25 to 50 years time.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Provision for pensions is as real a liability as the electricity bill for this House; it is occurring as we speak and it was decided for good reasons to establish the pensions reserve fund to meet the liability that is certain to be there in years to come. Europe has looked at the problem of how to fund pensions as have we. The 1% set aside each year will not meet the additional cost in years to come though it will ease it.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Many people have mentioned the high costs that come with an ageing population but the recent report to the Commission looks at this from another angle also. It says that the ageing of the population will lessen growth in the European Union in coming years. It compares Europe unfavourably with the United States which, it states, has a more open immigration policy.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_321">There are different angles to it. The report highlights that one of the reasons the United States is growing is that younger people are going to the United States. That compares unfavourably with Europe. We will not only have  the costs associated with pensions, but there will be lower growth in Europe over the next 20 years to fund pensions and everything else. We have been complimented for having the foresight to do something. However, it is not the only way to address this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The European Commission is pushing to increase the retirement age because people, who have better health nowadays, must be kept working to ensure greater economic activity. The European Commission has been examining this issue for some time. The retirement age will probably be increased. We are out of step in that regard because we have always considered earlier retirement. The rest of Europe and the Commission is considering increasing the retirement age.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Our approach in setting up the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act is a way of addressing part of the problem. We should try to keep it going for a few years without politicians interfering and taking money out of it. The people would respond badly if a Minister or Government said it was going to take money from people's pensions. Despite all the negative publicity about the Bill both inside and outside the House, surveys done prior to the election showed that the people supported the pension fund. Why? They did so because they are sensible and they know that we should provide for the future when things are going well. The Government is doing the right thing in putting money aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">As regards the amendment, there is nothing to prevent the pension fund commissioners from investing in infrastructural projects. They are likely to do so if they get a good rate of return. If there are attractive options, they will get a good rate of return, subject to normal prudent arrangements. However, I will not issue a specific requirement. I oppose the amendment. I am glad of the opportunity to once again put on the record of the House the benefits of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_325">I would have listened with respect to the Minister's lecture on his genius if he was not the same Minister who last year raided the social insurance fund to the tune of several hundred million euro and who refused, together with his Government, to give workers who were made redundant a decent redundancy payment from the funds to which they contributed. If the Minister believes in the funding and contributory principle, then he should not have raided the social insurance fund last year and people who became redundant should not have been refused a decent level of redundancy payment from the funds to which they contributed. The principles of funding contributions and mutuality do not require less than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">There is a fundamental error in the Minister's philosophy on the national pensions reserve fund, which can be attributed to his ideology. He always likens the country and our society to a  small family company. While one might argue that the directors and family members would be well advised to create a pension scheme – I am sure the Minister, as an accountant, has advised people to do that on many occasions – it is wrong to compare a society and an economy with a small private company and to use that as the model for everything we do in terms of our national finances and society's needs. That is one of the reasons, despite our recent affluence, we have fallen short of the mark in terms of providing the necessary infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The public is rightly attached to the notion of providing for themselves in the future. However, the people do not yet realise – I am sure the Minister's spin doctors and his lack of transparency have kept it from them – that much of the money in the national pensions reserve fund will be used to fatten the commission fees of brokers and advisers across the world. We do not have a proper road and rail infrastructure and much of our hospital infrastructure is a disgrace. We, as a society, not as a small private family firm which telephones an insurance company for a deal on a policy, are looking at a massive infrastructural deficit, yet we are paying people in stockbroking houses, who are perfectly happy to boost the Minister's vanity, fat fees to invest borrowings and our hard earned money in the infrastructure of Hong Kong, New York and anywhere else from here to Timbuctoo.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">When the national pensions reserve fund laid its first annual report before the House in the middle of the year, which covered the 12 months to last December, it showed that because of falling equity markets around the world the initial investments from the Eircom sell-off and the subsequent national contribution had lost significant elements of their capital value. The Minister should not tell me it is a 25 year timescale. It is like Senator O'Rourke's small print on the Eircom offer that the value of a share may rise and fall. We know the Minister's belief that the value of equity investments may rise over a 25 year period. However, that is not the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">This country has an incredible infrastructural deficit. The chamber of commerce said that it takes longer to transport goods in the greater Dublin area than in almost any other developed capital in the world. The American Chamber of Commerce, which the Minister's friend, Deputy Harney, addressed at its Christmas lunch, struck a strong warning note about our infrastructural deficit. Like Deputy Glennon, I represent an area where there is a significant amount of foreign direct investment. The chief executives of those companies are seriously concerned at the infrastructural deficits in a number of areas. The Minister is defending himself. He mentioned the problem of controlling the cost of capital projects and he said that if he released more money, the cost would rise. Perhaps he should talk to his friends in Fianna Fáil or to the contributors in the tent in Ballybrit about how they should control their costs. That is the problem. We are putting money  into funds abroad when we have a significant infrastructural deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The Minister argued about saving for future pension liabilities and alluded to the economy of the United States. The Friedman-Reagan years did immense damage to the American economy, which is now acknowledged by all sides there. That damage was the result of following absolutely the free market theory. The USA's economy is sustained by net population increases including immigration growth. The Minister's comments moments ago in regard to the importance of maintaining a young population and a net inflow of people reflect something that is vital to the European economy given that the population is ageing. Sustaining a young, trained work force is essential to sustaining investment and competitiveness. I wish the Minister would pass that on to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">We are turning our backs on some of our oldest traditions and notions of society in order to close the door on anyone who wishes to come here. I welcome the Minister's remarks in regard to the economic success of the United States of America's use of appropriate immigration policies, such as the green card lottery, to meet labour shortages. It has pursued that sensible policy since its origins. The remarks show that somebody in the Government has a little sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I accept the Minister's point that technically the commissioners of the fund are at liberty to invest it where they see fit. However, those appointees have no stakeholder interest or reporting requirements. They are individuals selected by the Minister, largely on the basis of experience in capital markets, but their objectives are those of a private fund management over a 25 year period. They have no commitment to growing the economy. There is another point of view about pension provision in an economy which looks at it from the perspective of the social insurance fund principle. It is by growing the economy that you provide for the 25 year olds who 25 years hence will be at an age when they are looking to pension funds. That is how it is done by a society rather than by use of the small private company model which the Minister has chosen. In the polls it conducted before the election, Fianna Fáil found that people liked the idea of saving for the future, which is natural. However, they will not be very forgiving when they realise they have no public transport, public infrastructure is in a mess and hospitals resemble some I have seen in Africa. Visiting some of our hospitals at the weekend makes one feel ashamed, despite the very fine staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">This is the richest period of our lives but because of our infrastructural problems everything is being done on the basis of public private partnerships. The Minister should think again in a social context of society's needs. Growing our infrastructure will produce a significant economic return which, in turn, will sustain foreign direct investment and local investment. I laud the Mini ster for wishing to provide people with pensions, but to do it he must grow and sustain the economy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_334">The Minister's intransigence on this issue, while typical, represents one of his least endearing qualities. The sermon he has just delivered ignores several salient facts which do not suit his need to convince himself of the rightness of his policy. The demographic time-bomb is likely to hit Ireland several decades after it hits the rest of Europe, but for now we have significant demographic advantages which we should be building on and encouraging to help meet future needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The concept of a national pension fund is not opposed. The argument has been the extent to which it is added to every year and in what circumstances. Given current budgetary circumstances, some of us have argued that the annual increment should be <i>pro rata.</i> It is nonsense to say you can put in the same percentage of GNP when the rate of growth in the economy is one-fifth what it was at its height. These are the mechanisms which should be put in place if we are serious about prudent economic management.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The fact that we are adding to a fund which has become depleted already because of investment decisions is something this House is concerned about. Whatever assurances the Minister gives that whatever is invested in equities will recover, there is no degree of certainty. We may find that having made these large contributions annually the fund we created is much less than the sum of the annual increments. It is not a good use of public resources. The Minister is probably aware that we were preceded in this policy by Norway where the existence of a sinking fund became an election issue during the last campaign. The coalition which succeeded in that election convinced the electorate that sinking fund was available to meet short-term electoral considerations. The Minister should not think, therefore, that the fund is ringfenced and protected in perpetuity from future political change. The fund's existence will be a temptation.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">I agree fully with the central point of the amendment. I cannot understand why the money within the national pension fund cannot be used to finance roads infrastructure. Why is it that the return which accrued to National Toll Roads from the West Link cannot accrue to the national pension fund? If we insist that the fund should invest in equity, why are we turning up our noses at potential investments worth ten times the original sum put in? Deputy Bruton's suggestion seems to be the height of common sense and logic. However, I understand that logic does not form the basis of the financial and economic policies of this Government. I urge the Minister to consider this matter even to the extent that an amendment of the original pension fund legislation is required.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">With this amendment I ask the Minister to take a baby step in terms of providing a modicum of accountability to the House. The Minister and his colleagues continually urge Deputies to devote their energies to legislative work instead of bothering ourselves about mending potholes. I presume the Minister will follow the logic of that. From our session during the week, he will be aware that the finance committee is very interested in seeing the policy guidelines he will be issuing to the agency. He should therefore give the Oireachtas the opportunity to do what he and his colleagues say we do best, to hold to account the implementation of Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I ask the Minister to make a small gesture towards democracy by allowing the guidelines, which he is taking on himself the right to make, to be presented before an Oireachtas committee which he has already attended and where they would be given a spirited assessment. The guidelines would be the better for that and the agency would be the better for having the opportunity to study the transcripts of the discussion on the guidelines at committee.</p>

For that reason I have no difficulty in submitting the requisite number of copies of the final version of the guidelines to the Oireachtas Library.

          <p eId="para_344">I hoped the Minister would have had second thoughts on this amendment. The mechanism of the agency will be desperately important to a range of institutions and Government Departments in seeking funding for projects. The Minister is requiring Departments and projects to seek the advice of the agency. He said in his initial speech that it would be compulsory to seek the advice of the agency. It is important, therefore, that the House has an opportunity to  examine the guidelines. The Minister has been at pains to suggest that the advice of the agency will be entirely in relation to financial packaging but I suspect the structure of the guidelines will, effectively, offer the mechanism and structure by which projects will be pitched. All of us are concerned that the guidelines would be genuine and allow for flexibility and the maximum benefit to the public and the taxpayer. However, in view of the way the Minister is going about it, I fear we will get a straitjacket. For that reason it is important that the guidelines be available for debate by the House and the appropriate committee.</p>

It would go a long way towards addressing a concern I have already expressed on Report State in relation to members of the agency subsequently finding themselves working in the private sector with possible access to information gained within the agency. It is important that such guidelines are put in place and that the House has the maximum involvement in helping to shape, amend and review them. I hope the Minister will reconsider his reluctance to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">I am often bewildered by the attitude of the Minister. This is the minimal level of accountability we could be expected to accept. We are setting up a new agency to do something entirely new in relation to how we handle public projects and the Minister will not allow a provision whereby, before making or changing the guidelines, he would be required to come before a committee and the House could, by motion, seek to amend those guidelines if it so wished. This is a very low test of accountability to which the Minister is being asked to agree. I am concerned about the agency given that the Minister is adamant it will not be accountable in any real sense to the Oireachtas. This undermines my confidence in an agency in which I still have some hope, albeit less than that of the Minister, that it can be of some value, and I am concerned that the Minister wants to protect it from this minimal level of accountability to the specialist committee of the House which has an interest in these matters. To say he will send us a pack containing his guidelines or that he will place them in the Oireachtas Library is different from saying he will come before a committee, be held accountable, and allow the House, if it deems fit, to table a motion seeking modification of those guidelines. That is the minimum we should expect from a Minister under the Constitution of a Republic.</p>

Previously the accounting officer would have been responsible for the project from beginning to end but now that responsibility would be diluted considerably because of the nature of the funding packages to be developed by the agency. It is likely that these important issues will fall between the two stools. Real issues, such as the nature and use of public policy pricing, and the provisions made in the event of the commercial failure of a project, are likely to be forgotten and downplayed in the headlong rush to get money from some source when the conventional route is not available. It is a pity the Minister cannot see when creating this two-pronged approach, that he needs to provide this type of protection to ensure the important public issues do not fall between the two stools.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">In page 8, line 34, after "members" to insert "one of whom shall be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and one of whom shall be nominated by bodies representing employers".</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I ask the Minister to reconsider this. I spoke already about it in the context of the partnership arrangements to which this Government is so  committed. It is important that the social partners and stakeholders in society should have a role on the board of this agency. The agency will be in a pivotal position in regard to deciding on key public infrastructural projects. Projects must be referred to it for advice in regard, essentially, to the financial package. In essence, this agency, together with the National Treasury Management Agency, will have a pivotal role in saying "yea" or "nay" to important public infrastructural projects. Therefore, the social partners should be represented in some capacity on the board of the agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The board is small and the Minister wants to keep it tight. I have looked at the membership of the board of the National Pension Reserve Fund whose members were chosen for their financial and technical expertise. Because of that, they are investing our money in the infrastructure of countries from here to Hong Kong and to Timbuktu. That is great for Hong Kong, Singapore and the Asia Pacific area which is getting 6% of the annual contribution. The United States is getting 20% of it and the European Union area, over and beyond the Republic of Ireland, is getting 40%.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I want members on the board who are socially accountable to Irish society. I have said before that the Minister tries to run the economy as if it was a small private company. As we all know, small private companies can go into liquidation. The Irish economy and people cannot afford that. We cannot afford the kind of ideological straitjacket the Minister is creating in regard to our necessary infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">It is a comment on the restrictions and limitations of the social partnership model that the social partners have been unable to contribute to the debate in regard to this agency. I ask the Minister to consider this, in light of the commitments the Taoiseach has made time and again to the concept of social partnership, and in the context of the Minister himself arguing that it was the social partners who endorsed the public private partnership model. The projects the social partnership model identify as necessary to the future and sustainability of our economy will go through this agency. As it is often the person who holds the financial purse strings who will have the final "yea" or "nay" on the project it is appropriate that the people on the board should be people with expertise. That should not be just financial expertise but the people chosen should have a commitment to the wider concept of Irish society and to the interests of the various stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">In the Minister's reply to my question the other day in regard to the membership of the board of the Central Bank, he pointed out that he appointed to that board members and representatives of various groups representing different streams in society. Unfortunately, he was not in a position to appoint a woman among those ten people. He argued that the Central Bank was an important board with important work to do.  Clearly, women did not come within the ambit of that kind of important work. Nonetheless, the Minister accepted the principle that fairly wide sectors of society should be represented on the Central Bank board, even if they are all men.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">This argument applies even more in the case of this board. Board members, even if they are representative of wider interests in society such as the trade union movement, the social pillar or the employers' organisations, should also be people of appropriate technical expertise. It goes without saying they should have the qualifications and attributes necessary to be on the board. This would ensure that decisions made by the agency are not narrow financial decisions but are made considering the wider needs of society and the economy. It is also relevant that these people would have a sense of responsibility to those interests they represent. This, in turn, would increase the accountability that is, unfortunately, absent from the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">We dealt with this at considerable length on Committee Stage and I do not wish to go over that ground again. I did not suggest or imply that the work of the Central Bank was so important that it could only be left to men. Even Deputy Bruton is laughing at that.

          <p eId="para_381">While I see the merit in Deputy Burton's amendment, the point of principle must be that the members of the board must not just be financial whizzes. There is a wider public policy issue at stake. There must be broader public membership of this board that will take into account the important issues of protecting the public whose assets we are building, creating and funding here. Whether this is represented by IBEC and ICTU, may not be the best or only way to represent this. The principle behind this amendment is that we need to see more than just stock market players, bankers or financiers on the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_383">Financial arrangements are not entirely insulated from the rest of the project. The financial arrangements impose upon the rest of the project certain modes of operation. If it has to produce a commercial return that means there has to be a certain approach to public pricing of the use of the asset.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_267" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_384">The Minister of the relevant Department, or accounting officer will decide that matter. All this agency will do is will give the best advice as to the optimal financial arrangements. The Minister and my Department will take these other matters into account.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_385">If the notion prevails that one can hive off funding of a project as if it has no bearing on the rest, and that the accounting officer will be a free agent to make decisions in the maelstrom in which they will be operating, where there will not be easy access to public borrowing in the normal way, there will be great pressure on them to go down this route. There will be a tendency to set aside sound public policy in regard to pricing or protection of risk in order to get the money or at least get the project built. The notion will be that someone else will look after it if it goes wrong because the Minister for Finance would never let a project such as a hospital go into liquidation.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">It is important that the agency doing the funding, and which is advising the Secretary General in regard to this, would have a sense of the broader agenda. These are crucial advisers to the accounting officer and the Minister and it is important they have broader expertise and awareness. Deputy Burton's amendment imposes that obligation. While the Minister may say he will do it another way, the indications are that it will be a matter of the usual suspects turning up. That will include the Stock Exchange, bankers and financiers who have not got the wider view of the public good.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">The number three seems to have become the Minister's magic number, with a three year budgetary strategy, three members on an bord snip and three members on the board to be established under this Bill. I support the intent of Deputy Burton's amendment that the board of this agency, if it is to come into being, should be broadly based. It should include representation from the social partnership process. ICTU has been cited in this amendment and a case could equally be made for a representative of the community and voluntary pillar, with which I assume the Minister is not greatly enamoured. It would be on the basis that many of the PPPs which would come into existence with the approval of this agency would have direct effect in the delivery of social services. In terms of value for money and security of the provision of the capital project itself, there is a need for outside voices of people who would be directly affected by the decisions of this agency. I support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_390">Because the board of the agency is exceptionally small, we have specified only two particular partners. I accept Deputy Boyle's comments in relation to others in the partnership process having a capacity to make a very strong contribution in this regard. In effect, decisions on vital infrastructural projects and financing could be made by three people. I regard that as too small. Also, because the National Treasury Management Agency has such a pivotal role and this body is really a sub-set of the NTMA and, strictly speaking, not necessary at all, it is just another layer of bureaucracy introduced by this Government. Nonetheless, the decisions should be made by more than three people, particularly if they are likely to be drawn from bankers and stockbrokers and there is no representation of a wider social interest. Such is the starvation of funding for public projects that Ministers and Departments will be lining up to secure projects if this is to be the only way of doing so. In effect, three people will make pivotal decisions about infrastructure, schools, hospitals and roads. That number is too small.</p>

Will the Minister give an assurance that guidelines will be issued to staff on the matter of crossover by staff using their expertise and knowledge subsequently? They will be in possession of very sensitive information. I know it is not part of the Bill but I believe it should be addressed by the Minister. In my constituency, a former county manager became involved in the private sector within a few months of leaving the  public sector. In the United States, as the Minister will be aware, there are severe restrictions, for quite long periods, on public officials crossing over into the private sector and making immediate use of the direct experience and knowledge gained in their public service roles for personal gain. I would welcome the Minister's assurance in that regard.</p>

I understand that certain guidelines are being drawn up in that regard. However, as Deputy Burton will appreciate, from her background in accountancy, one cannot be unduly restrictive in this area. Efforts by companies to restrict former employees from setting up in competition for a certain period have been struck down by the courts many times. The Deputy has raised an interesting point which has been considered by the Government. There will be some guidelines but we cannot be overly restrictive. With regard to the Bill, section 18 provides for a prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of information. That applies to staff who might leave the agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">(5) It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).".</p>
          <p eId="para_517">This Resolution provides for amendment of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952 and the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992, as extended by the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Act, 2001, in relation to rates of motor tax and fees for trade licence plates. The House will be aware that notice of the intention to change motor tax rates was given in a recent press notice. A 12% increase for all vehicles and trade plate licences is proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I should make it clear that motor taxation is not paid into the Exchequer. Rather, it is paid directly into the local government fund. This fund  which was established under the Local Government Act, 1998 is ringfenced in law for the specific purpose of local government and cannot be used by the Exchequer for other purposes. It is financed from the proceeds of motor taxation and is supplemented by an Exchequer contribution. The fund is used to finance non-national roads and the general purpose needs of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">In 2002, local authority current expenditure will amount to about €3.2 billion. This expenditure will be funded from a variety of sources including income from commercial rates, charges and fees for services provided, a range of specific Government grants and general purpose grants from the local government fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">In 2002, the local government fund will contribute about €987 million or 31% of all current income. This is made up of general purpose grants of €593 million and non-national road grants of €394 million. As Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I am concerned to ensure the viability and well-being of local government. This concern does not arise simply because of my position as Minister, but also at a personal level. My background is in local government. I believe in the local government system and I believe that it should play a central and meaningful role in the lives of all citizens, the length and breath of this country. While clearly local government must complement central government, it must maintain independence and be accountable separately from central government.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">To be of relevance, have an impact and do things, local authorities must have adequate resources at their disposal. I do not want to simply pay lipservice to the local government system. I want, and I intend, that local government will have a fair and reasonable level of resources available to it to carry out its functions in an effective and efficient manner. In particular, in the context of today's debate, I want local authorities to have the resources to maintain and develop our non-national roads system. That is why I propose to increase rates of motor tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">As in all organisations and sectors of the economy, local authorities must continually seek to identify ways of delivering services in a more cost efficient manner wherever and whenever possible. In addition, authorities must always, and particularly at this time, carefully consider their expenditure plans and expenditure priorities having regard to the income available to them. However, even after seeking out efficiencies and pruning back expenditure where necessary, there is no getting away from the fact that to continue to provide good quality services to the public and to develop the non-national roads network, the local government system will need extra resources next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The national development plan provides for investment of €2.43 billion in the non-national road network in 2000-2006. Of this, €1.08 billion is scheduled for the BMW region and €1.35  billion for the southern and eastern region. The BMW region accounts for 40,500 kilometres of the network, that is 45% of the total network. Given the predominantly rural character of this region, I am sure this House will readily agree that non-national roads play a very important role in its economic and social life and must be continually maintained and developed. The very viability and future of the region depends to a large extent on having a good non-national road network.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The southern and eastern region accounts for some 50,000 kilometres of the non-national road network. While considerable economic growth has been achieved throughout the southern and eastern region over the period of the last development plan, much of this growth has been centred predominantly around the region's four main cities and the larger urban centres. This has led to capacity constraints in these areas, while at the same time the more remote rural sub-regions have suffered from the negative effects of peripherality and isolation. Investment in non-national roads in 2000-2006 will improve access to the remoter locations in this region, promote them as places in which to live, work, establish enterprises and improve the quality of life for resident communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The restoration programme accounts for about half of the non-national road State grants each year. This programme was introduced in 1995 to restore regional and local roads which had become deficient through under-investment by successive Governments. A pavement condition study carried out in 1996 identified that over 47,000 kilometres of the non-national road network was deficient at that time. The success of this Government in the area of non-national roads can be gauged by the fact that by the end of this year over 29,000 kilometres or 62.31% of the deficient network will have been restored to good condition. This is real progress. It was the setting up of the local government fund that facilitated this progress. It is as a consequence of channelling motor tax receipts into the local government fund that a link has been created between the amount of tax paid by motorists and the visible and concrete service they get for that tax in terms of better roads and better local government services.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The new rates of motor tax set out in the financial resolution will apply to tax discs and trade licences taken out for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2003. A standard across the board 12% increase is proposed. The new rates for all vehicles are set out in the printed financial resolution and rather than read them and take up the limited time we have available, I would like to highlight for the House just a few details of the proposed changes in relation to private cars and goods vehicles which make up 91% of the national fleet.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">For the lowest engine size car of under 1000cc, the annual rate increase is €15, an increase of 29 cent a week. For cars in the 1001cc to 1300cc, the  annual increase is between €23 and €28. For cars in the 1300cc to 1400cc range, the additional annual increase is €30.  Sixty percent of the national car fleet is made up of cars under 1400cc. Therefore, the annual extra costs for most motorists will be between €15 and €30, between 29 cent and 58 cent a week, or, put another way, between 4.1 cent and 8.2 cent a day. For the remaining cars, the increases will range from €32 for cars not exceeding 1500cc up to €137 for cars over 3001cc. Less than 0.5% of cars in the country are in this 3001cc plus category. For goods vehicles, the effect of the 12% increase will vary depending on the size in weight terms of the vehicle. Some 80% of vehicles in this category are at the lowest level of charge, meaning that they will pay an annual increase of €26 or 50 cent per week. A 12% increase is also proposed for trade licences, or trade plates as they are known. These are the green registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles, which are temporarily in their possession, in lieu of taxing such vehicles. While there are strict restrictions on the use of the plates they are transferable between vehicles. The increase for a pair of trade plates will be €27.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">I want to ensure that local government is adequately financed to perform its functions. I want to ensure the effectiveness and relevance of local government to the public and to business. I want to ensure that local authorities can consolidate and build on the great progress made in recent years in rehabilitating our non-national road network. If local government is to continue its good work, it needs extra resources. Unfortunately, there is no magic wand I can wave to make additional resources appear from nowhere. If additional money is to be allocated to local government, this means other programmes must be cut or extra taxes must be raised, which is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">People cannot have it both ways. If we are serious about the road network, we must ensure there is money for these roads. There is no bottomless pit of money somewhere to be dipped into from time to time. No Minister wants to increase taxes. However, if the Government is to lead, take responsibility and be accountable, hard decisions must be made. I took the decision to increase motor tax rates because it is necessary to protect and develop our non-national roads system, which is the bottom line.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The increases in motor tax rates set out in the financial resolution must be viewed against the background that, since 1993, the rate of inflation has increased by 33% compared to a 12% increase in motor tax rates. Allowing for the proposed increase, the changes in motor tax rates are still well below the rate of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">This financial resolution will cease on the enactment of the relevant Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill, which will be presented to the House at the earliest possible date.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_532">We all have heard of the back door system in the All Ireland hurling and football championships. This measure is a classic example of the back door system in taxation. The measure should have been announced in the budget but as the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, did not have the backbone to give us all the bad news at once, he decided to load it on the unfortunate Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. It is a sneak increase in motor tax in the run-up to Christmas through a guillotined debate, which will have a serious effect on inflation, not to mention the pockets of every householder in the country. I listened with amusement to the Minister when he said people cannot have it both ways. Prior to the election, the Government was saying people could have it every way. This increase, coupled with the litany of increases over three budgets this year since the election, will drive the inflation rate high. Prior to this, I said inflation would breach the 5% mark but, having gone through the collective impact of all these increases, I believe inflation will breach the 6% mark next year, with the resultant consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The Government, with its open promises and deception, has betrayed the electorate who supported it last May but who are now paying heavily for that deception and betrayal, and will continue to pay that cost well into the future. Since the election we have had, in effect, three budgets and a programme of cuts in services. The first budget, soon after the election, saw VHI charges increase by more than 20%, charges in the casualty unit in hospitals increased by 40%, ESB charges by 10%, college registration fees by 69% and the drug refund scheme by 30%. This was followed by a series of cuts in the social housing fund, the programme to extend medical cards was abandoned, the rent supplement scheme was capped, spending on the carer's allowance was cut, the first-time buyers' grant was abolished, community employment schemes were cut by 7,000, including a further 5,000 in the pipeline, and the National Development Plan went 62% over budget and is two years behind schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">On the eve of the budget there was the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin's sneak increase in hospital charges, with an additional 5% increase in the cost of a private bed in a public hospital and the consequent knock-on effect on private insurance. It was the fourth such increase this year and there was a further price hike in the drugs payment scheme. Following the main budget, ordinary citizens will pay more tax, because one's tax credits have not been increased and tax bands have not been indexed. If one gets sick, one must now pay the first €70 per month on medicine and cheque cards and laser cards will cost more. Not only will first-time house buyers not get the grant but their tax benefits will mean less because of the increase in house prices as a result of the VAT increases. Single income families are being discriminated against because there is no increase in tax credits  or bands. If one is concerned about infrastructure, the VAT increase will impact on that also.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Does anyone believe the financial institutions will not pass on to ordinary people the €100 million levy, yet nothing has been done about tax shelters created by the Minister for Finance and the Government to ensure the very wealthy avoid paying income tax in Ireland. The Minister has kept faith with his friends, the big money people, while there is another example today of how ordinary people will be affected. The increase in diesel prices will impact directly on competitiveness. He has tinkered around the edges with the cuts but there is more hidden than exposed. The only initiative to deal with the problem of rampant over spending is to set up a committee. The Minister has failed so far to say how he will address the problem and he is hoping and praying the economy will turn around and bale him out of the hole he dug for himself. Let us hope for the sake of the country that he will stop digging and begin to climb out.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The third budget this year comes in the guise of local authority estimates. Because of the inadequate funding provided by the Minister, local authorities are being forced to impose major increases in local charges. In Cork city this week commercial rates were increased by 6.75%, refuse charges will increase by 30% and car park charges are also being increased as a result of cutbacks by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The Minister has come to this House and tried to justify the increase in motor tax by saying the money will improve the financial state of local authorities and help them out with the non-national roads maintenance programme when, in fact, he reduced the non-national roads spending by 27%, which does not take into consideration the inflationary factor. This increase will take €60 million from motorists and I am asking the Minister how much will go towards improving the national roads?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_538">The way in which Governments and this House used to deal with the public finances was in two parts: first, the publication of a Book of Estimates setting out the Government's intentions with regard to expenditure and, second, a budget which would address how taxation would be raised to pay for it. This Government has changed that system. We still get the Book of Estimates where all the bad news is issued in one go as far as expenditure is concerned but, when it comes to taxation, we are now getting it in instalments. The Minister for Finance came in here on what was the official budget day, held up his head, grinned across the floor at us and told us he was not increasing income tax. In fact, the Government is increasing taxes by instalment. We now have taxes on credit cards, increased VRT, changed rules in regard to payment for hospital care and what we have today is, in effect, a mini budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The motion before us today is about raising taxes from motorists. It is ironic that this Fianna  Fáil-led Government should choose to increase car tax as a way of raising revenue. Some of us have been around long enough to recall 1977 when Fianna Fáil bought that general election by promising to abolish car tax. Car tax has returned as one of the Government's main ways of raising revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">There is an argument for taxing cars to help to protect the environment and to encourage people to switch to public transport. Such an argument is valid only if there is a decent public transport system, but we do not have one. The actions of this Government and its predecessor have meant that the day when we have a reasonable public transport system – involving the Luas, decent rail provision and an adequate supply of bus services serving all parts of the country – is further away than ever. A car is a necessity and not a luxury for most people. Most people need to use a car to get to work as public transport will not take them there, to bring their children to school as we do not have a decent school transport system, to do their shopping because of the dislocation between residential and commercial development and to maintain contact with relatives and friends because of our public transport shortcomings.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The motorist is a soft target for the Government; a sitting duck for taxation. The resolution being proposed by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is particularly cruel as it comes at a time when most motorists, particularly in urban areas, are stuck in traffic as a consequence of the Government's failure to deal with traffic problems. The Minister informed the House that 38% of the roads on which we drive are substandard. The rise in motor tax is unfair because it follows increases in vehicle registration tax and fuel, which is of particular concern to those who drive diesel vehicles. Motorists, especially young drivers, have also had to endure harsh increases in insurance costs in the past year or two.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has not mentioned that he is about to inflict further hardship on motorists in the form of energy taxes. Last week, I asked the Minister for Finance, who has been discussing the matter at a meeting of ECOFIN this week, to outline the position in relation to energy taxes, but he could not do so as negotiations were still at a sensitive stage. The Minister is in Europe discussing additional taxes on motorists, but the Government has yet to say what is being proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has said that the moneys that will result from this tax will be added to the local government fund and will pay for non-national roads. He said that "to develop the non-national roads network, the local government system will need extra resources next year". He mentioned that he wants "to ensure that local government is adequately financed to perform its functions" and he claimed that he decided to increase motor tax because it is "necessary to protect and develop  our non-national roads system, which is the bottom line". The bottom line is that the Minister is increasing motor tax because he deprived the national roads system by robbing money from the local government fund. It was made clear that the money was needed when the Book of Estimates was produced, as the provision for non-national roads in the Estimates was cut by 27%.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_552">This week, the Department of the Environment and Local Government circulated among local authorities details of their 2003 allocations under the local government fund. When inflation is taken into account, there is a decrease in the amount of money made available to local authorities for next year. No provision has been made for the benchmarking pay awards that local authorities will have to fund from their own resources. The net effect of this measure is that local authorities throughout Ireland will have less money to spend in 2003 on maintaining and upgrading the roads for which they are responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The Minister spoke about non-national roads in terms of the road networks between different towns and regions. The worst roads in Ireland are not those that link two towns or villages, but those found in urban housing estates. Such roads are found outside the homes of the people who are being asked to pay higher rates of motor taxation. Many of the estates to which I refer were built 20 or 30 years ago by speculators; the roads put in place were substandard and are now crum bling. The Department of the Environment and Local Government used to make a provision, known as the tertiary roads grant, for such roads, but it is no longer paid. It is another cutback I would like the Minister to explain. The senior engineer in the local authority of which I am a member received a letter from the Department on 13 November. The departmental official wrote:</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I wish to refer to your letter of 6 November 2002 in connection with funding for class 3, or tertiary, roads in 2002. In recent years, allocations for tertiary roads were made from savings identified by this section as a result of undertaking a mid-year expenditure review. While a mid-year expenditure review did take place this year, no savings were identified that could be allocated to your council, or any other county council, in 2002 for tertiary roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Small repairs on worn-out roads in the urban areas where many of the people who are being hit with the additional car tax reside, will not be made as a result of another sneaky cut by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The Government is increasing the taxation burden faced by motorists, on top of the additional costs that drivers already have to incur. It is savaging the financial provisions for the improvement of roads and withdrawing funds from local authorities, which are charged with maintaining the roads network in the first instance.</p>

Today is 12 December and by the time the 12 days of Christmas have passed there will be little left to tax, at the rate the Government has been imposing taxes recently. The three Scrooges – the Ministers, Deputies Brennan, McCreevy and Cullen – seem determined to impose a new tax on the people every day and they are taking it in turns to do so. The Minister for Transport has increased bus fares, the Minister for Finance has imposed new bank charges and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is introducing new rates of motor taxation today. I understand the Minister, Deputy Cullen, will return to the House later today to wipe out social and affordable housing through an insidious Bill. The proposal before the House, to increase motor taxation, is not a good one. The Minister is enshrining a dangerous principle, that of funding local government through increases in car tax.</p>

A much better way of approaching car taxation would be to tax on the basis of mileage. The individual who drives 10,000 miles pays the same tax as an individual who drives 1,000 miles per year. There is no element of green taxation in that.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">The Minister could use a bit more imagination on this. He could do as the Green Party suggested, have a clean air tax on fuel. In that way those who drive the most would pay a little bit more for the non-renewable resources they use, for the pollution they cause and for the car crashes they cause on our roads. It is not a good form of taxation that the Minister is proposing. Not only that, but there is a disproportionate increase on the lower engine sizes on a percentage basis. I drive a Mercedes smart car, which has engine size of 600 cc I pay exactly the same taxation on that as someone with a 1,000 cc car. There is no incentive for anyone to look for a car that is under 1,000 cc.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">There is a dangerous principle at stake here, that of simply having an annual tax on vehicles. There are better ways of doing this. The tax on a ten-year-old car is the same as the tax on a one-year-old car. It should be based on use rather than being an annual tax which has been raised higher on a percentage basis at the lower end of the scale. That is not good in terms of green taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The Green Party will oppose this tax. We feel the Minister could do better and look forward to a real green tax in the future.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_571">This is a further tax, by stealth, announced the day after the budget. As has been said previously we can nearly expect a budget every now or maybe even twice a day. So much for the boast of the parties in power, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, that they are not increasing income tax. There are tax increases every day by indirect methods. This is very unfair  to those who depend on their cars. Everybody will be affected, particularly those who can least afford to pay. It is directed against those who do not have the ability to pay and it is doubly unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">We all depend on the car in rural areas for work and to keep in touch. This tax, together with the increased tax on diesel will have a detrimental effect on people in rural areas. The galling part of all of this is that it will probably make no difference to the non-national roads. If it did, we would all be in favour of it but we are too cynical after years of neglect. Travelling on the roads as a general practitioner I am only too well aware of the terrible deprivation experienced in travelling from place to place, particularly in bad weather and in an emergency. It is impossible to get to hospital within the "golden hour" because of the very bad roads. There is talk of ring-fencing, but people have become so cynical over the years that if this tax translates into black stuff on the roads they will be happy.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">This is a double mirror type of situation. On the one hand we are supposed not to have increased taxation, on the other hand we have it. If this positively affected our situation we would feel differently. With a 3 cent rise in diesel and the application of the 30% rise in vehicle registration tax to cars of 1,901 cc and over, it makes life more difficult for those who have to use their car, particularly in rural areas. We do not have public transport in rural areas so we depend totally on the car. It is a necessity, not a luxury. With the soaring cost of car insurance, particularly for young people, it is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The main road into Mayo, the N5, is a national disgrace. The NRA say it is not for turning. The reason it is not for turning is that Mayo is not a priority. The Government has not made it a priority. This all adds up to neglect of the west.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">I know this is supposed to be a debate about motor tax resolutions, but it seems to be another episode in the budget. It must be the longest budget in history. The Government's spin machine gave a novel take on these motor tax hikes, the extra revenue will go towards improving the country's non-national road network resulting in a direct benefit to drivers. It sounds practical enough at first reading. We all know many areas where this extra €16 million could be spent. Unfortunately the budget estimates show a €14 million cut in non-national road spending, while the total road spending will only increase by 4%, which is less than inflation. With a total spending of just over €1 billion, the extra revenue from this tax will make no difference to road spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Once again there is sleight of hand and a lie. We need to turn this around, stop these mistakes and start governing. The 3% hike on diesel, the 1% tax for servicing and maintaining vehicles should be viewed with the protest of the haulage industry only 12 months ago about the massive increases in costs. This is a very necessary indus try because there are no rail goods services to carry and provide for industry, whether multinational or indigenous. This entire industry will suffer massively as a consequence of these hikes. This should have been done fairly and above board and it should not have been done in this underhand manner. Other increases such as gas, electricity and hospital charges were also announced outside of the budget. The Government needs to come clean. This unending budget, which is lasting almost 12 months is simply not fair.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">We have seen a budget every day since the budget. The increased taxes should be announced in the Dáil on budget day and there should not be a budget every second day. Mr. Martin O'Donoghue, in the 1977 election manifesto, promised to abolish road tax. He said that he would abolish unemployment and if there was no work to be done he would dig holes in the road and make people fill them again. He would not have to dig holes now. All he would have to do, if he were here now, is fill them. That is what the Minister should do. The mistake in this case was that funding for non-national roads was cut in the Book of Estimates. That is where the Minister slipped up. He obviously did not do his homework and hold his share and the Minister for Finance penalised him by telling him the day after the budget to go and find the €37 million which was cut in the Book of Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">From the Minister's contribution, I question the manner in which he is spending the money. I even disagree with the system of using car tax to make up the deficit in the Book of Estimates from the non-national roads. Considerably less than half of this, only €1.08 million, is being spent in the BMW region, which I represent. There are fewer national primary roads in the BMW region than in any other. In my constituency, Galway West, there are no national primary roads at all. We are losing out disproportionately on spending in our area as a result of the way the Minister is proposing to distribute this money which should have been accounted for in the Book of Estimates.</p>

          <p eId="para_581">I will be announcing the non-national roads allocations in January. This money is going directly into the non-national roads fund, as the Deputy well knows. I commended and agreed with the decision taken by the rainbow Government that motor tax should go directly to the local authorities and the local government fund. What it did not do was to link it directly to  non-national roads, as the last Government did. This was something I supported strongly and still do. My job, as the Deputies know because they have rightly been raising this issue in the House over the last number of weeks, is concerned with the funding of local government. I am responsible for keeping it at the level to which we have brought it over the last number of years.</p>

He has already notified the local authorities of the local government fund allocation for this year. Will he issue another circular to the local authorities, in advance of the completion of their annual estimates, notifying them of the additional money they will get from this increase in motor tax? When he issues the circular on allocations for non-national roads in the new year, what percentage increase can local authorities expect to receive compared to the 2002 allocation?</p>

          <p eId="para_603">I am glad this question is being repeated because Deputy Gilmore asked it already. I have made my point clearly: people must not want to read or understand the Book of Estimates. The subhead to which the Deputy refers in the Book of Estimates was the serviced land initiative fund, whose 41 identified projects were almost all completed. We do not roll capital money on. The projects are finishing up so naturally the money is going down. The out-turn for last year was €41 million and the provision for next year is €39 million, so the decrease is not even 21%. The reason for the decrease is that the money has been spent and the projects delivered. That was a specific subhead and had nothing to do with what we are discussing.</p>

Local authorities have already been notified of their allocations under the local government fund. The next circular the local authorities will get from the Minister would normally be a notification about the non-national roads fund. I accept that the Minister cannot tell us, in advance of notifying it, what each local authority will get. Taking all of the local authorities together, however, by what amount will the allocation for non-national roads be increased in 2003 compared to 2002?</p>

All of them are almost complete and the big money has been spent. The initiative, therefore, is coming to the end of its lifetime. I was surprised that the local authorities only drew down €41 million last year. I did not stop them, there was more money there but they did not have the projects to spend it on because they had all been completed.

When we tot up the separate allocations that will be made to the local authorities for non-national roads early in the new year, will €60 million extra be allocated to the local authorities? How much extra, if anything, will there be? In response to my earlier question, the Minister has shifted from his opening script, where he gave the impression this would be extra money for roads, to talking about maintaining the roads allocation. In that case, this extra money being raised from motorists is not extra money for roads at all. If there is an increase, what does the Minister estimate it will be? It is unacceptable that the Minister does not have an estimate of the amount by which the non-national roads allocation will be increased as a result of this measure.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_380">
          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_663">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">In common with other public sector health service providers, the Medical Corps encounters difficulty in the recruitment and retention of medical personnel. The Department of Defence, in consultation with the director of the Medical Corps, is endeavouring to seek ways to recruit additional medical personnel, notwithstanding these difficulties. Competitions are held regularly for the recruitment of medical practitioners and dentists as direct entry commissioned officers in the Medical Corps. Where Medical Corps doctors or dentists are not available, suitable local arrangements are made with civilian medical and dental practitioners to ensure that the appropriate level of professional care is available to members of the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">There are 33 medical officers serving in the Defence Forces. The most recent competition to recruit doctors for the Medical Corps was advertised in March 2002 and so far has resulted in four applicants. One of these candidates was found suitable but declined an offer of appointment, one was found unsuitable and two candidates await interview. A competition to recruit dentists  for the Medical Corps was advertised in July 2002 and so far has resulted in three applicants, one of whom is due to be appointed on 6 January 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The Medical Corps has been unable to attract more than one or two medical officers per year into the service and these generally leave the Defence Forces after one or two years. It is suspected that a significant component of the difficulty in attracting suitable applicants may be due to the unique nature of military medical officer appointments. Service in the Medical Corps is not a professional training employment, such as non-consultant hospital doctor appointments or vocational training schemes in general practice. Service with the Medical Corps for a young doctor tends to be seen as a short-term expedient for the experience and challenge of overseas service, rather than as a long-term career option.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The Medical Corps incorporates the following service components: a planning and advisory function, aimed at ensuring that the Defence Forces maintain the necessary resources to meet medical eventualities; a training function, aimed at ensuring that the skills identified as being required to carry out all elements of the Medical Corps function are maintained; the provision of a medical service in peacetime, including a service to peacekeeping operations overseas and preparedness of a medical service in the eventuality of hostilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">As day-to-day medical care of personnel must take precedence, resources are provided for the planning, advisory and training functions on the basis of their availability. Within the constraints of available medical manpower the corps is, however, increasing its capacity to support personnel on peace support duties overseas through the purchase of equipment and training. Personnel are referred to civilian facilities, where necessary, to maintain the required level of medical services.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The re-organisation of the Medical Corps, which was effected as part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan in November 1998, was embraced as an opportunity to redirect the focus of military medical care in the Defence Forces from a predominantly hospital-based service to one in which primary care, occupational medicine and field support would continue to be further developed. In addition to St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin, three military medical facilities are located at the headquarters of each of the field medical companies in Cork, Athlone and the medical detachment supply and services unit in the Curragh. These have associated infirmaries for the care of living-in personnel – largely recruits and other training course students – who may be injured or become ill. There are appointments for a physician at each facility. There are X-ray, pharmacy and screening audiometry services at each medical facility and physiotherapy services at Cork and the Curragh.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Nurses of the Army nursing service have taken up new appointments as members of occupational care teams in the Air Corps and Naval Service  and it is planned that more nurses will be offered similar appointments in the larger barracks.</p>

          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_671">I am sure the Minister is aware of concerns within the Defence Forces at the level of medical service available to it. Having attended the PDFORRA and RACO conferences in recent weeks he will know it was one of the major items on the agendas of both organisations. Does the Minister agree that failure to take corrective action has led to severe shortages? In the opinion of many the system is close to collapse. What steps does the Minister intend taking to ensure that adequate services are available to the Defence Forces? Does he agree that one of the essential characteristics of a military service is that it places high demands on the health of officers and men? At the moment military personnel are obliged to go to the ordinary public service system to get adequate medical attention. The Army should have its own up-to-date service. Have any representations been made by the representative bodies mentioned above seeking action in regard to their concerns?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_382" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_672">The director of the Medical Corps recently brought forward through the chain of command a paper containing proposals and suggestions for the future development and enhancement of the corps. His proposals and his deep appreciation of every issue involved will carry great weight when further action is considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">It is the nature of the work involved that there is no comparison with hospital opportunities and that has contributed to the current scenario. There has been no fall off in the provision of medical services to the Defence Forces. When provision cannot be made from existing resources, facilities outside are made available. I assure the Deputy that every possible care and attention is brought to bear on the provision of medical services. We advertise and deal carefully with the responses we receive. Soldiers are entitled to free medical and dental care, which is a significant undertaking that would not be possible to meet but for the fact that the majority of soldiers are fit and healthy. We want to keep it that way.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeSherlock" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I read a recent statement to the effect that the military medical service is close to collapse because of the critical shortage of doctors and dentists. Soldiers, particularly those in the Dublin area, have been put on long waiting lists and have to queue up for medical checks before serving overseas on peace missions. What justification is there for a cutback of 31% in funding? Does he agree that there is a statutory obligation to provide a medical service for the members of the Defence Forces which is not being fulfilled? At the end of October there was a 49% deficiency in the number of doctors and a 55% deficiency in the number of dentists in the service. Against the background of the 31% cut  in funding, what steps does the Minister propose to take? He has said a great deal in reply to the questions put down, but he has not mentioned the positive steps he proposes to take. Does he accept that reducing the allocation by 31% does not speak well of his intentions?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_384" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_675">Deputy Sherlock is wrong about the Estimate. There is no provision for a 31% reduction in the provision for medical services. He is not correct about the deficiencies outlined in the paper to which he refers. Some of the establishment figures quoted relate to a time when the numbers serving in the Defence Forces were significantly higher than they are at present and there was little recruitment. In the last five years, a substantial number of young people have joined the Defence Forces while 40% of soldiers going overseas are doing so for the first time. The need, except in the case of accidents, for the intensive medical supports the Deputy is talking about is questionable. That said, there are 33 medical officers in the corps and we would like to have more. We are in the process of recruiting and we enable soldiers to avail of outside services where required. I have not received a complaint from any soldier with regard to the level of medical services and support that we provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Across the spectrum of society, the medical provision made to soldiers by specialists at St. Bricin's Hospital, at the Curragh, in Cork and Athlone is as good as one will find. I pay tribute to the men and women who provide these services. I will enhance them when I can get additional people who apply and are deemed suitable to take up the vacancies which exists. In terms of the overall requirements, no deficiency exists. In fact, there has been a significant reduction in the need for medical services since thousands of 17, 18, 19 and 20 year olds joined up over the last four or five years.</p>

          <p eId="para_677">The Minister must be aware that there is great concern within the Defence Forces at the deteriorating level of health services available. In his initial reply, the Minister mentioned cases in St. Bricin's Military Hospital, a facility which has provided an excellent service to defence personnel over the years. Many of our generals from the War of Independence were given great care there. I understand that even minor surgery is not available in St. Bricin's Military Hospital. Service there is almost non-existent and it has been allowed deteriorate.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_680">I am delighted Deputy McGinley has raised the issue of St. Bricin's Hospital. During the past two years we have been negotiating with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Mater Hospital with a view to having a more significant linkage between the two hospitals where consultants would work for the majority of their time in the Mater Hospital and spend a lesser amount of time in St. Bricin's Military Hospital training and keeping abreast of what is happening in the medical services. We have made a significant investment in St. Bricin's Hospital to prepare for that eventuality. Deputy Gormley will be aware of the pressure for beds in Dublin. We have additional space that is not required for the military. The hospital is required to service our needs but we do not require its full complement of beds. I would like to see those beds used in the wider context of meeting the needs in Dublin and at the same time, with the exchange with other hospitals, improve the facilities provided. I am extremely anxious to explore that possibility and bring the matter to finality.</p>

      <b>Mr. Gormley</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Defence</b>
      his views on the proposals contained in the Barnier report of the working group on Defence for the Convention on the Future Europe, in particular, section 49, which raises the concept of EU states agreeing a percentage of their GNP to be devoted to their national defence budgets and that a certain proportion of the defence budget be spent on equipment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [26215/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_389">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_682">The Defence working group of the Convention on the Future of Europe has been considering the Union's role in the field of security and defence and, in particular, whether there is support for developing this role beyond the arrangements agreed at Amsterdam. The Government is not represented on this group. Deputy Gormley and Proinsias de Rossa MEP participate as parliamentary representatives on the group.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The draft report of the chairman of working group VIII on Defence, Michel Barnier, presents the group's discussions and sets out recommendations for the convention. The various and wide ranging recommendations contained in the report will be presented at a plenary session of the convention later this month, on which occasion the members of the convention will have the opportunity to consider its content.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The Government believes the outcome of the convention will be very influential and, as the Minister for Foreign Minister has informed the House, it is approaching the convention, and will approach the eventual intergovernmental council, in a positive and constructive manner. We recognise the need for debate and reform if the European Union is to rise to the new challenges ahead  and if it is to sustain and develop public support across the member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I am aware of the suggestion that member states agree a percentage of their GNP to be devoted to their defence budgets. This is one of the many suggestions for further consideration contained in the draft report from the working group on defence. The House will no doubt agree that defence and defence policy is a fundamental expression of national sovereignty.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Similarly, defence spending is also a fundamental expression of national sovereignty which is undertaken in the context of ever increasing and competing demands for invariably limited national resources. Defence spending has, therefore, to be undertaken in a prudent and balanced fashion having regard to the prevailing national socio-economic environment and it is a decision solely for national Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The Government's approach to the range of proposals being considered in the context of the defence working group will, of course, take full account of the White Paper on Defence, published in 2000. This reflects the importance which the Government attaches to having a soundly based approach to defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"><i>Additional information</i>It sets out the Government's medium term strategies to give effect to its policies on defence. These policies are consistent with broader Government objectives on foreign and security policy at national and international levels. The concept, as referred to in the Deputy's question, does not appear to take account of these essential national considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I understand the Deputy has indicated, in his own written comments to the working group on the draft report, that the concept would not be acceptable to him.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_690">I am glad to hear the Minister considers the convention to be very influential. How closely has his Department followed the proceedings of the working group on defence? Has the Minister been briefed on the working group? Has he liaised with the Department of Foreign Affairs on this matter? Why is it that neither the Minister's Department nor the Department of Foreign Affairs has submitted a written proposal to the working group as other countries have done? Will he agree that the progress report from Mr. Barnier has profound implications for Ireland? Specifically, what is the Minister's attitude to the Franco-German proposal for enhanced co-operation in the area of defence and does he support it? Does he accept that Ireland, which has the lowest military spending in the EU, will come under intense pressure to increase it?</p>
          <p eId="para_691">While the Minister stated that this is a matter for national Governments, surely he realises there is an effort to move this competence into a Union competence so that expenditure of 0.75% of GDP on defence will be expected to increase  substantially. Does the Minister agree with the assessment of former commandant Gerry McMahon who said that if you are in the club, you are expected to pay your sub? That is the attitude of many within the European Union.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">Of course I keep in touch with the deliberations of the convention. The special Cabinet sub-committee and the interdepartmental group meet regularly. In view of the speed with which things are happening, meetings will take place every two weeks where everything will be thrashed out and decisions taken on the appropriate stance we should adopt. The Deputy need have no fears. We are keeping a close watch on developments as is the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is the primary Department in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">If the Deputy cares to look at the budgets right across the EU he will see whether the response is of the nature he has outlined in terms of massive increases in defence expenditure. That is not happening and it is not likely to happen because of competing considerations. Given that the Deputy is a member of the committee, I hope there is nothing in the report that I cannot accept. I wish the Deputy well at his work. It is a good experience to see the diversity of opinion but in the final analysis the convention will make recommendations which will then go to the Intergovernmental Conference for decisions. The convention will be a major influencing factor. To achieve what we want there are checks and balances – on defence, with some neutral States, on taxation with the British. It is an exercise in which we have to be careful to keep our friends to ensure the best result. I assure the House we are not getting involved in joint military procurement or in any of the suggestions made. It involves the Exchequer. It is a sovereign decision and it will be kept there.</p>

      <b>Mr. McGinley</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Defence</b>
      the situation regarding the acquisition of medium lift helicopters to replace the cancelled Sikorsky contract; and the proposed timeframe for the acquisition of same.
      [26152/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_396">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_700">The decision to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps last July was taken due to budgetary constraints which meant that the level of defence expenditure had to be reduced this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The decision was an extremely difficult one for me. I regarded the acquisition of the helicopters for the Air Corps as a priority. I was also aware of the huge effort that had been put into the tender process by Air Corps personnel and of their evident disappointment when the decision not to proceed was announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">When the decision was made, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopter services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue, while taking account of the current financial position.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">An interdepartmental working group has been established to seek alternate solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions. This work is at an early stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I am committed to maintaining the involvement of the Air Corps in search and rescue for the long-term. In this regard, the Air Corps is in the process of acquiring an S61 helicopter to operate in the north west region to replace the existing Dauphin helicopter. The S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from CHC Ireland Limited pursuant to existing SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide the flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by CHCI. The S61 will operate out of Sligo airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Pilot training on the S61, which is being provided by CHCI, is currently ongoing. Subject to operational demands on existing SAR services and the availability of training assets and personnel, it is planned that the helicopter will go operational in early 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Despite the fact that expenditure programmes have now to be prioritised, I will not allow anything to take precedence over the long-term development of the Air Corps' most important resource, its pilots. The main priority for the Air Corps is the purchase of fixed wing training aircraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The tender competition for the acquisition of eight trainer aircraft is going well and I am hopeful that I will be in a position to make a substantive announcement on the award of the contract before the end of the year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_397">
          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_708">It is regrettable that the first casualty of the cutbacks announced by the Department last July was the cancellation of the order for helicopters. The Minister has admitted in his reply that this was a severe blow to the morale of the Air Corps which was looking forward to their delivery. Did the Minister avail of the cutbacks as a useful mechanism for getting out of the rather dubious contract with Sikorsky? I know that Eurocopter initiated court proceedings because it was dissatisfied with the manner in which that contract was given. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Is the Minister aware that the International Transport Workers' Federation, representing 600 unions and thousands of seamen and air personnel throughout the world, was surprised at the cancellation of the order. It is concerned about our ability to provide adequate search and rescue services, not alone for our own people but on the international front also. Is the Minister satisfied that we can meet both national and international demands? Also, can he inform us when the four helicopters will be delivered to the Air Corps?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_398">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_710">I did not think we would revisit the issue of that contract because it has been comprehensively dealt with in the House. Perhaps the Deputy could suggest how I could save €41 million in six months. What proposals would he put forward and what would he leave out? It is not a simple matter and one has to make serious decisions. I would have preferred to go ahead with the Sikorsky contract if I was in the financial position to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Expenditure on the Air Corps, the hangar, the runway, a contract for the trainer aircraft, a new building for the helicopter wing, the S61 going to the west, the special service commitment scheme for the pilots and a number of ancillary developments, are ample proof of my commitment to the Air Corps. Significant progress is being made notwithstanding that we could not proceed with this particular contract. I am looking forward to developing another way of resourcing helicopters for search and rescue. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural resources is responsible for search and rescue. I am only an agent. We will continue to meet part of the need, a considerable part of which is being met from private sources employed by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural resources. There is always a need to upgrade and that will be done as financial resources permit.</p>

          <p eId="para_719">I would like to take this opportunity to offer my deepest sympathy to the mother and family concerned on their sad loss. On becoming aware yesterday of this matter, I immediately instructed the North-Eastern Health Board to carry out a full review of the incident and to provide me with a detailed report of all the circumstances surrounding this case. This review will be evaluated externally and independently of the board. I also met with the chief executive officer of the board today to discuss the matter. I expect to receive a full report from the board as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">I do not propose to comment in detail today on the specific circumstances surrounding this case.  However, I have been informed by the chief executive officer of the North-Eastern Health Board, that contrary to reports, the mother in question was seen in the treatment room at Monaghan hospital, prior to transfer to Cavan General Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I would like to take this opportunity to clarify for the House the background and present position in regard to the provision of obstetric services at Monaghan General Hospital. The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is the professional body representing the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology in Ireland, and is the advisory body in Ireland for education, training and administration in the speciality. The institute advised all health boards in 2000 in regard to the levels of consulting staffing required to provide an appropriate level of consultant care in the maternity and gynaecological service and on the consultant supervision of trainee specialists. The institute considered that a viable unit requires in the region of 1,000 births per annum to enable consultants to maintain their expertise and trainees to develop their skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The North-Eastern Health Board established a review group on maternity services in its area, under the chairmanship of Mr. Dermot Condon, which issued its report in November 2000. The terms of reference of the review group were:</p>
          <p eId="para_723">To investigate fully all the options in relation to maternity services in the area of the North-Eastern Health Board in the light of current practice, knowledge and developments, both here and abroad;</p>
          <p eId="para_724">to involve in this process, obstetricians, anaesthetists, paediatricians, senior nurses, midwives and representatives of user groups in the local communities; and to seek appropriate expert advice from outside the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The report, having examined the level of obstetric activity at Monaghan General Hospital, which in 1999 recorded 344 births, advised that consultant-led maternity services at Monaghan should be discontinued as the provision of such services was no longer supported by the recommendations of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The North-Eastern Health Board was informed by Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited at the end of February 2001, that insurance cover was being withdrawn for maternity services at Monaghan General Hospital. As a result, the board was forced to temporarily suspend maternity services at the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Subsequently, the board agreed to establish a further review group to investigate all the options fully in relation to maternity services in the board's functional area. This review group, which was chaired by Mr. Patrick Kinder, reported in October 2001. The group engaged in widespread consultation with medical, nursing and other expert professionals, as well as the widest possible consultation with the public users of the service. The board adopted the Kinder report and established a task force in early 2002 to implement the  recommendations of that report. Care process groups have now been established at the Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath hospital sites to develop protocols for the delivery of maternity services in accordance with these recommendations. In essence, Kinder recommended midwifery-led units.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Comhairle na nOspidéal is currently reviewing obstetric and related paediatric, anaesthetic and gynaecological services for the population of the North-Eastern Health Board area, with particular reference to consultant staffing, in the context of current best practice, in order to facilitate high quality and safe services to women and children. It is expected to report in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">Maternity services are characterised by the complexity of their provision, particularly at time of delivery. While it is generally accepted that the majority of pregnancies end normally, without complication, no antenatal screening procedure can guarantee an uncomplicated delivery. In discussions with the board today I have been assured that, following the cessation of obstetric services at Monaghan, protocols were put in place to deal with cases of this type. A key element of the inquiry will be the extent to which these protocols were followed in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I wish to assure the House that this matter is receiving priority attention within the North-Eastern Health Board. I will review the position in relation to these issues on receipt of a comprehensive report from the board and an external evaluation. I expect to receive that report as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">I extend the sympathy of the Labour Party to the family of Bronagh Livingstone who lost her life tragically yesterday in circumstances that give rise to serious concern as to the adequacy of our health services. The Minister's comments will provide cold comfort to the family bereaved by this awful tragedy. I have three questions to put to the Minister. First, does he find it a shameful situation that when a young woman with a medical emergency approached a hospital in which there were people who were in a position to assist her, those people did not provide the required emergency assistance early yesterday morning? When that young woman was referred to Cavan hospital and sent there by ambulance, why was there no nurse available to accompany her on that difficult journey? One can scarcely imagine the awful circumstances in the ambulance on that journey to Cavan hospital without the assistance of a nurse. Why was that the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Second, why was the promise by the North-Eastern Health Board to provide a specialist maternity ambulance not kept? It is reasonable to expect that if such an ambulance, fitted with  an incubator, had been available as promised, the outcome of this case may have been different. Why was that undertaking not kept? Third, undertakings were given by the North-Eastern Health Board, in relation to the reconfiguration of services, to provide a midwife-led maternity unit and out-patient services in gynaecology and obstetrics. That would have ensured that the necessary equipment to assist this mother and her baby would have been available. Why were those undertakings not kept and what is their status at this stage?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_409" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_733">In relation to the Deputy's first question, I agree the situation is unacceptable. In my initial reply, I referred to the fact that protocols were in place and were available for perusal. Those protocols envisaged that when events of an emergency nature occurred, whether in case of advanced pregnancy complications or other types of emergencies, the hospital should be in a position to respond. I do not wish to pre-empt the actual inquiry and report which will have to go into detail, step by step, as to what happened in this particular situation. However, I agree it is unacceptable that a person would not receive emergency treatment. The basic underlying tenets of the protocol would include proper assessment of the patient on arrival at the hospital, stabilisation of the condition and referral onwards to the most appropriate location for treatment of the person concerned. The inquiry will have to ascertain to what degree the protocols were adhered to in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">I also find it disturbing that, for whatever reason – and again I do not wish to pre-empt the inquiry – there was no accompaniment on the ambulance. I have been informed by the board that the emergency medical technicians on the ambulance were trained in the specific area of emergency pregnancy deliveries. Nonetheless, the issue has to be investigated in the context of this case. From my discussions with the board and its preliminary inquiries, the young mother in this case was seen in the treatment room at Monaghan hospital and a decision was taken to refer her on to Cavan. The nature of that process remains to be ascertained in greater detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">With regard to the special maternity ambulance, there is only one such ambulance in this country. The board has stated that no such specific undertaking was given in relation to a specialist maternity ambulance. On the question of a midwifery-led unit, the board has referred to the situation following the Condon report and the withdrawal of insurance. It should be noted that the maternity unit which had existed in Monaghan had just one obstetrician. There was no special after-care baby unit and no neo-natal unit in Monaghan. The unit never operated at the level one would normally envisage for major maternity hospitals. In that context, while the Kinder report recommended midwifery-led units, it was never envisaged that there would be an overnight facility. Indeed, the North-Eastern  Health Board, in its policy following adoption of the Kinder report, recommended that the midwifery-led units should commence in Drogheda and Cavan, to be followed by Monaghan and Dundalk. That was the policy position adopted by the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">In my view, one of the key issues is the degree to which the relevant protocols were followed. As to the issues surrounding maternity services generally in Monaghan, the medical advice at the time was strong. Condon had all the requisite experts on the review group, as did Kinder. The Institute of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians issued strong safety guidelines on the basis of international best practice and evidence as to what should constitute a maternity service, how many obstetricians are required and what the birth throughput should be. It is in light of those recommendations and guidelines the board takes its decisions and that is also what we would recommend.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_738">I wish to express my sympathy and that of my party to the Livingstone family on their tragic loss. If the Minister's wife advised his insurance company he was an alcoholic and not fit to drive a car, would his cover not be withdrawn? That is what has happened in this case. The insurance company was notified about the difficulties in no uncertain terms and that is part of the history of this tragic situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">This is my home hospital. My mother gave birth to my eldest brother in 1939 in my own home where doctors gave them a 40% chance of living but they were brought to Monaghan General Hospital and survived because of the treatment available to them. There was no protocol, the staff just did their job and made sure people were looked after. My mother died in the hospital in 1999, having been looked after exceptionally well by the staff, so I have personal knowledge of the hospital and I am angry at what is happening there now. I am sure the Minister understands that. Since 2 July, the hospital has been off-call and there has been rancour between the consultants and the administrators whom the Minister met today. Can the Minister not resolve the situation so the groups get together, the hospital is re-opened properly and this type of thing never happens again?</p>
          <p eId="para_740">For obvious reasons, I do not want to make any statement on this tragedy because I know the trauma the family is going through and I do not want to be seen to be jumping on the bandwagon – this is too serious an issue. The Minister told us the patient in question was seen at the hospital but by whom was she seen and who made an effort to deal with the situation there? Can he explain how an ambulance from an under-worked hospital was sent at that hour of the morning to Cavan General Hospital without a nurse or  doctor to accompany it? It could not have been too busy to organise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">I beg the Minister to get the situation at Monaghan General Hospital resolved once and for all – it has gone beyond a joke. Consultants, administrators and others are standing on their pedestals but something must be done before more lives are lost. At a recent public meeting, I said that as long as a person died outside the hospital, it did not seem to be an issue for some administrators and that we cannot allow that to continue. The Minster said he would keep this matter under review but I question whether that is now sufficient. We need action now. Will junior doctors be in place on 1 January 2003 and will the hospital be reopened on-call?</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I think today of John Sherry, who lost his lovely daughter and who would himself be dead but for the hospital's intensive care unit, yet that too is now under threat. If I sound emotional, it is because I am. Others may shout about this, but I live with it on a daily, weekly and monthly basis and I have seen the eyes of people in the wards begging me to try and secure the long-term viability of the hospital. It may not be perfect but for God's sake let us make what is there workable.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_412" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_743">I agree with much of what Deputy Crawford has said. He referred to insurance cover being withdrawn and it is no secret that, of all the specialities in medicine, obstetrics is one that has become uninsurable to the degree that the State has had to take over insurance cover for individual obstetricians because of the high level of litigation. The inadequacies in Monaghan, as perceived by the institute, the Condon report and the medical advisor to the board, were highlighted and the insurance company watching and reading those reports took action on foot of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">In respect of the wider issue, my view is known. I have met with the consultants again and there is a basis in the proposals tabled in September for a resolution of the situation in Monaghan regarding emergency, surgical and medical services. Those proposals are still on the table and I appeal to all parties involved to at least take them as a starting position, get them implemented and build on that base. In essence, the September proposals would provide 24 hour, seven day cover at the hospital, elective surgery from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and a treatment room from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. There has been much debate, discussion and controversy surrounding all of that in terms of major trauma cases but only 2% of cases are diverted to the bigger hospitals which is normal in any case. After patients have been stabilised from a trauma situation they are referred to Drogheda, Cavan or further afield.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Since I went to Monaghan, I have sanctioned all the consultant posts I said I would. The outstanding one relates to surgery and is with Comhairle na nOspidéal so it is between it and the health board. The posts have been sanctioned, the money put in place and the other funding for  geriatric medicine, dermatology, anaesthesia and so on have been sanctioned. The Deputy asked what the position will be at the end of December. I have, over the past month, been particularly concerned by the December turnover of junior doctors. I have been meeting with the chief executive officer and his team on this and they have reached an understanding with the Royal College of Surgeons in respect of cover for surgery and the emergency treatment room from January onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Despite the fact that most people do not want to hear the truth, much of what is accredited is undertaken by external authorities and bodies specifically established to make decisions and recommendations on accreditation and the requisite manpower to ensure the proper training of junior doctors. These bodies are established to do just that and part of the reason we have not resolved some of the issues is that some people in the debate have tried to oversimplify it by riding roughshod over the likes of the RCSI, the Royal College of Anaesthetists or Comhairle na nOispidéal. These groups have a statutory remit to make recommendations and we must work with them. I have worked with them to make sure that we get pragmatic solutions to problems like this. There has been resistance to the Cavan-Monaghan axis yet, in other areas, hospitals have linked up to provide accreditation and training so that one set of junior doctors—</p>

I have no doubt that she was seen in the hospital but she was not treated there. Clearly, the reason she was not treated was because there is no insurance cover. The Minister said the rug was pulled by the insurance company and I have no doubt that is the case, but there are reasons why that was done. The buck stops with the Minister and it is up to him to ensure that an adequate policy is pursued so that maternity facilities are available in this hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">This tragedy comes as a direct consequence of the policies pursued by the Department of Health  and Children where resources are centralised into larger hospitals and smaller hospitals are then downgraded. The Minister is familiar with the cases in my constituency where the Meath and Adelaide Hospitals closed down, and people are now expected to attend Tallaght Hospital. It has been said repeatedly that this policy means people have to travel longer distances and that it will result in fatalities. Will the Minister undertake a review of this strategy as soon as possible in light of this tragedy? We will await the outcome of the inquiry but will the Minister review his policy?</p>

          <p eId="para_755">I do not accept the basic tenet of the Deputy's assertion. It is a rather cheap assertion to suggest that the policies pursued have given rise to this particular incident. I do not accept that. Nor do I accept that the Department and health boards have been pursuing such positions. The policy of developing centres of excellence – be they for cancer, cardiovascular care or obstetrics – is based on international evidence. Politicians have to represent people in terms of providing convenient access to services but we must also be cognisant of best outcomes. If health policy becomes just a basic function of politicians, no matter what part of the country from which they come, we will not get a coherent national policy for the development of services or best patient outcomes in the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">In my reply I said that a key issue is the application of protocols. I accept Deputy Crawford's point but in the vast majority of cases babies are born without complications. I doubt if anyone in this House would say that a maternity service with one obstetrician, no neonatal unit or even a special care unit, and no paediatrician on site or on call, is a safe unit in which to deliver a baby. Is the Deputy saying that a politician like me should ride roughshod over all that and make a general statement that it is safe, and to hell with the institute of gynaecologists and international medical views? Am I supposed to ignore what they are saying?</p>

The Department of Health and Children did not ring up the North-Eastern Health Board and say, "Please close  down the maternity service in Monaghan."  We did not do that. In fact, we subsequently approved an application from the board for additional consultants. That went to Comhairle na nOspidéal which initiated a review.

          <p eId="para_779">I appreciate the gesture the House has made in allowing me to speak. Following the tragic circumstances, I wish to offer my sympathy to the Livingstone family. This tragedy, however, was predictable and preventable. On quite a number of occasions, I have stated at health board level that incidents such as this one would occur. I am now saying that incidents such as this will recur if we do not do something about the situation. We are dealing with emergencies, close calls, and deaths at Monaghan General Hospital on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Minister referred to protocols and high quality services but those issues will ring hollow for the Livingstone family today. I do not think the Minister would get much of a hearing from them. Protocols are put in place but nobody knows exactly what they are. Shortly after the maternity services were withdrawn from Monaghan General Hospital, a senior house officer saved the life of a non-national mother and baby. There was an inquiry as to why those people were treated at the hospital. We cannot have it both ways: accusing people of not treating people and then questioning them when they do treat somebody. The appointment of a paediatrician to Monaghan General Hospital would have resulted in people choosing to give birth there thus increasing the number of births at the hospital. The chief executive officer, following advice, decided to take the hospital off call. Will the Minister agree to put accident and emergency services at Monaghan General Hospital back on call immediately? The Minister has the power to do it and he should do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Monaghan General Hospital has an incubator – it cost approximately €40,000 – and the necessary facilities and equipment required to deal with emergency situations. What happened to that young mother was cruel. It is because of protocol that she was taken to Cavan General Hospital. If a similar emergency arises tonight the same protocol will be followed. The Minister should ensure that practise ceases immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Following the withdrawal of maternity services from Monaghan General Hospital, we were given assurances that a specialist ambulance service would be put in place to ensure those in emergency situations would be safely transported to the nearest hospital. We must ensure people presenting with an emergency at Monaghan General Hospital are provided with a bed until a doctor can be called from Cavan General Hospital to provide them with necessary medical attention. Monaghan General Hospital has a role to play and any review of services should focus on its total service provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">The people of Monaghan want to know that if they present at Monaghan General Hospital in an emergency, be it a woman in labour, somebody having a heart attack or a child having been involved in an accident, they will receive vital medical care before being transported to whatever centre of excellence is on call.</p>

The health board has stated that it never gave an undertaking to provide a maternity ambulance. It undertook to provide a second ambulance service and, as such, one was put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I accept the Deputy's point regarding stabilisation. It is a matter of protocol. Many hospitals around the country do not have a full complement of services.</p>

          <p eId="para_790">The protocol should be one of assessing the patient in the first instance, stabilising him or her and then referring him or her to the appropriate location. In this particular case a transfer would inevitably have been effected for the new born baby given the absence of a special care unit in Monaghan General Hospital. However, we must await the report to see what happened from the time the mother presented at  the hospital in Monaghan through to the death of the baby at Cavan General Hospital. I do not wish to pre-empt the details of the report at this time. A number of parties will have an interest in this matter but the key issue is to ensure an objective independent review is carried out. Statements made by various people in this regard will form part of the report which will hopefully provide answers to some of the questions raised by Deputies this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The September proposals provide us with a basis from which to move on. We need to accept them and agree to use them as a basis to enhance the service further. If Deputies could agree to accept what is on the table – there is a great deal of sense in doing that – we could move forward. Too many people are in different trenches on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_793">I welcome that the Minister has ordered a report which he says will concentrate on an examination of whether protocol was observed. To concentrate exclusively on that aspect of this case is to miss the point. The larger point is that the hospital in Monaghan has effectively been closed to business for the past year. Valuable and rare staff at that hospital have been sitting around twiddling their thumbs. Such matters come within the ambit of the Minister. He cannot blame the hospital, the health boards or the accreditation bodies. The decision on the role and designation of hospitals and where specialities are to be placed is a political one, albeit a difficult one. Such decisions rest with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Services at Monaghan General Hospital have been allowed to run down; it is no wonder accreditation was withdrawn. Nobody expects one obstetrician to provide the full range of services necessary. Nobody expects every hospital to provide every range of service and speciality. What we do expect is that every patient has safe access to the full range of services. No alternative measures were put in place when services at Monaghan General Hospital were withdrawn. The regional hospital in Drogheda was designated as an alternative but no attempt was made to improve or expand services there despite the fact that it has one of the fastest growing populations in the country. Moves were made to put a fully equipped and staffed ambulance service in place but that never happened. Has there been any attempt to purchase emergency services from across the Border for the growing population in north Monaghan?</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The reality is that there is no service in this area. We will continue to witness tragedies such as happened yesterday unless the Minister makes the political decisions necessary to deal with this situation. When I raised this matter on the Order  of Business this morning, the Minister said no legislation had been promised regarding the setting up of a national hospital agency. I would like to refer him to his strategy which states, "An independent agency, the national hospitals agency, will be established on a statutory basis under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children."  That body was to make decisions regarding the designation of hospitals. The excuse is being given that we have no agency to make such decisions. Is such an agency to be established or will the Minister make the necessary decisions?</p>

        <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_465">
          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_816">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 which deals with housing supply. The Bill will also make other miscellaneous amendments to the 2000 Act and certain amendments to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1992 and 2002 and to the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981. The Bill will make two separate and important changes to Part V.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">First, it will restore the life of the planning permissions of some 80,000 houses, subject to the developer paying a levy in respect of each unit concerned. Under the 2000 Act, these were due to expire early, after only two years instead of the normal five years, starting from 31 December 2002. The other change I propose to make to the planning code is to give new options for local authorities and developers as to how they comply with the social and affordable housing requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">I stress that the Government is committed to making Part V work. The changes now proposed are designed to make the system operate more efficiently and effectively, eliminate the rigidities that were slowing down supply and bring more social and affordable housing on stream more quickly while continuing to promote social integration. There was never any question, even though some thought I would and wanted me to, that I would set aside the requirement on housing developers to make a contribution to the provision of social and affordable housing. My aim is to remove obstacles and make Part V work to ensure a continued good supply of housing. This is the only way to ensure that affordable housing will be available for house purchasers in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The Government has a proud record of achievements in delivering housing to date. Since 1997, our efforts have brought a substantial rise in output, with a consequent moderation in the increase in house prices. Some 52,602 houses were completed in 2001, another record year, and 2002 is shaping up the same way, with a projected 55,000 units by the end of the year. The strong performance was particularly marked in the Dublin area with over 10,000 units constructed in 2002. The overall objective of the Government is to continue to maintain these record levels of output in order to satisfy the projected housing demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The Government, therefore, decided to review Part V to ensure that it was meeting its objectives in terms of delivering social and affordable housing. The review was initiated mainly because complaints had been received, not only from developers but also from local authorities, that the system was overly bureaucratic and appeared to be slowing down supply, the opposite of what was intended. The review, which was conducted with all key stakeholders, reached some  interesting conclusions on which there was a fairly general consensus. There were two key points. First, there was no support for a complete repeal of Part V. The provisions in relation to making housing strategies, and the requirement to zone sufficient land for residential development in particular, were regarded as positive. However, stakeholders also argued for increased flexibility and less bureaucracy in the operation of the provisions of Part V. A number of stakeholders also raised the issue of the provision which causes certain planning permissions to wither after two years. This provision was not viewed as helpful in terms of increasing housing supply. The changes announced in the Bill are specifically designed to meet the concerns about bureaucracy and flexibility and the withering provision expressed in the review and thereby boost housing supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The Bill will replace section 96 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The purpose of the new section is to give new options as to how an applicant for permission for development can comply with the requirements of Part V. Agreements are currently confined to providing land within the proposed development for the local authority or providing houses or sites within that development. In addition to these existing options, the applicant for permission will now be able to reach an agreement to reserve land or provide houses or sites at another location. Alternatively, developers could make a payment to the local authority which would be used for the provision of social and affordable housing. However, I intend to convey to local authorities my view that financial compensation to authorities, while an option, is the final option. All other aspects will have to be exhausted.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Local authorities will have to negotiate with developers to ensure that each agreement delivers the best possible result in terms of social and affordable housing supply for their area. In considering whether to make an agreement as an alternative to reserving land within the site, which will remain the primary requirement, the authority will have to consider a number of important issues. The most important will be the need to counteract undue social segregation in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">I am determined that this new flexibility in Part V will not lead to builders providing new estates at the edges of communities with no social links and no infrastructure. I will be setting firm guidelines for local authorities as to the types of alternative arrangements that will be acceptable in terms of social integration. The agreement's potential contribution towards achieving the objectives of the housing strategy and how quickly housing is likely to be provided as a consequence of the agreement will also be considerations for the local authority. These changes to Part V are all about delivery of housing more quickly and efficiently. Local authorities will also have to ensure that any agreement they reach is in accordance with the provisions of the development plan. The new provision will not lessen the  obligation on developers. Any agreement under the Bill must result in a contribution of an equivalent monetary value to the reservation of land within the development. In practice this means the equivalent of whatever the local authorities would have saved if they were acquiring the land within the development at existing land use value instead of market value. Any alternative arrangement must be of equal benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">These changes to Part V will introduce a flexibility into the system which will give local authorities a variety of choices in deciding how social and affordable housing requirements of their communities are met. These changes are firmly within the principles of Part V of the Act – to integrate housing supply fully into the planning system and to require applicants for permission on residentially zoned land to contribute towards meeting the existing need for social and affordable housing. This new flexibility is similar to the system in Britain under which developers are required to make up to 30% of larger developments available as social or affordable housing. The aim of the British policy is also to achieve mixed communities with a balance of housing types and tenures. The difference is that, through their more flexible system, they are delivering a greater volume of low cost and social housing. Developers negotiate with local authorities on the level of social and affordable housing provision and on whether to build those houses either as part of the development or at another location, as part of the normal course of the planning process. This is what we are doing, building in this same flexibility and trying to ensure that Part V becomes a settled part of the planning process in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The review of Part V also signalled problems with the provision under which certain permissions withered after two years. This withering provision was introduced to put all planning permissions on an even footing as soon as possible in relation to social and affordable housing. It is estimated, however, that it would cause thousands of permissions to expire. As it is critically important to ensure continued supply in the next two years, I propose to insert two new sections into the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Section 96A reverses the impact of section 96(15) of the 2000 Act, which provided that permissions for residential development granted after 25 August 1999, but before a housing strategy was included in the relevant development plan in accordance with the Act, and to which Part V of the Act would have applied if the housing strategy had been incorporated when the application was made, would last until 31 December 2002 or for two years from the date of granting of permission, whichever was longer. Section 96(15) provided that planning permission would expire for houses within the development for which external walls had not been built by the relevant date, but the new section 96A provides that the normal rules concerning the duration of permission will apply to such permission. Per missions are not subject to Part V requirements because they were applied for before the requirements came into force.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">It is consistent with the principles on which Part V was based that developers of the houses in question should be required to contribute to the cost of social and affordable housing. I considered retrospectively applying Part V to these permissions but, in addition to the legal difficulties in doing so, I saw practical obstacles which would seriously delay the construction of these houses. There would undoubtedly be a legal challenge to such a move, suspending the operation of Part V to those permissions, which could have the effect of preventing construction. If such a challenge were dealt with quickly, developers and local authorities would have had to renegotiate agreements for all the affected permissions, a process that would have taken many months. Construction under these permissions would have had to wait until the agreements were negotiated, which could have seriously obstructed construction of the houses. I have decided instead on a more robust solution that will allow developers to build on the basis of the permissions without delay. In return for extending the duration of permissions affected, developers will be required to make a once-off contribution to funding social and affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Section 96B provides that a levy must be paid in respect of each house for which permission would have expired if this Bill were not passed. I emphasise that it is not a levy on all houses to be built, just those where permission is being restored. The levy, which will be 0.5% of the cost of a house worth less than €270,000, or 1% of the cost of a house with a value equal or greater than €270,000, will be paid to local authorities to put towards the provision of social and affordable housing. Setting the levy at this level should not discourage developers from building. It will be an incentive to set the price of the houses that are built at an affordable level. Payment of the levy will be a condition of the planning permission for each house and will be the responsibility of the developer. There may be concerns that the cost will be passed on to the purchasers of the houses but this section prohibits this. It provides that if an agreement of sale includes a requirement on a purchaser to pay the levy, that term of the agreement will be void and the money, if paid over, can be recovered.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I brought forward two important amendments during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad. The first inserted a new subsection (7) in section 96B to require local authorities to issue a receipt once the levy has been paid. This receipt is evidence for purchasers and their solicitors that the levy has been paid and that the condition of the planning permission has been complied with. It is another protection for purchasers. The second amendment inserted a new section to amend the rules concerning small housing developments which are not subject to Part V, under section 97 of the 2000 Act. That section provided that an  exemption certificate may be sought in relation to small housing developments, that is those of four or fewer houses, or on land of 0.2 hectares or less, which is about half an acre.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">A number of urban local authorities argued that under my Department's residential density guidelines the exemption allowed developments of much more than four units to be built without any social and affordable housing element. In relation to town and city centres where small infill sites of this size are found, the guidelines recommend that, in principle there should be no upper limit on the number of dwellings that may be provided. A site of 0.2 hectares in a town or city centre could therefore accommodate at least ten to 15 units. Requiring the reservation of some of these units under Part V could supply a number of units where they are most needed and supply is most limited. Therefore I brought forward an amendment to reduce the limit to 0.1 hectares and this was endorsed by the Seanad. Deputy Gilmore has raised this issue on more occasions than anyone else and I acknowledge his important contribution to the Bill, as I did when I was in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">This Bill does not just deal with Part V. In preparing the Bill, a number of amendments to the Housing Acts were included to facilitate the supply of housing. The opportunity was also taken to make a number of miscellaneous and mostly technical amendments to the Planning Act, 2000. Part 1 contains the standard citation and definition sections, Part 2 contains the provisions to amend Part V of the Planning Act which I have already outlined and Part 3 contains the other amendments to the 2000 Act. These are technical amendments to the 2000 Act for the most part, although some are more substantial. Sections 8 and 9 amend the provisions dealing with local area plans to clarify that land may be zoned in a local area plan. A second public display period will be provided where it is proposed to make material amendments to the plan following the first display period – this is similar to the requirements for development plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Section 13 will permit a decision by a local authority on a declaration in relation to a protected structure to be referred to An Bord Pleanála for review. This will be similar to the procedures where a local authority makes a declaration on what does or does not constitute development, or exempted development, under section 5 of the Act. Section 15 amends section 262(4) which provides that certain regulations made under the Act are subject to a requirement to get positive approval. This removes the requirement to get positive approval for procedural regulations in relation to development by State authorities, while retaining the requirement that regulations determining the types of development approved under the special procedure will be subject to the positive approval requirement. The same rules, therefore, will  apply in this case as, for example, apply in relation to local authority development.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Part 4 makes amendments to other legislation, namely the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1992 and 2002 and the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981. These amendments are designed to ensure a continued supply of housing. Sections 16 to 19 amend the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1992 to 2002, to introduce measures to facilitate the provision of affordable housing. The amendments complement the changes to Part V. The changes will allow approved housing bodies to provide affordable housing for sale, in addition to providing houses for rental. The voluntary and co-operative housing movement wishes to become involved in the provision of affordable housing and these amendments will facilitate such involvement by enabling approved housing bodies to provide houses under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes and by providing that persons granted a shared ownership lease by an approved body will be eligible for subsidy on their rent on the same basis as under the local authority shared ownership scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">An important change is that the terms of the shared ownership scheme will be amended, in so far as the scheme applies to approved housing bodies, to allow the bodies to retain part ownership of the houses and so ensure that they remain within the affordable housing market. This was welcomed by all Senators. Under these amendments, a person granted a shared ownership lease by an approved body will not be required or entitled to eventually purchase the interest of the body in the house. The lessee will, however, be entitled to eventually sell his or her interest in the house to a person who meets the eligibility criteria applicable to the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">I hope the House agrees that the amendments to the existing schemes provided for in these sections represent a reasonable balance between the right of the lessee to purchase an interest in a house and the retention of a social equity in the house. I am satisfied that this will help avoid undue social segregation in housing projects which the sector provides by enabling approved housing bodies to provide a mix of social rented, shared ownership and affordable houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">Section 20 amends section 10(a) of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002, to correct a technical error in the section in order to permit the National Treasury Management Agency to borrow on behalf of the Housing Finance Agency. While the error was technical, it could have prevented the NTMA acting on the HFA's part when borrowing money. I reiterate that this Bill is primarily about improving housing supply and promoting social integration. The new flexibility will speed up agreements and free up resources. Agreements will be concluded more quickly and more social and affordable housing will come on stream more quickly. The level of contribution required from developers remains  the same, there is no reduction, and the agreements allowed under the Bill will ensure that it continues to support the objective of social integration.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_839">The Bill has to be taken against the background of the provisions in Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 being delayed and opposed vehemently by interests within the construction industry who contested them through the courts. That type of obstruction led to the lack of success in many areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Adequate housing is a basic need which the Government has failed miserably to meet. There are over 100,000 people on local authority housing lists, which are destined to become longer over the next number of years because of policies being pursued by this extreme right-wing Fianna Fáil - PD Government. The recent budgets which we referred to earlier today – three since the election – have hit the most vulnerable in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">While the Celtic tiger was alive the old, the sick and those dependent on social welfare barely felt its benefits. Now that the Government has strangled the tiger by allowing public spending to run out of control, it is society's most vulnerable who are suffering the consequences of the gross mismanagement of the economy. The Minister for Finance, as Minister for Social Welfare, implemented the savage "dirty dozen" cuts. Today the vulnerable are again being treated with disdain. There is high inflation and the measures taken in recent weeks – the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and the increase in VAT on houses – will mean fewer people, mainly young people, will be able to buy their own homes. The pressures on local authority lists will become even greater. Ministers are now claiming that measures introduced by them will have only a very marginal effect on house purchase prospects. How wrong they are and how out of touch they seem to be.</p>

The family will comply with the requirements. They have been given a breathing space due to the reasonable attitude of the local authority official. It is an indication of the pressure that people are under. Deputy McCreevy said that  €3,800 is nothing. It might not be to some people, but to that couple €6,000 was a lot of money.

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_851">I understand that. In a sector where imagination, determination and decisiveness is required, there has been a second major U-turn in the Government's housing and planning policy in recent years. The approach which resulted from the Bacon reports caused instability and uncertainty in the housing sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">This latest and second U-turn is creating further worry and uncertainty. It comes against a background of the Government promising and failing to control the rise in house prices. It also promised to increase first-time buyer's grants to €6,350 for couples, but failed to do so. It promised to accelerate the supply of new houses, and failed. It promised to implement a multi-stranded approach to addressing housing needs, and again it failed. It promised a greater availability of serviced land so that demand would meet supply, and also failed. It promised to commit to a further expansion of the various social housing programmes to make a real impact on housing needs. In my local authority alone there are 700 applications for 42 affordable houses. It promised to implement a full package of reforms in the rented accommodation sector, arising from the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector, and it failed. It promised to consider the introduction of legislation to regulate the establishment and operation of apartment complex management companies. Where is that? It promised to ensure that the comprehensive homelessness strategy, now in place, would be implemented, but again it failed. It also promised to ensure the implementation of local authority traveller accommodation plans, which has failed to be effective. It promised to take further steps to streamline the approval procedures for local authority housing building projects, which has also been a failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">The great surge in house prices over the boom years has caused massive upheaval to the industry. The supply of zoned residential land, the sup ply of houses and the labour supply have so far been inadequate to meet the demand of people wanting to buy a house. The result has been a doubling of house prices and, in certain urban areas, more than a doubling. People who owned property throughout the boom years saw their wealth effectively double and people who did not saw the prospect of owning their own home go further out of reach. The people worst affected by the house price increase are those with income levels too high for council housing and too low to support a big mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">It is naive economics that the Government fails to acknowledge the importance of this group of people as they are the backbone of all of the industries and services. Two types of individuals stand out most in this group, namely the consistent and stable worker who gives 30 to 40 years of his life to one job, providing his employer with great dependability and loyalty, for example a rank and file garda, a production line worker or a person working in education, and those in the younger workforce who will lead the country, in all aspects of life, into the future, ranging from junior doctors to people currently working in McDonalds while preparing for their chosen careers. Without the security of owning their own homes people may begin to question their loyalty or become less confident in their own way of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">What type of Ireland do we want? For years my party has advocated the creation of a national housing agency to solve deficiencies in the whole housing area. There are gaps and bottlenecks in the planning process and in social housing provision. Demand has far exceeded supply in the general housing market for far too long. To tackle these problems the agency would anticipate and prevent instability in the housing market where demand far outstrips supply or vice versa. This could be done by ensuring a steady supply of land to meet demand either by rezoning more or less land or by recommending Government agencies to buy or sell land. In this regard I have tabled questions this week to establish exactly the land and building assets which each Department has and their level of use.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">It would monitor the cohesion between national and local development plans, supervise planning teams as they work with each local authority in developing annual council plans, and act as a liaison between all relevant Government Departments and other service providers to ensure that residentially zoned land is serviced. All of the basic living needs, from transport, education and recreation to water and sewerage, must be planned for and in place by the time the development is occupied. It will liaise with relevant Government Departments to ensure the compulsory registration of all rental properties. This is not happening in most local authority areas for different reasons, but I will deal with that at a later stage. It would also co-ordinate cross-boundary local authority projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The way in which councils have zoned land in the past has not been as effective as the people deserve, and that is an understatement. The long-term consequences of the rezoning of land are so important that all rezoning should be part of a single plan which would obtain for five years as part of an overall longer plan. Creating four or five planning teams of expert professionals to work with local authorities would facilitate best practice planning for a better future. Reasonable time limits need to be introduced on zoned land to stop the practice of sitting on land waiting for its price to inflate. Failure to build within these time limits should result in a compulsory purchase order at the original land rates, plus the cost of construction up to that time. The benefits of rezoned land in making profits beyond the original value of the land should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">One of the major obstacles to providing the supply of housing is inefficiencies in the planning process. Additional resources need to be channelled into Departments that deal with planning and development so that larger housing projects get priority. There must be greater contact between local authorities, public transport companies and other basic necessity providers to accommodate all the extra requirements of a still-expanding house market. It is pointless to attempt to take the pressure off Dublin's housing market and transport corridors if there are no facilities to absorb a large influx of people elsewhere. This is important for our immediate future as Dublin's infrastructure continues to build up, increasing the pressure on bottlenecks. Investment should go to places that have the space to take on extra population and industry. I am worried that in Adamstown and other large-scale housing developments, houses will be built without the necessary infrastructure, transport facilities or career opportunities to sustain the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">A total of 100,000 people are on the local authority waiting lists for housing. We have seen little or no positive change in these waiting lists. In a time of economic boom, the lists have increased by 50%. Given the right-wing tendencies of this Government it is not surprising, but it must be deplored. How we treat the weakest in our community is a primary indicator of social justice. We must determine to right the wrongs this far-right Government has imposed on the most vulnerable in our society. It is blatantly clear that this Government is not concerned with any person who is struggling to buy his or her first home. This has become apparent over the past number of weeks. I am appalled at its attitude to first-time buyers and at the betrayal of the younger generation by the Government at a time of economic well-being. The true colours of this Government are displayed in its attitude to housing, both private and social. I referred earlier to the State assets. Under the guidance of a national housing authority and the Office of Public Works, all Government agencies should collectively release enough land and property to the market to meet the current demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">When will homeless people be part of the Minister's equation? The Government has failed to tackle effectively the growing marginalisation of people with no home. First we must consider why people lose their homes or run away from home. Consultation has taken place, but implementation of the Government's strategy has not occurred to any great degree. Unfortunately there will be no room at the inn this Christmas for many people. The Simon Community of Ireland recently criticised the Government for failing to honour commitments to tackle homelessness made two years ago. It said that the Government's failure to meet its funding commitments left homeless service provision dependent on the generosity of the general public and fund-raising.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The Government's strategy on homelessness defined the role of local authorities in funding a combination of services. It made health boards responsible for funding the health care needs of homeless people. However, two years later many projects still do not know what funding they will receive to cover this year's costs, let alone what will happen in 2003. The Simon Community has said that the Government's position falls far short of its commitment to provide three year funding for projects. It is disgraceful that last year over 50% of Simon services had to be funded by the generosity of the general public. Of course, the Minister is not the only culprit. The Minister for Health and Children announced that he would increase the allocation for the Simon Community from €7.6 million in 2000 to €15.2 million in 2002 and €22.8 million in 2003. It remains unclear how the money will be allocated. The Government has also failed to put the local homeless action plans on a statutory basis and to implement a comprehensive data strategy on homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">According to figures released by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the number of people on housing lists has soared to more than 100,000. This represents more than 48,000 households, an increase of 23.5% from a figure of 39,000 in 1999. At the present rate of progress it could take up to 30 years to clear the waiting lists. This crisis exists because of the Government's failure to satisfy the demand for social housing. It is essential that locations are identified and given immediate priority. However, local authorities themselves are finding it difficult to carry out this task.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, was intended to make a percentage of all new homes more affordable. The legislation, however, has had the opposite effect. The supply of homes and affordable housing has not been increased, rather some counties have seen the supply of planning applications dry up as builders and local authorities differ on the interpretation of Part V. In areas such as Cork, Limerick, Clare and Kerry we have seen this, while in Meath, Wicklow and Kildare applications have fallen by as much as 60%.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The Bill is another reversal of the work carried out by the former Minister for the Environment  and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. In recent weeks we have seen many of his decisions reversed and I expect to see further announcements reversing his decisions shortly. His time in the Department is being effectively airbrushed out. This Bill is part of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The two-year "withering" rule was included in the original legislation because planning applications were submitted to local authorities before the Act came into operation in order to avoid the 20% social and affordable housing stipulation. If builders were forced to reapply for planning permission upon the expiry of planning decisions, they would be subject to the social housing provision. It is estimated that 80,000 planning applications will wither, 44,000 early on and a further 36,000 in 2003. They should not have it both ways: the planning application, if not allowed to wither, should be subject to the provision. This legislation provides for the extension of the validity of those planning permissions to five years. The social housing provision will not apply but developers are being asked to pay a 0.5% levy. I noted what the Minister said on this subject in the Seanad. He should consider making these extended planning permissions subject to the social housing provision. Does the withering rule affect schemes of four houses or less? Will the Minister clarify the position for smaller group schemes?</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_888">I feel strongly about this issue and my views might differ from those of Deputy Allen. If we had not interfered in the housing market this Bill would not be necessary. When the Planning Development Bill was published and I saw Part V, I fundamentally disagreed with it. Some people might accuse me of political incorrectness and say I am against social housing but that is not true. When Government interferes with an industry over which it has no control, difficulties will arise. The role of Government is to create an environment where industry can work. The Bacon reports were a waste of time. If we had not interfered we might now have an adequate supply of housing. All these measures interfere with the supply. That is why we are here today. The investor left the market. The Minister for Finance probably opposed the 20% levy. Money was leaving the country and it was right to let the investor back into the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">We must, at the same time, be conscious of home owners and first time buyers looking for a house. This could have been addressed by addressing difficulties in supply. When we zone land, no matter where it is, we should maximise the amount rezoned and put a time limit on it. When a certain amount of land is zoned, if the approach is minimalist, difficulties will arise. The  availability and sale of land is not subject to normal market forces because people are reluctant to sell it, particularly a person whose land becomes valuable all of a sudden. He wants to hold on to it and pass it on to his children. We should zone more land. I have seconded a few proposals for zoning land in County Wicklow. Some councillors would ride on the wave of the tribunal and have a go at me but if I believe it is right, I will do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The withering of permission after two years is a crazy provision. It is unrealistic to expect someone to get a scheme of 100 houses up to wall plate level within that time frame.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">I have grave doubts about the levy. The Bill states that the levy should not be passed on to the purchaser. Who else will it be passed on to? I cannot see the builder picking up the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">In Greystones Zapi Developments obtained permission to build 1,450 houses within a week of the publication of the housing strategy. The development plan was referred to An Bord Pleanála because Wicklow County Council did not have the staff to deal with it. This measure will save Zapi Developments €10 million to €15 million because the company will pay the levy and will not have to give over the 20%. It would have had to do that if it had made a new application in the event of its permission withering. It certainly would not have been possible to build 1,450 houses within the two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">There should be provision in that Bill if there are 100 houses or more, that would impose a levy for community facilities. When a company benefits so much there should be an obligation on it to put social infrastructure in place.</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_895">In this case, permission has been granted and this Bill is the only mechanism to address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Will the Minister look at the provision for protected structures and increase the penalty for someone who interferes with a protected structure? Where a building is demolished or trees removed, there is currently a penalty of €1,500. This should be increased and a section should be inserted to prohibit development on such a site, as a result. I have seen protected houses being demolished in the middle of the night.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">There are many illegal developments in County Wicklow but the country council does not have the wherewithal to go out and check them. The architect or planner of one off housing sites or estates should be required to give a certificate of completion as per the plans. The Planning Development Act dealt with the situation where an estate would be taken over by a local authority if the estate's residents petitioned the council within a set time frame. No council, to the best of my knowledge, has a system in place to cater for that because they do not have the staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">There is a difficulty in County Wicklow in that the strategic planning guidelines talk about local growth. That can be interpreted so that "local" is taken to mean people have to be blood-tested to get planning permission in a certain place. Mr. Justice Quirke, in McEvoy and Smith <i>v.</i> Meath County Council, rightly states that the strategic planning guidelines are flawed, that local authorities do not have the wherewithal to interpret what “local” means and that this should be re-examined. It is not examined in this Bill. The approach by the county councils of Meath and Kildare is the correct one and I agree that the Members of this House have adopted the wrong one. There seems to be a message from management that the Planning and Development Act is being correctly interpreted; I believe that is wrong. The Minister should look at that and give direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The provision of public housing is not working because we have proactive local authorities. A housing agency is a possible solution but the fact that there are people without running water or electricity in every constituency is well known. Those people do not have the wherewithal to fill out the necessary forms, or get estimates and contractors. If they had, they would not be in this situation. We should have a proactive approach where local authorities take responsibility for housing from the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">Deputy Allen mentioned land assets and said that he was to table a series of questions. If memory serves me, the Minister for Finance wrote to the other Ministers and Departments and it was to be in by December 2000. The Ministers have clearly dragged their heels and it never came in. This is mainly to do with brown sites in and around the city. It should be followed up on.</p>

          <p eId="para_921">It comes on top of the abolition of the first time buyer's grant, the increase in VAT, the cut in local authority housing provision and the capping of the rent allowance. It is shameful legislation and, as so often happens when Fianna Fáil or a Fianna Fáil led Government is ashamed of what it is doing, it is being slipped into the House close to a holiday period, published at short notice, debated quickly and rushed through the House in the hope that everybody will have forgotten about it by the time the holiday period is over.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">The core aim of this Bill is to hand back to the private building sector 16,000 sites that would otherwise be available for social and affordable housing. That will immediately deepen the housing crisis and in the longer term, unless homelessness is to increase, it will cost taxpayers up to €1 billion because the sites which are being lost to public and social housing provision under this measure will have to be replaced at a cost to the taxpayer by the various housing authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_924">I will deal with that. I want to deal with the history of this issue. As Deputy Timmins acknowledges, it was the Labour Party which first made the case for what became known as the 20% social housing provision in planning legislation. It was first introduced in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 1999. If we cast our minds back to that time, house prices were rising rapidly, thousands of families were, as they still are, being priced out of the housing market and it was becoming increasingly difficult for local authorities or voluntary housing bodies to obtain land for the social and affordable housing programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">This must be put in context because some commentators give the impression that the 20% social and affordable housing provision was an unreasonable and draconian measure which was forced on the construction industry. That must be put in the context, as the Minister did, of land which had gained considerably in value due to its  zoning for development by public authorities and which the Supreme Court found, having regard to the common good, was not unconstitutional as was alleged by those who challenged it in the courts. It also comes against the backdrop of the Government's decision to cut capital gains tax for the sale of development land from 40% to 20% and to increase residential density on residential development land which, in some cases, doubled the number of units which could be built on the same sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">Against that background, it was not unreasonable in a climate where public housing authorities were finding it impossible to compete with private developers for the purchase of limited land, where voluntary housing agencies were also finding it difficult to obtain land for the provision of social and affordable housing, and where increasing numbers of people were unable to purchase a home of their own, that such a condition was introduced to provide land for social and affordable housing. The Labour Party and I were delighted when the Government took up the idea and included it in the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">We were the first to spot the flaw and the loophole between theory and practice. The way in which the 20% provision was to come into effect under the 2000 Act made it unlikely, as the Labour Party pointed out at the time, that many sites, units or houses would emerge in the way it was originally conceived. The Bill was published in August 1999 and it took until the middle of 2000 before it was passed by the Oireachtas. There was then a legal challenge, which had been anticipated. The Bill provided for the drawing up of housing strategies by local authorities, which would take up to a year.</p>

          <p eId="para_929">I stand corrected. The housing strategies had then to be included in development plans. That process took the best part of three years. In the meantime, as we predicted, those who owned development land hot-footed it to their local authorities to apply for planning permissions. Those planning permissions did not attract the social housing condition because they came into effect before the housing strategies were included in the development plans. To be fair to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dempsey, he acknowledged, when it was pointed out to him, that this was likely to occur. As Deputy Timmins acknowledged, he responded positively to proposals I made to close that loophole. The way in which he intended to do that, which was provided for in the Bill and which was thought to be constitutional, as all the Bill was, was to provide a finite time for the life of interim permissions acquired in the period between the publication of the Bill and its coming into operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">It is a measure of the degree to which land owners and developers availed of that interim period that to date only 300 housing units have been produced by Part V of the Planning and Development Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_932">I use that figure because the Minister told me two weeks ago that he expected 300 by the end of the year. It is at least three years since the Bill was published. Some 150,000 housing units have been built. Some 300 out of 150,000 or 55,000, which will be produced this year, is not 20%. In the meantime, the Minister acknowledged that landowners and developers have stockpiled permissions for 80,000 sites which will not attract the social housing condition. The Minister proposes to release those 80,000 sites back to the home building industry, which means they will not have the social housing condition attached to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The Minister said this measure will be introduced. He referred in his speech to his concern that the social housing provisions of Part V will affect housing supply. There is no evidence of that. As I understand it, supply this year will be at a record level of approximately 55,000 housing units.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_935">As I understand it, the house building industry is operating to capacity. The Minister also seems to give the impression that unless this legislation is enacted, these 80,000 permissions will wither and disappear into the ether and that 80,000 homes, which would otherwise be built, will not be built. That will not happen. Under existing legislation, any landowners or developers who own those sites for which they have permission can go back to the planning authority and get it renewed. It will not be the same as the long drawn out process of the original planning application. That point was anticipated by the Department. When the Department set fees for making planning applications, it set the fee for the renewal of one of these withering permissions at 25% of a normal fee. It explained that in a circular to the planning authorities which stated that the renewal of these withered permissions would not require the same attention as an <i>ab initio</i> application. That makes sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">Unless the Minister is suggesting that the landowners and developers concerned will abandon those sites, let the permissions wither and hope for a finer day, those permissions will be used. I do not know too many landowners or developers who will let a planning permission wither and not apply for a renewal, albeit one which will attract the social housing condition. It would be an unwise course for a landowner to take because, as I understand the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the down-zoning of land is now poss ible under that Act without attracting the same risk of compensation which attached to its predecessor. If one of the key stakeholders, the home building industry, as I believe it was, suggested to the Minister that it would walk away from such sites and permissions, it was bluffing and the Minister should have called its bluff.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">The Minister also stated that he does not have any choice in that if he attempts to apply the Part V condition retrospectively to these sites, he will run a legal risk. There is a way to deal with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_990">"Flexibility" is the other big word the Minister has introduced. I have no problem with flexibility and I am quite open to having flexible arrangements in the operation of Part V. However, the flexibility the Minister proposes to introduce will restore the old style social apartheid that applies to the location of houses. I was fascinated by what I heard in the Minister's speech with regard to this issue. He spoke of wishing to avoid undue social segregation in housing. I compare that with the speech he made in the other House which featured a couple of interesting sentences not included in today's script. What he said in the Seanad provides an interesting insight into the Minister's thinking in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">According to the Minister, social integration does not mean people living side by side and that some voluntary housing bodies argue against pepper-potting housing through estates for management reasons. He contends that it means ensuring that people of all kinds in a community are represented within a locality, use the same shops and schools, benefit from the same community facilities and travel on the same transport links. That means the Minister has acceded to the view put to him that social housing units should not be built on the same estates as private housing. He agrees that a builder seeing he or she was caught by the 20% rule should decide that the 20% would not be provided on an estate where he or she wished to sell houses at premium prices. The builder could then provide for the 20% at a different site. Whatever old guff comes from the Minister about avoiding social segregation, we are back to the form of social apartheid which places public housing in one place and private housing in another.</p>

          <p eId="para_993">The Minister has slipped into the Bill a provision to allow for the zoning of land in the making of local area plans. We will not get an opportunity to discuss that further because there will not be a Committee Stage on this Bill. It is quite a significant change in the planning legislation. Zoning has always been done in the context of the review or variation of a development plan. This widens the net greatly and it requires much more consideration by the House and its committee than it is going to get as this Bill is rushed through.</p>

          <p eId="para_999">While I understand what the Minister is trying to do, this is an issue that could usefully benefit from a more detailed discussion on Committee Stage. As he is aware – there is some evidence of this not too far away from him – there will be pressure to buy out dwellings from those who enter a shared ownership arrangement, although I understand what he is trying to do in terms of keeping them in circulation as affordable housing, an objective I share and one with which I agree. However, the provision which he is inserting into the Bill needs to be thought through to its conclusion. While it is fine to include it in the Bill now, in five or ten years' time when families concerned start to put pressure on their local Deputies to have the regulations changed to enable them to buy out the houses in question, there will be a different story. This is an issue to which greater consideration should be given.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">The Labour Party is utterly opposed to the measure the Minister has placed before the House. We are disgusted at the manner in which this is being done. It is one of the most retrograde steps that has been proposed for a long time in relation to social housing for which 60,000 families are seeking of one kind or another. Between one third and one half of young families are unable to buy their own home. There are local authorities and voluntary housing agencies which do not have and cannot get land and are unable to compete because of the price of land for social and affordable housing, yet the Minister is giving the biggest Christmas gift ever to the building industry in handing it back 16,000 sites while families who need them for housing purposes will have to wait even longer.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_1003">At the risk of provoking the Minister, I will address my remarks through the  Chair. The introduction of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002, is effectively a statement from the Government of a belief of failure in relation to the policies it is pursuing and which the previous Government pursued in respect of the social and affordable housing provisions contained in Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">The previous Government went to great lengths to resolve the issues surrounding the price of houses, the provision of social and affordable housing and related matters. Expert views were obtained, reports commissioned and recommendations given effect, but the outcome at the end of the day was failure. House prices and local authority housing waiting lists continue to rise while the resistance of property developers continues to increase. The Government's answer was to give in to property developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Let us not forget the courage of the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the various measures he endeavoured to implement, including the requirement in Part V of the 2000 Act to provide social and affordable housing within private developments. That has to be seen as a courageous attempt to level the playing field for all. The Government is throwing out the hard work done by the previous Minister at the behest of property developers. Effectively, this Bill has been designed, drafted and forced by the might of the vested interests in the property development business. It reflects poorly on the Government that it would allow itself be dictated to by external forces. It does not augur well for the prospect of strong government in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Let us be clear about what is happening. Property developers made a judgment that the social housing provisions contained in the 2000 Act were not to their liking. They engaged in extensive lobbying and the Government capitulated. The measures inserted in the 2000 Act were so well flagged that the developers were ahead of the posse. They had sufficient planning permissions obtained for a number of years before the 2000 Act was passed to allow them to continue developing while mounting lobbying campaigns to bring about a change and at the same time flex their muscles in the pretence that they would not continue house-building unless there were changes. The Government, needlessly, blinked first. Developers only make money when they are developing and as sure as night follows day, if the Government had held its nerve and called the developers' bluff, it would have won the game.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">The provisions of this amendment Bill have nothing whatever to do with planning and development and certainly nothing to do with proper planning and development. The 2000 Act allowed us to provide housing at an affordable price. If it had been implemented, it would have integrated the various strands of housing, social, affordable and private, in a more socially respon sible and democratic manner and undue social segregation would have been avoided. The effect of this Bill will be to revert to an unacceptable position where the developer can develop housing in an upmarket part of town or neighbourhood, while at the same time satisfying the requirements of Part V of the 2000 Act by handing over land in the rundown part of town or neighbourhood to the local authority. Social segregation in housing provision is being established in this Bill and is an indictment of the Government. It is designed to ensure segregation is legally enshrined in legislation. That is a retrograde step and I say shame on the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">The Government should have acted in a firm manner, stated Part V of the 2000 Act was irreversible and acted accordingly. Had that avenue been pursued developers would have got the message and knuckled down to developing sites and houses. Instead they sat back and waited to see what the Government would do because they had got vibes that changes were afoot.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">In recent weeks first-time house buyers have been hit sucker punches by the Government. The VAT rate was increased to 13.5%, the new house grant abolished and the price of diesel used in construction equipment increased, all of which add enormously to the amount the first-time purchaser has to find to pay for his or her house.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">This amendment Bill imposes another burden on the house buyer in the form of the 0.5% levy on a house valued at less than €270,000 or a 1% levy on a house valued in excess of €270,000. We are informed the levy cannot be passed on to the purchaser. That is a joke. Does the Minister, his officials or any other Minister seriously suggest developers will not build into their costs the 0.5% or 1% levy? Of course, they will. Put simply, the purchaser will pay the levy.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_1013">I am glad to have this opportunity to speak today about budget 2003. Last week's budget reflects the need for consolidation and re-prioritisation of Government spending  after several years of strong growth. I am happy that, in these difficult economic times, the €390 million available to my Department will enable me to maintain the thrust of State support for the Arts, Sport and Tourism areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The Government remains fully committed to the development and promotion of the arts and culture sectors and to the commitments set out in the programme for Government. However, support for the sector can only be advanced according to the availability of resources. In the case of the Arts Council the allocation for 2003 is €44 million. Funding for the Arts Council has been increased by 80% over the past five years rising from €26.5 million in 1997 to €47.7 million in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The Arts Council's new arts plan 2002-2006 sets out the strategic objectives identified by the council for the coming years. It proposes to continue the transformation initiated by the council in its second arts plan from being primarily a grant giving body to a body that, while continuing to disburse grant-aid, will place increasing emphasis on enhancing the long-term capacity of the arts sector to maximise self sufficiency, and strengthen the levels of management within the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">The significantly increased funding made available for international cultural exchanges will enable my Department to press ahead with planning for major festivals of Chinese and Irish arts and culture in Ireland and China.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">Under the ACCESS scheme, which runs from 2001-2004, more than €45 million has been allocated to 44 various projects throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">The Government remains committed to the strategic development of the film industry, with the film board having the central role in that process. The reduced allocation for the board must be seen against a background in which the board's funding more than doubled over the five-year period 1997-2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">My Department's primary cultural role is to support the national cultural institutions under its aegis through the provision of Exchequer funding on an annual basis and through a range of other policy and operational measures to assist them in developing their services to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">I am pleased to inform the House that, despite the constraints on the public finances, the current funding provision for the National Museum and the National Library in 2003 will be slightly above the 2002 allocation to meet the general expenses of those institutions. I was glad to be able to allocate a 63% increase required by the National Archives in connection with the proposed refurbishment of the reading room to permit universal access.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">We are all aware of the necessity to reduce overall spending in 2003 and in this regard it is unfortunate that it will not be possible to provide any increase in the current allocations to the Chester Beatty Library, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Concert Hall. Pru dent management of these allocations by the institutions will enable these cuts to have minimal impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Since 1977, when the first ever Cabinet Minister for sport was appointed there has been a huge increase in the level of Government support for sport. When the Government of 1997 took office it inherited a budget for sport at around €17 million. Let tribute be paid to Deputy Allen for his role in that department. Today the budget is €161.4 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Since 1997, with the significantly increased spend for sport, the sporting landscape has seen many significant changes. The following are some of the highlights in sport development of which the Government is very proud. The statutory Sports Council was established in July 1999. Funding for the council has increased by more than 100% since 2000, its first full year of operation. With increased government funding the Sports Council has been able to raise the level and quality of support to governing bodies and Ireland's top international competitors are now in receipt of the type of funding and support about which they only dreamed some years ago. A new high performance strategy is being implemented with the help of increased funding of €3 million introduced in 2002, leading to the Athens Olympics in 2004. Ireland has its first ever national anti-doping programme – one of a select group of 30 countries in the world with such programmes. Almost 3,000 sports facilities, at all levels, throughout the country, have received grants totalling more than €213 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">Major national sports facilities have been provided or upgraded. Included here are the new 50 metre pool opened in Limerick this year, a refurbished national boxing stadium and a new national centre for rowing in Inniscarra, County Cork. In addition almost 3,000 clubs and community organisations throughout the country have been supported to the value of €213 million in providing much needed sporting and recreational facilities. Under the local authority swimming pool programme a number of pools have been built and refurbished at Arklow, Courtown, Dundalk, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Monaghan, Navan, Roscommon and Wicklow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Despite the tight budgetary situation, the Government has attempted to ensure that the excellent work carried out between 1997 and 2002 is consolidated. In that respect I pay tribute to my predecessor Deputy McDaid. With the level of funding provided for 2003, the momentum and the commitment to sport by this Government is being sustained.</p>

          <p eId="para_1027">The Sports Council will continue to maintain its levels of support for the wide range of programmes and initiatives in place for the development and progress of sport, from rec reational sport to top national and international teams and competitions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">Now, more than ever before, a strong and vigorous marketing strategy is vital to sustaining growth in the tourism sector. In this context, I was delighted to be in a position last Monday to unveil Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte's marketing programmes for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">In a period of restraint in our public finances, the Exchequer allocation for the tourism marketing fund next year has increased significantly. An additional €5 million in 2003 will bring the overall provision under my Department's tourism marketing fund to €30.42 million. This is a recognition by Government of the importance of the tourism sector to the economy, whether as a contributor to employment, GNP or regional balance. It is also a recognition of marketing as an essential element in the overall mix that makes Ireland a top class tourist destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">The tourism sector has suffered a number of heavy blows over the past two years. However, the doom and gloom scenarios, which were widely predicted earlier in the year, have not materialised. The latest CSO figures for 2002 show a continuing recovery in both visitor numbers and revenue over the first six months of the year. While we may not achieve the record heights of the year 2000, there is a growing air of confidence in the sector, which has been buoyed up by positive results in key markets such as Britain and some parts of continental Europe. The forecasts for the season as a whole are for a moderate recovery – possibly up to 2% in visitor numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">The marketing programmes to be rolled out by Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte next year are targeting a further 5% growth in visitor numbers. These targets would not be realistic without the Government's continued support and investment in this vital sector of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">As this House will be aware, a process of major change in the institutional arrangements for the delivery of tourism policy is being undertaken at present. The new all-island tourism marketing body, Tourism Ireland Limited, has been up and running since early in 2002. We are building on the success of this initiative and have now advanced the change process further.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">In accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government recently published the text of a Bill to establish the National Tourism Development Authority, whose remit will include the promotion of training, human resource and marketing skills development in the tourism industry and other functions currently carried out by Bord Fáilte and CERT. This Bill has been through Report Stage in the Seanad and it is hoped to present it to this House shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">Deputy McCreevy has a proud record of solid economic achievement behind him. He and the policies of this Government have brought unemployment to its lowest level in the history of the State. They have fostered and sustained the most  dramatic period of growth in the history of the State and have brought untold economic prosperity to the citizens of this country. The same cannot be said of his critics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">The most shrill and mercurial of all Deputy McCreevy's critics is the man who refuses to occupy the front-bench seat which Deputy Quinn was recently forced to vacate, preferring instead to occupy the far left place of his colleague from the old revolutionary days – former Deputy De Rossa. The message, to all in this House who care to look, is clear. The once proud Labour Party is not alone routed, it is no more. Infiltrated beyond recognition, the leadership score board says it all: Old Labour 0; Sinn Féin – The Workers' Party 3. As far as the traditional Labour Party is concerned, it is not a case of "game on" but "game over". The foot soldiers of traditional Labour's backbenches and those former leadership aspirants who see only the cold road to the political gulag stretching ahead of them are the new conscripts to Sinn Féin – The Workers' Party. They are sad and defeated captives of the ideological fifth columnists who have colonised their party.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">The annihilation of the traditional Labour Party is complete. President De Rossa, leader Rabbitte and deputy leader McManus, all enthusiastic members of Sinn Féin – The Workers' Party and all that it stood for, now reign supreme. They would have us believe that by changing their name they have gone away. To quote a phrase, "They haven't gone away, you know."  Windscale did not become any less noxious or objectionable when it changed its name to Sellafield and continued its activities as before. The brand re-launch of Sinn Féin – The Workers' Party as infiltrated Labour does not make its policies or its record any more acceptable or any less disgraceful. Those who stood shoulder to shoulder in vociferous solidarity with the discredited economic policies of the former Soviet Union now chose to lecture the most successful Minister for Finance of his generation on economic propriety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">Let us examine the shambolic and shameful economic record of those who have infiltrated and captured the parliamentary Labour Party. Let us know them by the causes they espoused and the regimes they admired. But for the political endeavour of true democrats, including generations of members of the now defunct traditional Labour Party, this country, if the likes of Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy McManus and former Deputy De Rossa had their way, would have suffered the economic, social and human rights deprivations which were the hallmark of the totalitarian regimes they so admired. The fate of the regimes which inspired Deputy Rabbitte until recently stand in stark contrast to the modern economic fate of this country, brought about as it has been by the type of policy which infiltrated Labour under its new leader despises.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">The modern wealth of this country is built on our success in attracting and fostering entrepreneurial initiative. Deputy Rabbitte and the current  leadership of Sinn Féin – the infiltrated Labour Party spent most of their political life advocating the confiscation by the State of that class of industry. The low corporate tax and high corporate yield policy of this Government, which has succeeded in growing our economy, reducing unemployment and boosting Exchequer receipts, runs contrary to everything which Deputy Rabbitte has ever advocated. The reduction in capital gains tax brought about by this Government has succeeded in generating economic activity and boosting the amount of revenue received by the State. Deputy Rabbitte has at least been consistent in advocating confiscatory capital gains taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">The policies which were once reserved to the Moscow-admiring minions of Sinn Féin – The Workers' Party have become the proclaimed policies of Labour. The UK has "New Labour" but Ireland has "Infiltrated Labour."  The crumbs of fiscal prudence which adhered to the old Labour Party have been discarded by infiltrated Labour. Sinn Féin – The Workers' Party has become infiltrated Labour – the borrowers' party. Borrowing is regarded as the solution to everything. Whether it is for current spending projects or simply to secure short-term popularity, the motto is to borrow anything, anywhere, anytime from anybody to secure the final goal of power. Deputy Rabbitte needs no lessons in the borrower's philosophy of taking, keeping and returning. Those who believe otherwise need only ask Frank Dunlop.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">To be fair to Deputy Rabbitte, he has embraced borrowing as a political as well as an economic policy. Burned out former advisers, well recognised as being long beyond their shelf life and clinging to the keyboard-tapping profession much loved by those whom electoral acceptability eludes, are being borrowed from the remnants of former Deputy Spring's political archives. Deputy Rabbitte, in the forlorn dream of recreating former Deputy Spring's Camelot, is trying to re-inflate these punctured Rasputins.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">No step will be skipped in the efforts of Deputy Rabbitte's secret army of spinners to convince the nation that he is the political re-incarnation of former Deputy Spring. Indeed, I fully expect the leader of infiltrated Labour to return to this House after the Christmas break sporting a moustache.</p>

          <p eId="para_1044">This budget underpins the Government's commitment to securing continued economic growth, with a target of 3.5% for the coming year, which would be extraordinary by current standards among our European neighbours, to support high levels of employment and to achieve social progress within a stable and sus tainable budgetary framework. Over the past five years, the contribution of the PAYE sector to the Exchequer has reduced from 36% to 32%. That is very significant in an era of huge increase in the numbers employed. The corporation tax take has increased from 11% to 15%. Unemployment, which stood at 11% in 1997, is now down to about 4.5% and there are almost 400,000 additional people at work. It is very important that the Minister for Finance, in setting out his strategy in the recent Budget Statement, would continue to underpin the good work of the last few years, particularly in the area of long-term unemployment, where the number is down from over 90,000 to just 22,000. A particular objective of the budget was to copperfasten employment in a much more difficult era in international economic terms and to position the economy to grow when there are further opportunities in the not too distant future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">A budget involves making choices. One of the options frequently exercised in the past was to increase income tax. I commend the Minister on not taking that road on this occasion. Ireland attracts 20% of US investment into Europe although we have just 1% of the EU population. That is vitally important in terms of our capacity to create jobs. It is interesting to look back on budget scenarios of recent years. In 1999, much energy was being expended in preparing for the millennium and there was a great deal of concern about Y2K-friendly computer systems. Experts were employed by companies and Departments to ensure that the entire world would not come to a standstill on 1 January 2000 and that computer systems in factories, hospitals and offices would not collapse. One wonders whether those experts invoked divine intervention or whether it was a very clever scam.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The following millennium year, 2000, as well as being a year of great celebrations, recorded very considerable growth rates and a great air of confidence. However, within months of that year's budget, the foot and mouth disease crisis struck, with devastating consequences for the agricultural economy and for tourism. Some estimates have placed the cost to the national economy at well over €1 billion. Within months, the outrage of 11 September had its effects, creating further enormous difficulties in the tourism sector in particular and undermining the economic wellbeing of the entire western world. That was followed by the scams and fraudulent accounting practices in Enron and Worldcom, leading to a collapse in share values and a massive blow to employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">I have listed those catastrophes and difficulties as the background to a situation in which, although the Irish economy suffered some damage, it managed to get through all of those situations, any one of which might well have brought the economy to its knees in previous years. It was a major achievement to get through those difficulties, all of which were outside the control of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">When the Minister presented the budget last December, he predicted Exchequer deficits of almost €3 billion in 2003 and €4 billion in 2004 and those in the context of the circumstances I have just outlined. Nobody could have been unaware that the country's finances needed close attention and prudent management for the next few years. I believe the Government was re-elected to do just that and this budget takes a significant step along that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">The Minister had many options, including income tax increases and borrowing for infrastructural projects, but he chose the opposite – to chart a prudent course and take stock. Anyone who has read the report of the Independent Estimates Review Committee will have found the findings timely and instructive. There is considerable evidence to support its contentions, not least those regarding the multiplicity of agencies and schemes with overlapping roles that detract from effective service delivery. There is also evidence that, while money was plentiful, spending proceeded apace on unnecessary projects and schemes that did not give a good return.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The Minister has been well advised to provide for the pensions scheme and it is prudent to encourage people to save money, especially with historically low income tax rates and, sadly, considerable evidence of irresponsible spending on alcohol, for example, by young people. I am glad the SSIA scheme is unchanged this time but the scheme has given banks and financial institutions considerable amounts of money they may not have had otherwise. It is no harm to examine ways of ensuring that money is available for investment in infrastructure through the national development finance agency and I would like to see the Government doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">The Minister has been prudent on the pensions scheme and the SSIAs but perhaps there are other areas we should make provisions for, for example, costs arising from claims by unsuccessful bidders for the second mobile telephone licence. If it is likely to arise, we must address it rather than leaving it until it is too late. I welcome the €100 million <i>per annum </i> levy on the financial institutions for each of the next three years because it will bring in significant revenue and ensure that a sector that perhaps has not paid as much as it should have will do so. I welcome the closing off of loopholes and tax shelters which will bring in at least €10 million for the next five to eight years and the extension of young farmers' stamp duty exemption for another three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">There has been an interesting debate on the effects of excise duty on the incidence of smoking and drinking. Massive health and absenteeism costs are involved and, although excise duties in the budget are perhaps not the appropriate way to address the issue, we must do so nonetheless.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_594">
          <from>Mr. McGuinness</from>
          <p eId="para_1053">There is no doubt this budget was framed in a time of changed economic circumstances from those we experienced over the  previous five years. However, it indicated the intention of the Minister and the Department to be prudent in relation to the manner in which they collected and set about spending taxpayers' money and that must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">A number of political and economic commentators have reflected on this budget in a way that gives the impression that assistance is not required for the marginalised or less well-off. The spend of Departments after this budget must continue to be focused on investment in, for example, the children at risk programme, community development and ensuring the less well-off re-enter the workforce through education and re-skilling. As well as that investment, the last five years has seen assistance given to families through community development. The RAPID programme has produced great benefits and needs to be enhanced and rolled out in a positive way. In allocating Departments' spend in this area, I ask the Minister to ensure that any programme which supports the marginalised or less well-off, through family support measures, RAPID, children-at-risk or community centres is given as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I have just come from a meeting in Kilkenny which was called to support the Comerama employees following that factory's closure. Castlecomer is in a RAPID area which has experienced little development in recent years and the Comerama plant was the only real employer in north east Kilkenny. I ask the various Government Departments to establish a task force to tap into the energy of the Castlecomer enterprise groups and support the re-development of the plant so the employees can have a second chance. If every Department co-operates under its budget headings, we may find someone who will develop the plant and give fresh employment. For example, there is no reason a FÁS office could not be established in north east Kilkenny so the workforce could be re-skilled. The area is already recognised as marginalised – it is included in the RAPID programme – so it should get first preference and all Departments should fast track any applications under the social inclusion schemes and respond to them seriously. Although there is a cutback of 5,000 in the CE schemes, perhaps they could actually be increased in areas like Castlecomer for those who are unemployed at a time of year no one wants to be. If the efforts of the Departments were concentrated and drew on the energy of local people, we could find replacement jobs and a fresh impetus in the area to develop new skills and give people fresh hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">The measure of any society is how it looks after its marginalised. We must recognise the huge amount of money being spent in the area. The commentators I have heard do not recognise the fact that huge grants are made to community resource centres for IT and development skills that encourage people to seek employment. Departments should continue their spend in that area  and build on the successes of the last five years as well as taking into account the economic downturn which is impacting negatively on employment and education. I wanted to highlight these issues specifically and ask the Minister to focus on them in the coming months.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_595">
          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_1057">I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to the budget debate. I am a person who tries to be constructive and if there are areas where the budget has made a contribution I will say so. For example, I notice a significant increase has been made to the housing aid for the elderly scheme, and in other areas also. As somebody who could probably afford to pay some extra tax, I have always made the point that I would be willing to do so. I find it desirable to pay additional tax to ensure services are provided to people who need them. That is where I disagree fundamentally with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, whom I know well. The budgets he has introduced over the past six years appear to have redistributed income, but the better-off are the major beneficiaries of that redistribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">It is important to maintain a focused view. Some commentators articulate the view that people are no longer marginalised but I am glad to hear Deputy McGuinness recognises that is not the case. Campaigners on behalf of the poor and the marginalised are described as pinko lefties, or whatever name the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, wishes to call us. Does the Minister believe, however, that the Combat Poverty Agency invents the figures that show Ireland has the highest percentage of children living in poverty in the developed world, after the USA? Does he believe that Focus Ireland has invented the homelessness statistics? Did he ever notice that within a five minute walk of this Chamber homeless people are sleeping in doorways? Does he also believe that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is exaggerating when its figures show huge increases in the assistance it has to make available to people for basic commodities such as food, clothing and shelter? The society says that if it had the resources it could spend twice as much.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Over the coming months the Combat Poverty Agency's recent publication, "Against all odds: Family life on a low income", will be studied by all of us, including the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The report deals with the lives of those living on social welfare payments. Obviously that is not mere propaganda by the poverty lobby, it is important factual information garnered by the agency. It shows that there is a significant number of people who have not benefited, or made any significant gains, from the wealth created during the past six or seven years. The additional sum of €6 brings the lowest social welfare payment up to €124.80 per week, but it falls short of the PPF's commitment to bring the lowest social welfare rate to €127 during the life of that programme. The Minister argues that it is ahead of inflation but  seems to be unaware that people on low incomes face higher than average costs because of their low purchasing power and lack of private transport. Those are important factors that must be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">The increases for many social welfare recipients will be clawed back by changes in rent supplements which have been condemned, rightly in my view, by housing groups and community welfare officers. Despite this, the Minister had the gall to claim that the budget protects the weaker sections of society. Perhaps he is living in a different world to the one I inhabit. At first glance, the treatment of pensioners in the budget appears to be slightly more generous than the treatment of other groups who are dependent on social welfare. However, closer examination shows that most of the increase granted to pensioners will be eroded by rises in inflation and VAT. Many elderly live in houses without adequate heating and so they will be hit by the increased VAT on fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">One of the problems we have in dealing with the budget is that we do not know which budget to address. At one time there was a budget every week and then it became a budget per day. As Deputy Ring said, however, it has now become a budget an hour, on the hour. We had many pre-budget increases and then the Book of Estimates delivered a blow to investment programmes by indicating significant cuts in various important programmes. After the budget we had a huge 12% increase in car tax and only yesterday a €43 increase in the television licence fee was announced. I support public service broadcasting and I understand the need for a licence fee increase, so I will not condemn it totally. However, when all these increases are fed into the system they will have an effect. Hopefully, however, the increase will not impact too much upon on a significant number of people in the television licence savings scheme and the household budget saving scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">VHI premia are rising by 19% and electricity prices will rise by 13%, all of which will have an added impact on the cost of living. While pensioners receive a free electricity allowance, it should be remembered that levels of electricity consumed above the allowance will have to be paid for at the higher rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">Deputy McGuinness referred to the community employment schemes and I fundamentally disagree with the decision to cut the numbers on them. On previous occasions, I have articulated to the House the excellent value provided by CE schemes. I traced the history of their introduction and the impact they made on voluntary organisations in the community, including sports groups, literacy and numeracy classes, community development, and the recreation and leisure sector generally. Community employment schemes play an essential role, yet they will be cut by 5,000 this year and by the same amount next year. Deputy McGuinness articulated a strong case as to why the scheme should not be cut in his own  area, given the job losses that were announced there recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs recently confirmed that the back to work allowance scheme has virtually been abolished, except for target groups such as lone parents and people with disabilities. For those on the unemployment register, however, the period of time to qualify for the back to work scheme has been increased fourfold from 15 months to a staggering 60 months. This arose from the Book of Estimates where the financial provision for employment support services was cut. The back to work allowance scheme had been extremely successful, involving some 13,500 recipients. While a study of the scheme, commissioned by the Department, recommended a reduction in the number of places, it also recommended increased funds for better training and support for participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The net effect of the Minister's announcement is to abolish the scheme, which is a crude step. The scheme should instead have been developed and improved upon because it played a pivotal role in assisting people to make the transition from long-term unemployment back into the workforce. The negative impact on the back to work allowance scheme had its genesis in this budget, which contained a number of insidious cutbacks the effects of which will only become apparent over time. Such negative impacts may only become apparent during the debate on the Finance Bill when the technicalities of budgetary measures are spelled out. That is how we will discover the seriousness of the overall impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">By any yardstick, the Minister stands indicted on the issue of social housing because local authority housing lists will continue to grow as a result of the reduction in the overall allocation for various accommodation programmes. There are approximately 50,000 households, representing about 130,000 people, on local authority housing lists and between 5,000 and 6,000 people are homeless. One homeless person is an indictment of us all. A significant number of people once in a position to buy their own homes have been priced out of the market. The Government announced a number of savage cutbacks in the housing sector in the Book of Estimates published on 21 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">We have only to look at the reports from Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold which analyse the house strategies and homeless plans drawn up by local authorities. One report concluded that 33% of new householders – 42% in urban areas – will never become homeowners. That so many people are unable to buy their own home during our greatest period of economic prosperity is a damning indictment of the Government. The report also reinforces the demands being made by the Labour Party. We are asking the Government to reverse the major cuts in housing area, namely the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and the capping of the rent allowance  announced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs which will contribute to an increase in number of homeless people. Single people will be forced out of their homes because this cap provides landlords with an opportunity to increase rents and they will not be able to afford to pay because community welfare officers will not be in a position to pay out beyond that provided for in the secondary legislation in the form of a statutory instrument. That is a serious matter. It is important that the flexibility enjoyed by community welfare officers remains or people will be left without homes. I think the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will listen and take cognisance of such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">Section 266 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 states that people are entitled to a basic maintenance level of supplementary welfare allowance. If they are forced to pay additional rent they will be deprived of necessary funds to survive. What the Minister has done is possibly <i>ultra vires</i> the principal legislation and is something she should revisit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The individual payment under the supplementary welfare allowance has increased from €7.80 to €12, a basic increase of €4.20 which in turn reduces the net increase of somebody in receipt of €6 down to €1.80. Taking inflation into account, people are left with a net increase of 25 cent a week. That information emanates from CORI who have carried out an evaluation of increases in this area. That is why it is important that cognisance be taken of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">Home ownership is now a luxury. It is often the property speculators, investors and land speculators who win out over home buyers and tenants. We should take cognisance of the recommendations contained in the Focus Ireland report and implement them. The Government should reverse the appalling cutbacks announced in this area, otherwise people will be driven from their homes resulting in a worsening of the housing crisis. The Government must pay particular attention to this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">The cutback in the allocation of social housing in the budget in conjunction with the 20% cutback in social housing allocation for new developments under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002 means integration, which was the cornerstone of Part V of the Local Government Act, 2000, introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is dead and buried. It will cost the Government a great deal of money to meet the commitment given by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, during his tenure in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">The budget provided an increase in funding for the improvement of accommodation for the elderly. Of all the schemes to which one could allocate money, the housing for the elderly scheme is one of the most cost effective. Any cost benefit analysis in this area would show it has a tremendously positive impact. I urge the Government to continue to provide money in this area. That money is not shrouded in bureaucracy and is,  therefore, extremely effective. Nobody in the House or involved in local authorities would deny that money spent on home improvements is very cost effective. The Government should continue to ensure those areas receive additional funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">I also welcome the increase in the disabled person's grant and essential repairs scheme. A sum of €40 million has been provided for these two very worthwhile and essential schemes which have become more important at local authority level in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">In the past five years the Government has widened the gap between rich and poor. This is accentuated by the fact that the well off can access schemes such as the special savings incentive scheme while those in relative poverty are unable to do so. This widens the gap further. I can participate in the special savings scheme but a person with a lesser income may not be in a position to do so. CORI has reported that the impact of changes in pay and tax reductions means the gap between rich and poor has widened by approximately €266 in the past six years. Under this budget an unemployed couple with one child will be better off by only 25 cent a week when inflation is taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">The Minister said corporation tax would decrease from 16% to 12.5% from 1 January 2003. This will cost approximately €305 million in a full year. I appreciate the importance of a low taxation environment for attracting inward investment – there is unanimous agreement it is essential – but the Government which said it was in a tight corner with respect to its financial wherewithal could have postponed this reduction for a year. The budget is about vision and choices for society. While the reduction in corporation tax will come into effect in January the increase in child benefit has been postponed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The budget also introduced increases for widows and widowers under 66 years of age. I raised this matter with Deputy Ahern when he was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. I have been Labour Party spokesperson on social and family affairs for only two weeks. The bulk of my correspondence is from widows and widowers under 66 years of age regarding availability of the free schemes. One is most vulnerable following the death of a spouse and it would be of great benefit if the provision was extended for three to five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">As a rural Deputy and former spokesman on agriculture and food, I have a particular interest in the role of women in agriculture and the self-employed. I note that €500,000 has been allocated in the budget to the cost of the rural transport initiative in respect of free travel pass holders. One of the major problems for people living in rural areas is isolation. Transport is necessary for people living in rural areas to be able to combat social exclusion and isolation. Reduced mobility compounds social exclusion and denies members of the community access to basic services, including education, jobs and social interaction. The lack of adequate transport in rural areas impacts  in particular on older people who, even with a free travel pass, cannot access transport from near their homes. Other groups who are at a disadvantage because of a lack of access to rural transport include stay at home parents without a car who cannot avail of pre-school facilities and people with disabilities who cannot access training and education facilities. The mobility needs of the rural population cannot be fulfilled by traditional transport. Current rural transport demonstration projects operate in an environment where there is an absence of clear policies or a regulatory framework for rural transport. I am pleased there is an allocation in the budget for the rural transport initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">The Government should consider the setting up of a rural transport authority to co-ordinate all the bodies involved. It would establish guidelines for the community transport project and social car schemes to operate without difficulty and create standardised guidelines for obtaining route licences from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It would be beneficial to have a simple voucher system which would allow local operators to obtain full reimbursement for 3,000 pass holders from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in the context of the usage of multiple modes of transport. There should be co-ordination at regional level of Bus Éireann, private operators and local community transport services in order to ensure that all public and community transport services complement each other. This is something worth considering. While this process has begun, I urge the Government to continue along these lines and make more funding available in this regard. While very often the free pass is the first thing people receive from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, it is put on the mantelpiece or dresser and is not taken down because people do not have access to buses or trains. The setting up of the national rural transport authority would be one way of ensuring the free travel pass benefits those who receive it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">The Government has been very slow to deal with the recommendations in the report by the advisory committee in regard to the role of women in agriculture. The same principles that emanate from that report in relation to the role of women in agriculture apply to other self-employed people such as shopkeepers and so on. It is important that women working in the rural economy are recognised in both the tax and social welfare codes. There must be some mechanism whereby the value of unpaid work by women in the rural economy is recognised, particularly where it involves caring for an elderly relative or member of the community. We should ensure that the child care needs of people living in rural areas are taken into account in a national child care policy and local access to training for women should be improved. The Government should focus on these important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Under the tax code the Minister for Finance is a great proponent of individualisation but the  opposite view is taken under the social welfare code. I have had arguments previously with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on this issue, and will again, because I believe there is a diversity of views in this regard. When young people reach the age of 18 they are evaluated under the household income, even though they could get married and make major decisions. Individualisation does not apply in that instance, even though it does under the tax code, and this must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">An area which is very important from a constituency viewpoint – I am sure it is the same throughout the country – is the schools capital programme. As the Department of Education and Science has been very slow to implement a significant number of primary school building projects, I ask the Minister for Finance to ensure there is a considerable boost of capital expenditure so that progress is accelerated in this regard. Many children and teachers must work in substandard, damp, cold and rat infested schools. It is very important for young people to have comfort and convenience when they begin their education at primary level. The same applies to a significant number of schools in my constituency, including the Loretto in Mullingar and St. Mary's CBS. I hope the Coláiste Cionn Torc, Castlepollard, project will begin in 2003. What really annoys me about school projects is the time it takes to go through the Department's evaluation process, which involves approximately seven or eight steps. They all seem to get into a backlog system within the Department. Speed is of the essence because very often people are concerned about what is happening. There was a recent revelation that 400 primary school building projects are with the Department of Education and Science and are very slow in moving through the system. Gaelscoil an Mhuilinn in my constituency is waiting to be dealt with. Coralstown national school is in the tender process for some time. A commitment has been given that the project will be dealt with and many of us, including Deputy Cassidy, hope it will be in place by September next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">A number of other school projects have been listed, including Tang, Ballinagore national school, Dysart national school, St. Etchen's, Kinnegad, Scoil Mhuire, Loughagar, and Sonna national school which is awaiting additional accommodation. I know that realistically all these projects cannot be carried out together but the sooner the Department of Education and Science publishes this process, which the Minister committed to, the sooner the various schools will know exactly where they stand. This will mean that Deputies will not be tabling questions every second or third weeks because the schools will know exactly where they are on the priority list and where they will stand in three to six months time. That would be a positive and constructive way forward, which will cost money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">I may differ from my colleagues in this regard, but I believe people would be prepared to pay additional tax to provide these services. The money does not fall from the sky. However, if it would mean an increase in capital gains tax, some of my colleagues might not agree with it. However, I agree with it because the disadvantaged and underprivileged are entitled to essential services such as proper school buildings and other basic necessities, whether at primary, secondary or pre-school level. The people would be prepared to ensure that those services are provided in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">I have spoken about carers on many occasions in this House and the time has come to establish a national carers' register, a database for all carers, so we can know the exact numbers of people who are caring for others. Various figures have been put forward at various times and it is important that we get a definitive number to help the Government to make proper provisions. We owe a great debt of gratitude to carers, who work seven days a week, 24 hours a day and 52 weeks of the year, as they have saved us billions of pounds over the years with their tremendous work. Finally, the Government should consider making similar provisions for those in institutional care.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1085">I propose to share my time with Deputy Conor Lenihan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">Deputy Penrose has always been a very fair Member of the House, but listening to his dissertation on the social welfare aspects of the budget, I am reminded of the fact that the Labour Party was in Government some years ago. It promised an awful lot at that time by highlighting its socialist credentials, but its record does not stand up to objective analysis. Fianna Fáil's record in Government during the last five years can withstand any comparison with the record of the so-called socialists of the Labour Party, particularly the former Deputy, Proinsias de Rossa.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">At a time when the global economic outlook is uncertain and other west European economies are suffering serious economic difficulties, the public finances face a difficult period after years of unprecedented growth. The economy is still growing but at a slower pace, which means that spending must slow too. It is the only tenable approach to the present difficulties but we know it is the right one, as it is the approach we adopted in 1987 which laid the foundations for the Celtic tiger. This is not the time to return to the politics of punitive taxation, massive borrowing and permanent deficits. We must never allow this country to return to the economic crisis of the 1980s, when Fine Gael and the Labour Party's policies led to the emigration of 40,000 young people each year, forced 250,000 workers onto the dole queues and caused Ireland to build up the highest <i>per capita </i>debt in the world. The Opposition parties seem to favour a return to the policies of high borrowing, high taxation and per manent deficits. They did it before and they would do it again but, thankfully, they were not given an opportunity to do so last May.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">The deficits, borrowing and taxation policies of the 1980s are direct concomitants of the fiscal policies being advanced by those opposite. Fine Gael and the Labour Party pay lip service to the notion that spending must be reined in – we heard such ideas from the previous speaker, Deputy Penrose – by greeting spending cuts with apoplectic rage. Such shallow double-think plunged this country into an economic depression in the 1980s and guides Opposition policy today. Opposition parties have been challenged on television, on radio and in this Chamber to outline the cuts they would make or the taxes they would raise to ensure spending is reined in. They have shirked the questions constantly and they have avoided the issues. There is a glaring paucity of workable economic policies on the Opposition benches. While Deputy Richard Bruton says we should rein in our expenditure, his party colleagues claim that the Government is not spending enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">This country needs a clear and definite fiscal agenda and budget 2003, which follows the commitments made by Fianna Fáil in this year's general election, provides such a programme. On 26 April, at the outset of the election campaign, I asserted that, if re-elected, Fianna Fáil would make a commitment to maintaining our annual budgets "close to balance or in surplus", in accordance with EU economic guidelines. I made clear that "our budgetary proposals are responsible and we are going to spend less, borrow less and tax the Irish people less". I also said that "we cannot go back to the era of high borrowing which only ensures a real deterioration in the national finances and contributes to economic instability". I argued, in contrast to the Labour Party's clarion cry, that "we cannot tax and spend our way to providing more employment and better services". My party's stance underlined its approach to the general election, the Estimates and the budget for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">While we were advocating fiscal responsibility before, during and after the election, the parties opposite were intent upon squandering taxpayers' money by spending over €400 million compensating taxi drivers and Eircom shareholders, introducing new 30% tax rates and turning the health services over to insurance companies. Sinn Féin's general election manifesto could have been written in three words – P45s for everyone – and that party is now daring to lecture us about how to run the economy. Budget 2003 is responsible. At its core is a determination to keep taxes, borrowing and deficits down to safeguard the long-term health of the economy. It prioritises the development of infrastructure and the provision of social welfare for the less well-off. The Government's commitment to infrastructural development is highlighted by its allocation of €1.25 billion for the roads programme. This sum  will continue the overhaul of our roads network that is under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">My Department has prioritised the roll-out of broadband infrastructure to bring the Internet to towns throughout Ireland at high speed. During the next two years, my Department will provide broadband Internet infrastructure to 19 towns throughout the country at a cost of €83 million. We see a clear need to drive the information society, but the Opposition does not. When I announced just over a month ago that I planned to issue a policy direction to the Commission for Communications Regulation on flat rate Internet access, among other issues, the Fine Gael spokesperson on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Coveney, released a statement saying that the Government must not impose policy on the new commission. The following day, after a widespread welcome was given to my announcement, he released another statement saying that the directive should be applauded. It was a good example of Fine Gael's on the hoof approach to policy. We saw another example of the phenomenon yesterday when Fine Gael Deputies criticised the increase in RTE licence fee, despite the fact that they were clamouring for such an increase in July 2001.</p>

          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1093">Such reactive, unprincipled politics is the hallmark of the Opposition parties. They condemn everything, proclaim a crisis at every turn and offer nothing productive. Budget 2003 is a rejection of this predictable and short-sighted form of politics. The budget is based on a long-term policy of ensuring the ongoing health of the economy and building on the economic growth of the last six years. It maintains huge increases compared to 1997 spending levels. In my Department, expenditure has increased massively since 1997: maritime safety by 213%, energy by 296%, communications by 7,500%, maritime research by 112% and fishery harbours by 758%. In the areas of marine and natural resources, spending has increased by almost 50% since 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">The social welfare improvements in this year's budget will cost €530 million in a full year. This figure is in stark contrast to the €273 million spent by the rainbow Government in its last budget in 1997, the most it ever spent. I know that we have to take inflation and rises in the average industrial wage into account, but even when we do that it is clear to all that we, on this side of the House, have provided more for social welfare than the parties on the other side. The average annual percentage increase in the old age contributory pension since 1997 is more than 8%. The average rainbow Government rise was less than 3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">That pattern is repeated across the board. For basically every social insurance and social welfare payment our annual percentage increases are double those of the Opposition. Budget 2003 con tinues that trend. In addition, budget 2003 continues the pattern established since 1997 of taking the less well-off out of the tax net altogether. Increases in tax credits and exemption limits outlined in this budget will take a further 37,400 people out of the tax net. One-third of these will be over 65. In budget 2003 we have taken the same number of people out of the tax net as the rainbow Government did in its three budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">The world economic downturn poses difficult questions for all Governments. It forces us to make difficult choices and set clear priorities. Budget 2003 is our answer to the downturn. We have chosen to prioritise infrastructure and the less well-off. We have chosen not to revert to punitive taxation, massive borrowing and permanent deficits. We have made the difficult decisions. I believe they will stand to us.</p>

        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_599">
          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1097">I thank the House for the opportunity to speak again on budgetary matters and, in particular, about the character of the Minister for Finance. He has run a very sensible economy over six years. He has a wonderful record as a Minister for Finance. This is his sixth budget and in all of those budgets, presented by the Fianna Fáil – Progressive Democrat coalition Governments now in our second term, the centrepiece has been a desire to look after the less well-off if there are choices to be made. The choice has been made deliberately and sustained over six budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">Many have misunderstood both the intent and the purpose of some of these budgets, including the latest one. They also misunderstood the character of the Minister who presented these budgets. He is often depicted by Members opposite as some kind of ideological right-winger or conservative. He is the least conservative or right-wing Member of the House. When you examine the record of his budgets he is profoundly left wing. He is prepared, given the resources, to redistribute that income in favour of the less well-off. That is his record. If one only looks at the tax provisions which he has made over his six budgets, they have all been redistributed in favour of the middle to lower income earners. This is on the record and is a glaring example for everyone to see. I am extremely proud of this. It is one of the main reasons that I am and continue to be a member of the party on this side of the House. All of those budgets made clear choices in favour of the less well-off.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">When I campaigned from 1994 to 1996 to become a Member of the House an issue arose which was highlighted by the late Jim Mitchell through parliamentary questions. It was a wonderful device that he used to highlight the income or poverty trap, where the social welfare system interacts with the tax system. It was clear in 1995 and 1996 that one could not offer much hope to people who said that they were drawing a social welfare allowance and it was not in their interests, financial or otherwise, to work. That was the sit uation that the Government led by the Taoiseach and ably assisted by the Tánaiste faced in 1996-97. The late Jim Mitchell identified this in a very forensic way with parliamentary questions and threw up the massive anomaly at the heart of the taxation and social welfare system. The Government identified the problem, took up the challenge and rectified this huge anomaly in the system which cut into the quick of our economy. If an economy and a society does not give its citizens the right to a job then it is discriminating against its own citizens. That was our view when we came into Government in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">In a painstaking and deliberate fashion, Deputy McCreevy went about rectifying this. We see the evidence today. Rates have been cut, bands widened and allowances increased. Not a man to be idle, he decided not only to cut the rates and take thousands of people out of the tax net altogether but to change the whole system of taxation, moving to the more efficient and internationally recognised system of tax credits and individualisation. These were marvellous achievements. To be able to cut taxes and bring the less well-off out of the tax net altogether is a huge achievement in its own right but to do this and reform the system is one of the greatest challenges any Minister could face. I say that even to my esteemed colleague, Deputy Ahern. The great challenge for Ministers now that we are facing more difficult times with scarce resources is to be able both to increase provision while carrying out the fundamental work of reform which is so necessary to be an effective Minister in an effective Government. Deputy McCreevy, in his budgets, has proved himself able for that challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">Other Ministers will have to face this in the next few years. For instance, the Minster for Health and Children will have to look at the health service and the health care business and how it is provided. I do not use the word "business" lightly. It is a business and there are consumers and patients. Irish patients and consumers are not very patient. They want to see better services. They got extra resources and services and are still hungry for more. They want the proper provision and are entitled to a level of service that is equal to the enormous wealth we now have. One of the key tasks for Deputy Martin will be to see how he can reform the health service so that it can deliver for the citizen and the patient. Clearly extra resources have been given over the past five years and we have gone from an extraordinary position where health was chronically underfunded in 1997. Our health sector was way below the European average. The actual level of funding is now on a par with the European average. We are not up there with the French who, as we all know, are fastidious in health matters and overspend on health in terms of their gross national product. Hopefully we will soon aspire to the high standards of the French hospital system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">We will have to make painful choices and take on vested interests in order to do this. Consult ants will have to learn that the health service is not there for them but for the patient. The medical profession must learn new lessons. Some of the hierarchical character of our hospital and medical system does not help the proper delivery of a patient-focused system of health care. These lessons will have to be learned. In a sense, they are matters we would have had to deal with regardless of whether there was a national downturn. Now we will have to address them against a background of a squeeze on resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, will be well able for the challenge of reducing the amount of spending or curtailing the growth in health spending and also improving the efficiency with which that money is spent. The public wants value for money: value for money is the key principle that will govern how the Government is judged at the end of its five year life. If we provide it for the patient awaiting an operation or the person who rings the local authority to get something sorted out on his or her road or in his or her community, and services are delivered effectively and efficiently, we will have succeeded as a Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">The vital work of reform tends to be neglected during a period of plenty, rising incomes and wealth. Over the past five years spending rose, particularly in health. I do not apologise to anyone, however, for the increased levels of spending. Some of the improvements and increases were necessary. The Minister for Finance is dealing very well with the situation in which we now find ourselves, in which the revenue coming into the Exchequer is vastly reduced. Some on the benches opposite, and some rather confused economists, have tried to present this as mismanagement of the public finances. The harsh reality is that other countries, most strikingly the United Kingdom and Germany, are going through their own crises in public finances. They have been having a horrendous time trying to cope with a massive downturn in the same timeframe as the one in which we encountered these difficulties – the period from April and May 2002 to now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">All of the countries concerned have experienced a huge downturn in taxation revenues. This is not happening because of some mysterious mismanagement but because we are now on a much lower trajectory of international economic growth. We can see the difficulties being experienced by the Bush regime in the USA in trying to apply a fiscal stimulus to an economy that is clearly stagnating. There are people here who believe a pro-cyclical approach such as that exercised in the USA would be the appropriate action to take. Deputy Rabbitte, in his budget contribution, made the point that we did not borrow enough. It is a point worth debating but useful to come to a conclusion, too. We must not misunderstand the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">A fascinating report produced in the last week or so by the National Economic and Social Council deals with the character and nature of the  economy and our levels of social provision, with the challenges we face as a society and an economy into the future. One of the key points dealt with by this report, in its first chapter, is the character of the economy. It makes a very telling point when it states the economy has all the characteristics of a regional rather than a national economy. We are subject to huge inflows and outflows of capital and investment funds. That is there for a reason – for a small country we are, according to a UN report published during the summer, one of the most competitive open economies in the world, which is remarkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">The Taoiseach was keen to point out during the second Nice treaty referendum another key fact that we must keep in the foreground when talking about the economy. Of everything physically produced in this country, 90% goes for export. We have a very open economy which is dependent on internal investment flows and foreign direct investment. We are also exceedingly dependent on the global economy. We have one of the most competitive economies in the world in that category. No Minister for Finance, not even a fantastic one like the current Minister, can ignore the international economy. We cannot stand, Canute-like, trying to turn back the waves. The waves are not particularly helpful to us now in terms of the international outlook.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">There was an expectation, not just among the Minister and his Department of Finance officials but also at an international level, especially in the USA, that there would be a recovery from mid-2002. That hope has turned out to be false. The recovery simply did not materialise. Many of the economic forecasts which underpinned the policies of this and the previous Government, before and after the general election, were predicated on a return to growth in the middle of 2002. The same mistake was made in the United Kingdom and Germany. Now, as we all know, we are €1 billion short in terms of revenue. We have €1 billion less available to the Exchequer than we expected when we framed the last budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">The NESC report states openly – I am surprised that Deputy Rabbitte did not pick up on this point – that it is very important that we avoid a pro-cyclical approach to any public finance difficulties we might face. We cannot simply let out spending or increase borrowing to the same extent that large national economies such as those of the USA and the United Kingdom can. Their economies are far less dependent on exports and inward flows of investment and investors. They can afford to put up spending while we cannot. If we go for the pro-cyclical approach advocated by Deputy Rabbitte in his budget speech, the economy will become uncompetitive. We must remain very competitive, given the fact that 90% of our goods are exported, or else we will see a loss of jobs and investment. People invest here because our wages are competitive and remain so, but we have to be careful. We cannot treat ourselves to huge increases in  wages; they will have to be pegged back. I do not envy the Minister in this task.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">The budget is yesterday's news. The news today and tomorrow will be how the Minister and Government handle the next round of negotiations on the national pay deal, which will replace the deal now coming to the end of its shelf life. That will be the critical decision for the Government. If we err on the side of over-generosity on this pay deal, we will be storing up massive problems for ourselves and putting at risk all we have gained over the last ten years. The Government and we, as individuals, have lost sight of the issue of prices. We now have to watch prices rising. In the good times we took our eye off the ball. We did not watch prices or worry when we went into a shop and spotted that some item was perhaps 50% more expensive than it had been the previous week. We must crack down heavily on opportunistic price rises in the retail and services sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">We must also renew our commitment to providing, not just a low tax economy, but also a low inflation economy. That will be an enormous challenge for the Minister because inflation is at now 4.8% and set to hit 5% next year. The real danger, one which could put the budget off the rails, would be an inflation outturn of about 6% next year, which would have implications, not only for the pay discussions, but also for our competitiveness in the future and our ability to trade goods and services on the international market. We clearly cannot keep up our level of competitiveness if we are paying ourselves too much.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">We have turned the corner in our economic expectations. We went through a dismal period – Mr. Haughey and Fianna Fáil did not play a glorious role in the handling of the public finances – but when challenged to deal with them in 1987, Mr. Haughey did so. The Ceann Comhairle knows as well as anyone the problems hard times can bring. He was in the invidious position, although it was fortunate for the State he was there, of having to make the tough decisions between 1987 and 1989, decisions which were politically unpopular but are the source of our current success. Much harder decisions were needed then than are being asked for now. We are now enjoying the gains from those focused decisions on an investment track to raise this State from a dismal to a strong economic performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">I commend the budget to the House. I also recommend that Members read the report of the independent Estimates review committee by Dermot Quigley, Kevin Bonner and Maurice O'Connell. It is fascinating and if Members read it rather than the detailed provisions of the budget measures and the Minister's Budget Statement, they might learn something of the shape of things to come and the hard decisions we may yet have to take if, as is being forecast, recovery does not materialise in the third quarter of next year.  We will then face two or three years of reduced economic growth. If that is the case, the Minister has been very wise in not borrowing at this point. It could be that in two or three years, if we are not out of the downturn, that would be the appropriate time to borrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">We are lucky that the Minister has paid off much of the national debt. We, therefore, have freedom to manoeuvre. He has also paid into the pension reserve fund and the SSIAs. If we are facing a period of sluggish economic growth and poor consumer confidence, the savings scheme may be the release valve that will help lift the economy when and if a US recovery occurs. There is a lag of up to 15 months between a recovery in the United States and a recovery in the economy. Then, when it is clear the US economy is recovering, we might have to press the borrowing button or exercise the pro-cyclical choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">It was not my intention to go on so long, but I appreciate the rapt attention of the Opposition. It shows that, unlike the unruly behaviour last night, Members on the other side of the House are willing to learn. I see Deputy Healy is back in the Chamber. He is a socialist who is learning the true facts of the Government. He may yet support it in the brave work it is doing for the economy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_600">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_1116">If there was any doubt before, we can be certain now that Christmas is upon us. There was a pantomime last night from Deputy Conor Lenihan and a fairytale tonight. There is doom and gloom, a financial crisis, a scarcity of resources and a huge downturn. This gloomy picture is being painted by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and it is an absolute fairytale that is being swallowed hook, line and sinker by the press and media, which do not even think it worthwhile to be here. There is no crisis. There is a budget surplus on current account for 2002 of €3.4 billion. When current and capital accounts are taken into consideration, there is still a surplus. It is a fairytale.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">Deputy Lenihan told us that the figures given out at election time were based on an upturn in the economy in June. Again, nothing could have been further from the truth. On 5 December 2001 the Government notified the European Union of cuts in excess of €900 million for this year. It was well aware of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">I agree with Deputy Lenihan that this is not mismanagement by the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach. It is a deliberate choice to ensure those who became even richer under the Celtic tiger hold onto those riches while the sick and the poor are left behind. There is no justification whatsoever for the spending restrictions on essential services such as health, education, housing, social welfare and local authority services, for leaving hundreds of thousands of low income families without medical cards as a result of which they have to choose between taking a child to the doctor or putting food on the table and for delaying pay rises to public service  workers. This is barbarism, an ideologically driven choice, Thatcherism at its worst.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">This is the most right wing Government since the foundation of the State. It acts on behalf of IBEC and is determined that the super-rich who grew even fatter in the boom will hold onto their riches and to hell with everyone else. The economic slowdown is now being used to sell off State assets at knockdown prices to the same super-rich. Everything must be privatised. Markets are everything and society and the poor nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">The first Free State Government took one shilling from the old age pensioner. We can compare it today with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance leaving those on half the minimum wage without a medical card, even though there is a Government surplus of €3.4 billion. The social democratic wing of Fianna Fáil has been routed and the free market fanatics of the Progressive Democrats have been brought into government, even though there is an overall Fianna Fáil majority in the House. Thatcherism reigns and IBEC rules in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">When Deputy Quinn stood up as Minister for Finance six years ago there was a surplus of £200,000 on current account. When the Minister for Finance rose to deliver the budget, there was a surplus of €3.4 billion on the same account. National production as measured by gross domestic product rose from €67 billion in 1997 to €115 billion in 2001, a rise of over 70%. Even at constant prices, the rise was over 40%. Despite that, income gaps widened and the very rich received a disproportionate share of this massive increase in wealth. They are unwilling to share it and this Government is their agent. The poor are to be left without access to doctors, to suffer a higher incidence of disease and earlier death. Ernest Blythe is not dead while Deputies McCreevy, Harney and their front-man, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, remain in power. I appeal to Fianna Fáil backbenchers not to wait while others suffer. They can change this Government without a general election and should do so now. This ideology is inhumanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">This budget in simple terms means that the rich get richer and the poor poorer. Over the past six budgets, a gap of €250 per week between rich and poor has been created. This budget means that people on the minimum wage are still in the tax net and, in addition, some €300 million will be taken from the pockets of PAYE workers in the coming year. The real touchstone for this budget is the manner in which the Government has agreed to implement the promised reduction from 16% to 12.5% in the tax on corporate profits while at the same time refusing to implement the promised increase in child benefit. Children are to suffer while the good times continue for the super rich.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">In the area of health services, the budget means that there will be no radiotherapy service for cancer patients based at Waterford Regional Hospital, there will be long waiting lists and people will have to lie on trolleys in accident and  emergency departments and on beds in corridors in St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel. Those with no medical cards will have to pay the price of a mortgage for their drugs on a monthly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">Children will continue to be educated in damp, rundown, rat-infested schools and with regard to housing, hundreds more will be homeless and on the streets of Dublin and cities and towns around the country. The 1,000 applicants on housing waiting lists in my constituency will have to wait up to six years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_601">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1125">It is an understatement that I am extremely disappointed with the budget. The failure to give medical cards to those who deserve them was a bad move. The decision to prioritise the better-off over 70s by automatically giving them medical cards was morally questionable. The ethos of the general medical services is to help poorer people. Not alone could 200,000 people who needed medical cards have got them but another 250,000 could also have got them. Government thinking is completely lopsided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">It would make more sense on a value for money basis to direct people towards the general medical services than to expensive hospital services because once in, it is hard to get out. Having worked in the system, I know that once people are in hospital they stay in, because that is the way it works. It is like having two machines, one more expensive than the other to run. A good businessman will use the less expensive machine that does the job better. The general medical services do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">The changes to the drugs refund scheme will be the difference between getting or not getting an inhaler for an asthmatic costing perhaps €6. People will end up in hospital if they cannot buy an inhaler. So much for value for money. One day in hospital would pay for two patients' medical cards, including their drug costs, for an entire year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">Cervical screening is of proven value. A so-called pilot scheme operating for the past two or three years was supposed to roll out nationally, including a cervical smear for a GMS patient every five years at a cost of €40, but it has not happened. BreastCheck, which could cut the death rate in this area by 20%, is the greatest scandal of all. Some 650 women who die from breast cancer annually should not do so. A sum of €6 million was needed to allow this to proceed but has not been made available. That is breast apartheid of the highest order and it is worrying that it is happening, especially as it is countrywide and not just in the west. It needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Deputy Lenihan spoke about consultants. It is not consultants but the lack of them that is the problem, as is the lack of a long-term view from the Department of Finance. A plan for the future is needed but there will not be one because it would cost money. The health strategy should be consigned to the dustbin. Mayo General Hospital is a good example. It is short 60 nurses and awaits orthopaedic surgeons, rheumatology consultants  and urology consultants. It has 57 beds lying vacant and they cannot be used because there are not enough nurses or consultants. That includes 33 orthopaedic beds, 12 geriatric assessment beds and 12 paediatric assessment beds. It is terrible to think that 57 empty beds cannot be used while people wait on trolleys. The health service is totally illogical.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">The secret is more consultants not less, but this need has been blocked by the Department of Finance. The number of consultants needed was not even mentioned in the health strategy but they are needed at the front line to give value for money. The waiting list initiative is the greatest con ever. Some 100,000 people were not included on that waiting list assessment. It takes no account of what is happening. The appointment of more consultants in local areas is needed instead of supporting private health systems at home and abroad. Why not appoint a consultant to the urology department at Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar? Many people wait five years, and must get up five times a night, before getting an operation that takes 20 minutes. There is no logic to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">Mayo General Hospital has a department with two processors that do not work; one has been used for parts for the other, which is out-of-date and some 15 years old. Hundreds of people must travel from Mayo to Galway for barium meal examinations, a test that any hospital worth its salt could do. The staff in Mayo General Hospital are totally demoralised because of obsolete equipment. It costs €100,000 to replace a processor but it has not happened. For the past year, a machine for barium meal examinations was closed down by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland because it was deemed unsafe. The hospital has been waiting a year for the go ahead from the Department of Health and Children to get a new machine. The carer's allowance is still means tested. If those carers were not able to do that work, the State would be unable to take their place let alone pay for the work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">A mammogram machine is being used to process X-rays which means that mammograms cannot be processed. Women waiting for screening cannot be dealt with because there is no BreastCheck. Even those with cancer cannot get screened. It is a terrible indictment of our system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">Rheumatology will not happen either due to the embargo. People with rheumatoid arthritis and children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis cannot get treatment. Medical knowledge says that after two weeks with arthritis, joints are irreparably damaged but people must wait four years for a first appointment. There are more rheumatologists in Croatia than here. There is just one rheumatologist for counties Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim, Limerick and Clare. I worked in that unit 25 years ago and the only thing that has changed since then is that the consultant has retired due to overwork. It is a disgraceful situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">I do not know how anybody can say the health services are in a proper state because they are in a shambles. The Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance must answer for that. Although we have more investment in our health service than England, we have longer waiting lists. It is time to reform the health service. The duplication of health boards and their functions must be addressed, but the Government does not have the courage to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1135">Are we closer to Boston or Berlin? We are closer to Boston. In the 1980s a band, The, The, had a hit with a song called "Heartlands". The chorus had a line, "This is the 51st state of the USA", which referred to Thatcher's Britain in the 1980s. However, it could just as easily refer to the Ireland of the 2000s. We are closer to the USA than we are to Berlin. The US has many great things, but it also has the highest levels of poverty and inequality. Is that what we want? Do we want the social European model or the highs and lows of the US model? Unfortunately, the Government is wedded to outmoded Thatcherite policies. It has been in power for so long it thinks it is royalty. I hope the Minister for Finance, Bonnie Prince Charlie, is watching this debate on the monitor because I have a message for him. He is more like King Richard in "Richard III"– a horse, a horse, my budget for a horse breeder. There is more money being given to horse breeders than to pensioners. There is something wrong in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">The special savings investment scheme will take more money away from the Government than any investment in social welfare. There is something wrong with that. I alluded to that in my speech last night. It is an ideological problem. As Deputy Healy said, there is enough money in this country if it was invested properly. There is also a case to be made for borrowing to invest in capital infrastructure. I will make positive suggestions which may help the Government to loosen itself from the shackles of the voodoo economics it has practised in recent years. I have already accused the Taoiseach of practising voodoo economics, which means robbing from tomorrow to pay for today. There is a social and environmental cost for every activity in which the Government engages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">While the balance sheet might look healthy in some respects, society is suffering in terms of a lack of prison spaces and proper housing estates. People have shut themselves away from their communities and barricaded themselves against the riff-raff or scumbags. People from the most deprived areas must put up with the worst excesses of drug addiction, poverty and hardship. The budget follows a flawed ideological choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">As a Green Party Member, I do not want to continue to snipe. I want to make positive suggestions about what the Minister could do this year and next year. As regards oil and energy, instead of kowtowing to oil exploration companies off the west coast, we should use the technology we have,  which would be more cost-effective, to produce Ireland's electricity needs through a combination of wind and wave power. I was looking at an interesting website recently – www.aircar.com – which highlighted the development by a French entrepreneur of a car which runs on compressed air and produces clean energy. There is the potential to run environmentally clean cars in this country. The former Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Gormley, asked what was the point in accepting a Volvo when a Volkswagen Golf could be run on rape seed oil produced in County Carlow. We have the potential to develop a sustainable green society by using our resources. If we produce electricity, our energy bills will be lower.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">Cost is important. The multinationals to which we are kowtowing by giving them a reduction in corporation tax will leave this country as soon as eastern Europe or Asia offers them a lower cost economy. How can we achieve a lower cost economy? We can achieve it by building more affordable housing. People clamour for wage increases because they cannot afford to buy a house on an average income. A couple will struggle to buy a house. The Minister decided to abolish the first-time buyer's grant and to put VAT on building materials. However, a better way to get revenue would be to tax land speculation. It might not help Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael or big business donors, but it would help to get more affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">As regards the tax regime, the Green Party would like the introduction of more eco taxes to encourage a more sustainable society. In that context, does it make sense to load PRSI on employers? Employers' PRSI is a tax against job creation. VRT is a tax on the ownership, not the usage of a vehicle. Every person can own and run a car, but they should pay for the mileage, not for the privilege of owning it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">As regards the health care system, there is scope for locally based clinics to carry out procedures at a fraction of the cost to major hospitals, particularly accident and emergency departments. This is topical given what happened in Monaghan in the past 24 hours. Monaghan was designated as a hub. Many other towns could be designated as health care hubs. It would improve costs if money was taken away from the bigwigs in an inefficient and bureaucratic health care system. There are too many health boards. One efficient health board would be more beneficial to the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">As regards investment by multinationals, we have the second lowest research and development investment in the European Union. Finland, which is of similar size to Ireland, has the highest level of investment. The Finns are on the pig's back, while Ireland depends on the largesse of multinational companies which would pull out tomorrow if it was not in their economic interest. We are better than that. This country is an economic enterprise. We should use our skills in conjunction with multinational companies.  Enterprise, particularly involving the people, should be encouraged. If we do not educate and care for the most vulnerable in our society, we will pay for it in terms of our society and environment. It is cheaper to pay for it now than to pay for it in 20 years time.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1143">The budget lacked a long-term strategy or, if it had one, it was to ensure that the poor got poorer, while the Government's friends in IBEC and the horse industry got richer. That is evident from the cuts in the budgets of Shannon Development, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards. Who will help to create jobs in the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">We had a boom in recent years, but businesses have pocketed the profits and left a lack of funds for essential services, such as health. This attack on our health service began a number of years ago. Approximately 20% of acute beds were taken out of the system between 1987 and 1989. That trend of cuts continues today. Why is our health service in such a shambles? Is it because the so-called representative bodies are calling the shots or because it suits the Government to make it look like that? Earlier today I heard the Minister for Health and Children say in the House that we cannot ride roughshod over the consultant bodies. Surely the Government is allowing such bodies to ride roughshod over the people. The consequence is that babies are dying in places like Monaghan and Louth. The situation, rather than improving, is getting considerably worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">All this talk about representative bodies is a smoke screen to hide the lack of will on the part of the Government to arrange for a proper health care service for the people of this State. Members opposite can be as smart as they like, but they should look at what happened in Monaghan yesterday morning. In County Louth a child died in late April because the maternity services were closed down to save money while this Government was letting IBEC and the horsey people of this world off the hook. They could easily have financed those life-saving services. Another example is of a young girl whose waters broke as she travelled by public bus 30 miles to a maternity hospital. The driver had to keep the passengers who wanted to get off the bus on it, while he passed others who were waiting by the road. He had to convert a public bus into an ambulance to deliver this young, expectant mother to the hospital in an attempt to save her child. I do not see the compassion needed to end this on the other side of the House. It is certainly not evident in this budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">It is heart rending that the Monaghan case should happen at this particular time of year. It is reminiscent of the story of Bethlehem when Mary called at the inn, but there were no facilities for her. Over 2,000 years ago, Mary was lucky that her baby survived, but for that family in Monaghan, Christmas will be a sad time from now on. There will be no celebration of the nativity. The  consequences will be felt for a long time to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">There should be no more passing of the buck to consultants and health boards. This Parliament is charged with the responsibility of governing the State, yet the Minister for Health and Children tells us this is a difficult problem with which he cannot deal. There is a report, there is an inquiry, but there is no solution. As long as there is no solution other children will die in Louth, Monaghan and other parts of the State where cutbacks which have been made for purely financial reasons deny people the essential health services to which they are entitled. I wonder how any Member from the Government parties can be proud of a health service that was better in rural Ireland 30 years ago than it is today. Those Members will be aware of the state of the economy then and of the difficulties people had which forced them to struggle hard or to emigrate. Is that a record of which to be proud? Who is gaining from this so-called improvement of the economy? It is certainly not pregnant women in Louth and Monaghan, to name but two areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">Throughout the 1990s and into this decade, business has got yearly tax cuts, but workers have not. Business pays the lowest tax levies in the economy, but the Government could not find the money to pay for the child benefit increases it promised. It also failed to fulfil its promise to take all of the low paid out of the tax net. People on the minimum statutory wage are still being taxed. Does that mean the minimum statutory wage is too great or too small? We were promised that they would be taken out of the tax net, but they were not. Corporation taxes—</p>

          <p eId="para_1182">Despite well documented financial difficulties, I have been able to obtain funding for the ongoing improvement of services for older people in 2003. The funding will be used to meet the increased costs of the extra number of applicants to the nursing home subvention scheme. It will also help to increase the level of home help services and provide for the operation of new day care centres. Increased funding will be provided to voluntary organisations which play an invaluable role in supporting older people and the specialty-led services will be enhanced. There will be improved services nationally for dementia and Alzheimer's patients and the recommendations contained in Protecting our Future, the report of the working group on abuse of the elderly, will be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">This report, which I launched last week, outlines the minimum infrastructure and training requirements as well as legislative changes needed to address the issue of abuse of the elderly. I am particularly pleased that I am able to indicate to the House that I have secured over €800,000, just short of €1 million, in funding to commence the implementation of this report in 2003. When I telephoned one of the medical personnel involved today to advise him, he was pleased and somewhat surprised that the funding was being provided so soon as the report was launched last month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">I regard the foregoing as a significant contribution towards the improvement of services for older people. These steps represent a practical demonstration of the Government's commitment in this regard. Supporting older people must continue to be a core priority of Government. The Fianna Fáil led Government has delivered record increases in pensions and there has also been much progress in developing new care services and extending entitlement to free GP care and other free schemes for those of 70 years of age and over.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">It is stated in the Programme for Government that we will implement a co-ordinated programme of measures so that the full range of issues of concern to older people are addressed. Progress is being made across the range of Government Departments. To allow for the maximum impact to be achieved across the range of the Department and service providers, I established an interdepartmental working group to develop an action plan to increase accessibility to services. I have entered into a comprehensive consultation process on the impact of policy and on the lives of older people. The stakeholders concerned acknowledge and welcome the progress being made in a relatively short period. I will use this process in conjunction with the working group to develop an older person's strategy, a document in which older people can have a sense of shared ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">I listened with interest to what the four previous speakers had to say about our health services. I will put a few matters on record because I believe no other Government in the history of the State can match our record. Let us look at one figure alone. This year we will have spent approximately €8.2 billion on health services. When Members of the Opposition had the opportunity to put the money where their mouth is, they spent less than £3 billion. Were they innovative and creative? Did they invest in a treatment purchase fund? No.</p>

I want to compare the record of the parties opposite so that we can see how they failed when they had the opportunity to improve the lives of older people. The average pension increase under the rainbow Government was €3, under Fianna Fáil it is just over €10. The rainbow Government increased pensions in percentage terms by 4% above inflation. Between 1997 and this budget, pensions have increased by almost 40% above inflation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1216">Ireland is an island but our economy is affected by global events for job creation, economic growth, competitiveness and social justice and we must manage it n a prudent way. We now have changed economic circumstances at home, an ongoing slowdown and uncertainty abroad but the budget of 2003 has taken all these realities into account. The budgets of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, from 1997 to 2001 have ensured that Ireland has become the  envy of Europe. This budget will consolidate the gains made during those years and provide the foundation for future gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">We have the fastest growing economy in the EU, unemployment is at an all time low, people have more money in their pockets and emigration has been eliminated. This Government has done more than any other in the history of the State to support the disadvantaged and to promote social inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">It does no harm to remind ourselves of the situation from 1983 to 1987 when a Fine Gael Minister last brought in a budget to the House. Under his stewardship we had a top income tax rate of 65%. Today, the top rate is 42%. The standard rate then was 35% but today it is 20%. We had an income tax levy of 1% which has been abolished. We also had corporation tax of 50%. During that period 50,000 people left the country in despair each year. The outlook for the country was bleak and the only answer was to borrow and spend. Virtually all income tax receipts went towards serving the national debt and Government policies had increased unemployment from 170,000 to 240,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">I have listened with interest to comments from the other side of the House but they have not offered any proposals as to how to divide the financial cake other than suggest that we should borrow more and increase the national debt. Some future Government would have to inflict more taxation on the people to pay that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">The objectives of this budget are to secure stable public finances, to invest for return to better growth and to protect the weaker sections of society. No Government likes to have to make unpopular decisions. However, we all know that at the present time the nations of the world are all suffering a downturn in their economies. Here in Ireland we are no different. The major thrust of our programme is to try and maintain the great strides of the past five years. This is one of six budgets introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. To get a clear picture of where we are coming from and our plans for the future growth of the nation all six must be taken together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">In the social area, the old, the young, taxpayers and others have benefited from the actions and plans of this Administration. Progress can be seen in every city, town and street across the country and we now find ourselves among the better off nations of the world. This has come about over the short period since we achieved nationhood. Many of our social achievements are taken for granted, for example, free travel, free telephone rental and free television licences. These are benefits for those who over the years helped to build a nation that is the envy of many larger nations.</p>

          <p eId="para_1222">As a former music teacher, I am delighted Deputy Gogarty managed to do something I have not succeeded in doing. I managed to get music mentioned in every debate I  contributed to on the education committee but I never managed to get music into the Chamber. I congratulate the Deputy, perhaps not on his singing, but on his effort to raise the issue of the arts in the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">However, what I hear on this debate is something between "Hey Big Spender" and "Oliver – never before has a boy wanted more."  I came to the House at the time of the rainbow coalition. At the time one did not expect to get anything and one got nothing. People are complaining now about the increase of €8 a month for child benefit. At that time £1 a month was given, and even at that stage it would not have bought a Mars bar. Perhaps the medical people here might say we should not be buying Mars bars.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">People's expectations grow when there is proper investment in people and services, as has been happening through reductions in taxation and the injection of cash into child benefit. With the growth in expectations delivery becomes important. We are at that point now. We have had increases of £25 and €30 but now like Oliver people want more. However, €8 compared to £1 is quite a substantial increase. We must continue to deliver on our policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">The first year the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, delivered his budget he was laughed at when he said it was the first of five. The laugh was not as loud on the second and even less loud on the third. By the time he delivered the fourth and fifth budgets the Opposition had nothing to laugh at. Again, this is the first of five. People have come out with the same old rhetoric and talk about lies and promises reneged on but let them look back at the beginning of the last five years. Then, the programmes we proposed for three to five year cycles were derided. People did not believe in them. Let those people point now to what was not delivered. They will find little at which to point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">At a time when global economies are slowing down it is important that we cut our cloth to the measure. One of the important matters, besides the health services, that must be dealt with is the value for money aspect of what we spend. I doubt any country puts as much money into the health services as we do. People need to see a return for that money and that issue must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">The Opposition wants to spend more and more but does not say from where the money is to come. However, when the matter of creating revenue is raised all it can say is, "No."  This spend/save double talk is impossible. We cannot compensate anybody and everybody and at the same time expect to have money over to deal with priorities. The priorities for the Opposition were not the elderly or the less well-off but Eircom shareholders, taxi men and other generic groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">A comment was made about the elderly. Over the period of the election people said to me, "Life begins at 70."  That attitude was created by the last Government and by the support it gave to the elderly. It put money directly where people  deserved it. The elderly and the less well-off remain our priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">I could go through the aspects of the budget which I welcome. I welcome the fact that petrol prices did not increase. That is particularly important in my constituency. Like most Border counties we have a better situation on one side of the Border than on the other. I want our petrol stations to be competitive and I do not want petrol prices to rise or consumers to be penalised through price increases. Even though petrol taxes have not gone up, they did go up in some stations. I commend those stations that have brought their petrol prices down to almost a national average.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">That the dormant account money is to be put into projects focusing on children with learning disabilities is important. I welcome the measures regarding broadband as it is important to invest in infrastructure. Investment in infrastructure creates a better environment for job creation. I am disappointed I have not enough time to discuss the good elements of this budget. Some aspects of it may offend people but in this climate it is impossible to please everybody.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDennehy" eId="spk_665">
          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_1231">Budget time is the time for looking ahead but it is also time for looking at the record of the Minister over the past year. The record of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is most impressive. The Opposition seems to be making a convoluted criticism. It accepts without argument the economic success of the country over the past five years but insists that the Minister had nothing to do with it. Although it now accepts there is a downturn internationally, it blames the Minister for Ireland's position. The fact is that the Minister's policies were the cornerstone of our success over the past five years. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was first in taking a multi-annual approach to national budgeting, which was central to our success. Previous Ministers confined themselves to worrying about the 12 months to come. It is essential to take an orderly, long-term approach on major issues such as taxation. The €5 billion which was given back to taxpayers was part of a properly orchestrated plan over a five year period of Government. The same positive, logical approach was also followed on all other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">On many occasions over a four year period as Government Whip on the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I heard the Minister very ably outlining and defending his long-term objectives in debate with a battery of Opposition finance spokespersons, including the late Deputy Jim Mitchell. In the final outcome, he was always proven right in taking the long-term view and demonstrating the logic of that position on many issues, such as the level at which the Irish punt should be pitched in relation to the euro. When left without any effective ammunition, Opposition spokespersons fell back on the assertion that Deputy McCreevy was just lucky as  a Minister. I am reminded of a famous golfer who retorted to a similar comment by remarking that the more he practised, the luckier he became. The secret of Deputy McCreevy's success as Minister for Finance is sheer hard work, commitment and long-term vision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">The economic assumptions underlying the budget are cautious but realistic. That is appropriate, reflecting the Minister's belief that economic circumstances have become more difficult, especially for those in the more exposed sectors. Clearly, this budget was framed with a social partnership arrangement in mind. I welcome the positive approach of trade union executives in their initial discussions about entering negotiations on such an agreement. Ireland has benefited greatly from the partnership approach and long may that continue if an agreement can be reached. No doubt there will be a campaign against a partnership agreement by certain militants and dissident groups who pursue a different agenda from that of the majority of Irish people. I recall anti-tourist slogans being painted on roads some years ago and I believe civil disruption and unemployment were also part of that agenda. I hope the case for a national partnership agreement will prevail. A Fianna Fáil led Government introduced the first such agreement and I hope that approach will continue. According to a recent article in <i>Business and Finance,</i> the average Irish household will spend approximately €1,400 in the run up to Christmas. That gives the lie to the pessimists who claimed that the gloom over a cooling economy would damage the retail trade beyond recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">Our educational system is among the best in the world. The Government's commitment to primary education services is without parallel. Since 1997, 2,900 additional teaching posts have been created in primary schools. In the special educational needs area, the Government's ongoing commitment is evidenced by the fact that the number of special resource teachers supporting children with special needs in ordinary primary schools will have grown from approximately 100 at the end of 1998 to over 2,200 by the end of this year. Those facts and figures have not been as well publicised as they should be. The number of special needs assistants in the primary schools system will have increased from 300 to 3,800 full time and a further 1,000 part-time assistants over the same period. Since 1998, the number of learning support remedial teachers has increased from 1,302 to 1,531 and related funding has increased from €5 million to €19 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">Some €43 million is allocated to special transport services, of which €4.4 million is for the employment of escorts in special schools. I recall campaigning in the mid 1980s for a very small number of escorts on buses for children with special needs. At that time, the basic concept was not accepted, the State would not pay for it and it was left to volunteers to look after those children. Funding for special equipment for children with special needs has risen from €635,000 to €3.2 mill ion. I am glad those improvements have been provided from the largesse which this country has enjoyed over the past five years. I commend the budget and compliment the Minister for Finance on the excellent job he has done over those years. I expect he will continue in that mode over the next five years.</p>

I confirm Deputy Dennehy's experience regarding difficulties in securing support for children with special needs in the mid 1980s. That was one of the consequences of his party's 1977 budget which sold this country down the Swanee. Fianna Fáil has four or five spin-doctors or press officers in each Department. Deputy Dennehy will be conscious of having to compete with his constituency colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, who has five or six people working in his constituency office. Deputy Callanan has to contend with a similar situation in the constituency office of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy. I assume the Minister of State at the Department of Finance also has constituency office staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_1238">Perhaps that is a reflection of the Minister's personal efforts in his constituency. Some of the comments from the Government side in this debate indicated a state of collective amnesia. Deputy Keaveney spoke of silence from the Opposition in relation to recent budgets. In contrast to the noisy support on the Government side, we realised that the Minister for Finance was in the process of frittering away a surplus of €4.8 billion. I recall the scenes on the plinth opposite Leinster House on budget nights. The individualisation issue created a stir. Earlier this year, the term "rudderless" was bandied about and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was brought to Killarney to set him back on the straight and narrow. However, all of that now appears to have been forgotten. In 1997, when the rainbow Government had the opportunity to do what the Fianna Fáil led Government did in 2002 by selling the country down the Swanee, it chose not to do so. Perhaps if that course had been taken in 1997, we would be sitting on the other side of the House today but, as usual, we put the country first, an approach which is often politically unprofitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">When I first stood for election in 1997, I did an interview with East Coast Radio in Rocky Valley, Bray. On the same occasion, the then Senator Roche, now Minister of State, Deputy Roche, announced his proposed amendment to the Finance Bill to designate Bray in terms of seaside resort status. He delivered a vitriolic lecture on the failure of Deputies from the then Government parties to do anything about that matter. I am not quite sure how many budgets the present  Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has introduced since then—</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_1241">—but I still await, with bated breath, the seaside status designation for Bray. I admire the flamboyance of this Government, especially Fianna Fáil, in launching documents and projecting an air of confidence. It is very good at talking about doing things. I will quote one interesting statistic. The national development plan which was launched almost three years ago is 62% over budgeted cost and running two years behind time. A national spatial strategy was recently launched, a year too late. There is no provision for it in the budget and, clearly, it will not be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">I want to raise a number of points on agriculture with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon. I am sure the Minister for Finance will introduce a replacement for the stock relief which runs out for farmers on 31 December 2002. He did not allude to it in the budget but I am sure it will be in the Finance Bill as a pay-off. Deputy Parlon knows how important it is to put tax incentives in place for farmers leasing land. One of the difficulties with farming is the lack of land available for farmers who want to expand. While there is a tax incentive scheme, it is not attractive enough with the band allowances and age limits to entice people to lease their land. I hope the Minister of State will address it because it will not ultimately cost the Exchequer as land is mostly under-utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">I have been having a go at the Minister of State in recent days about roll-over tax relief. He built his reputation on it so I do not know what he is going to do now. There is a great deal on his shoulders but I expect him to secure an exemption for people who are subject to compulsory purchase orders. I have no difficulty with capital gains tax for people who willingly dispose of an asset but those who do not should get compensation for their inconvenience. I do not know how the Minister of State will do this but I am sure his special relationship with the Minister for Finance will see him through.</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_1250">He is easy to provoke this evening. I am glad he has nailed his colours to the mast that he is happy with 20% capital gains tax. I admire him for taking that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">I have a certain admiration for the Minister for Finance but I listened to Deputy Lenihan describe him as having left-wing policies. The reason Fianna Fáil did so well in the general election – although Deputy Michael D. Higgins may not like to hear it – is that Deputy McCreevy had many right-wing policies which appealed to the electorate. It is amazing that the Government can espouse left-wing rhetoric while implementing right-wing policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">I am glad the overall personal tax take, which was 45% in 1997, has been reduced to 40% in 2002 and the discretionary tax taken from that has increased by an almost equal level. That is good but I have difficulties with the Government doing so by stealth. It decides to retain the 20% and 40% tax rates and 20% capital gains tax but, in order to do so, it has to put levies on houses in local authority areas, increase car tax and every other relief for people is taken away. That is the price we have to pay. I have no difficulty with the road the Government is taking but I find the policy dishonest because the tax rates are presented without elaborating on the commensurate difficulties people experience through local authorities as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">Deputy Dennehy spoke about the economy being in difficult times. We have never said this in Fine Gael. The economy is not going as well as it was but it is not in difficult times. Our difficulty is the way the public finances have been managed – for self-promotion, self-gain and self-advancement among the electorate at the cost of the State. Where has the surplus of €4.8 billion in 2000 gone? Some 50,000 extra people have been taken on in the public service which is acceptable if people can see a commensurate improvement in works and services. We are continually told about funding in health having been trebled but it has only improved services in some areas. In areas in which I have experience, such as orthodontic treatment and waiting lists, it has not improved. I do not want to be a kill-joy with constant negative comments, but that is a fact of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">The Minister for Finance spoke yesterday about a new fiscal management which I hope he implements rigidly. I want to see money that is allocated to Departments and local authorities being returned if it is not spent within a certain timeframe on specific projects. I do not know what happens to money allocated for specific projects. The Government says it will invest in infrastructure and the concept of public private partnership. The second Bacon report drove investors out of the market and a great deal of money that had been invested in property at home was moved abroad. Policy was changed after the third  Bacon report and the money came back in but I want to see if an incentive could be created to use that money to get the investor out of the housing market and let them invest in infrastructural projects as opposed to housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">I echo Deputy Penrose's comments about widows and widowers under 66 having been totally neglected. We also need to follow up on the loss of film industry tax relief which has been so important to Bray and County Wicklow and I am sure Deputy Higgins will speak about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1256">A budget is a time to reflect on what has happened and will happen. It is a drawing together of the wisdom of the Government, their views and how people should be treated in the years ahead. In the light of this budget, we must examine how sectors of our community will benefit or, as I believe, be worse off in the next 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">Deputy Callely spoke about older people and made great play of the Government's plans for the elderly but the reality is that many of our older people are in nursing homes which need more attention from the Government and the Department of Health and Children. To really look after older people in nursing homes – an increasing number of them will be housed there – we need dedicated staff who will form an inspectorate to include public health doctors and nurses which could examine what is happening in our nursing homes day after day. The vast majority of them are excellent but a significant minority of them are not. If the Minister for Finance really wants to care for the elderly he should introduce legislation to provide for an inspectorate, separate from the health boards, to investigate conditions in all these premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">Will more people be eligible for medical cards as a result of this budget or fewer? It is a deep injustice that people who are ill in the North-Eastern Health Board area and are unfortunate enough to suffer from cancer, do not have an automatic entitlement to a medical card.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_1260">If this Government cared for people, it would provide medical cards to people with long-term illnesses. Cancer is the most serious disease to fight, yet patients in Counties Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan receiving treatment do not have an automatic entitlement to a medical card and this puts a great strain on people. I believe they are entitled to it and that it is a fundamental right. They do not have that right under this Government, which is a shame and a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">If a person's income is such that they cannot benefit from a medical card, they now have to pay €70 under the refund of drugs scheme after the Government introduced a dreadful increase on the eve of the budget. A few years ago the figure was £42 but now, under Deputy McCreevy, it is €70. People who are not on the list of long- term illnesses will pay more. The sicker they are, the more frequently they must visit the doctor and receive prescriptions for medicine. Under Fianna Fáil they will pay more because it is effectively a tax on illness. The sicker the person the more they must pay, but where is the justice, fairness, equity and balance in that? There is none.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">The local authority housing lists comprise many people who cannot afford to buy their own homes. Since 1997, when Fine Gael was last in Government, house prices have doubled or trebled. Married couples with no children are almost totally committed financially to repaying their mortgages. Under this Government there is no price control on housing and worse still is the fact that the poor cannot obtain local authority housing. In a year's time there will be a lot more people on the local authority housing list in the Minister's constituency. That is because the Government is cutting back on housing. The local government Estimates, which have been presented to the House, contain a significant cutback on the housing allocation. The Government is making poor people pay for what they are doing. People with two or three children who are entitled to a house will wait longer to get the home they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">During the past year, Louth County Council has abolished the disabled person's grant. Disabled people who require a downstairs bedroom or an extension due to arthritis or heart disease cannot apply for the relevant grant because the necessary funding has not been provided. The Government is making sick, elderly and disabled people pay for their policies. It is shameful that such a situation has been allowed to arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">A low income couple wishing to buy a home in Drogheda can not obtain a loan under the shared ownership scheme because it has been discontinued. I have brought that matter to the attention of the Minister.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_1266">While the decision to discontinue the scheme was not political, it is nonetheless disgraceful and unacceptable. It makes a mockery of the pomposity and arrogance we are hearing from the Government benches.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">Social welfare increases are welcome, particularly the Government's commitment to increase the old age pension, which is an honourable policy. However, according to figures provided by Drogheda Corporation poor people cannot obtain local authority housing. Five years ago, when the previous Government took office, there were 300 people on the corporation's housing list. Some 600 families are on the list today and the waiting time is increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">This Government is capping rent allowances so poor people will be living in worse accommodation conditions. Some accommodation is rat infested and does not have proper toilet and bathroom facilities, or even hot water. By failing to provide adequate rent allowances, the Govern ment is condemning poor people to live in unacceptably low standards of housing and hygiene.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">Much has been said about assisting people to avail of education and remedial teachers, such as Deputy Keaveney, have contributed to the debate. I am a remedial teacher and taught for many years in a school. I rang that school today to ask how things were going and I was told that the main issue is the social needs of deprived children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. They are not getting the attention and support they need. Wonderful work has been done through community employment schemes in Drogheda, including a breakfast club for children on their way to school. They can get lunch later in the day and also have a homework study club in the evenings. Unfortunately, however, the FÁS community employment schemes that have been providing those essential first-class facilities are being cut to ribbons by the Government which is scrapping them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1283">Five or six years ago, an extension was promised for Ennis General Hospital. The last I heard was that it was going to design stage but when I raised it with the Minister he said it will depend on the funding available. He will know early in the new year. It looks as if that may not go ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">Earlier today, we heard about a serious problem that occurred last night at Monaghan General Hospital when a young expectant mother was transferred to Cavan Hospital. The child was born <i>en route</i> but died at Cavan Hospital shortly afterwards. We have a similar situation in Clare where the maternity hospital was closed in the 1980s. Expectant mothers from west Clare now have to travel up to 90 miles to Limerick to give birth. The Mid-Western Health Board, however, is closing down the maternity hospital in Limerick and is building a new extension in Dooradoyle where the centre of excellence is located. Therefore, expectant mothers from Clare will have to cross Limerick city making their journey even more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">Funding for non-national road infrastructure has been cut back 27% and public transport charges have risen by 15%. All those dramatic cuts were contained in the Estimates, which have put further pressure on families. The National Development Plan, 2001-2006, is currently 62% over budget and running two years behind schedule. It is estimated that road building projects that were supposed to cost over €9 billion during the life of the plan, will cost €15.9 billion. The Ennis bypass is a casualty of that. Last year it was estimated to cost €140 million, but current estimates put the cost at €150 million. When will work on it commence? The Government should have borrowed money for infrastructure which is important. The Ennis by-pass is a key project for the development of Shannon Airport and the west coast. It is estimated that the cost involved will run to €200 million by the time the project starts. If it had commenced it could have been provided for in the current budget. The Minister said in his budget speech that PPPs are the way forward so it seems tolling of our roads will also be the way forward.</p>

Deputies can ignore the realities, domestically and internationally, but the budget was drawn up against some difficult economic situations. Like elsewhere in Europe, the Government is facing budgetary pressures on a number of fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">Since the mid-1990s, our economy has experienced successive years of strong growth, exceptional by any standards in the world.

          <p eId="para_1331">The international climate is tough with many economies doing little more than treading water. The European Commission now estimates that GDP growth in the euro area will be no more than 0.8% this year and that economies such as Germany will register only marginal positive growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">It is against this background that our performance must be judged. Real GNP will be modest this year and is estimated to expand by 1.8%. Similar to other countries, the slower than expected growth has had an impact on our budgetary position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">Going forward, unfortunately the prospects on the international markets do not look so wonderful. The general view is that we will begin to pick-up in the second half of 2003 but even that is far from certain. Euro area growth of 1.8% is expected and the US is forecast to grow by 2.3%. Against this climate, Ireland is forecast to grow modestly next year. Real GDP is forecast to expand by 3.5%, with the prospects improving over the following years. The economy is forecast to grow at 5% in GDP terms by 2005 and GNP is forecast to grow by 2.25% next year, picking up to 3.75% by 2005. With good policies we can build the economy slowly and get back on track rather than going down hill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1335">We have lost competitiveness in recent years. Our priority must be to halt this slide and regain our position. Competitiveness creates jobs and wealth and generates the resources needed to build the type of society we all want. There was a lot of talk by the last three Deputies about what would be wonderful about society and the difficulties in regard to poverty that still exists. The greatest antidote to poverty is a real job. The fact that our unemployment rate is almost the lowest in Europe and one of the lowest throughout the world is the answer to poverty, which is the direction in which we must keep going.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">Clearly the need to moderate our cost base to ensure we do not suffer further is a task for all the social partners. The Government will endeavour to reach the best possible outcome in the current negotiations for a successor to the national pay agreement and on the implementation of the recommendations of the public service benchmarking body. In regard that body, the Minister has sensibly provided for the cost of the implementation of the first phase, should agreement be achieved. This will cost €565 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">Over the past five years, the Government parties have demonstrated their commitment to improving public services, and are continuing to do so. Since 1997, and taking account of what the Minister is planning for 2003, total gross spending, capital and current, will have increased from under €19 billion to more than €38 billion, an increase of 102%. In that time, total health spending will have increased by €5.2 billion to €8.9 billion; total education spending will have increased by €2.5 billion to €5.6 billion; social welfare spending will have increased by €4.5 billion to €10.2 billion, which has been recognised by some Opposition Deputies; and spending on infrastructure will have increased by €2 billion to almost €5.6 billion. The Government is continuing to provide substantial funding in 2003 for these key priority areas. As everyone knows, we must keep spending consistent with available resources, of which there is a limited pool. This  means we must prioritise and, if one sector receives more, others must receive less.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">We committed ourselves in the Agreed Programme for Government to implementing a wide range of social inclusion policies aimed at supporting the most vulnerable in society. Despite the greater pressures on public finances this year, we must direct resources to those most in need. I would like to remind Deputies of a few important changes in terms of pensions. The old age and related pensions will increase by €10 per week. We have heard much about what the €10 will mean per day and per week, but it amounts to €157 per week. The old age non-contributory pension has increased to €144 per week. This is the first step in honouring our commitment to increase this amount of €200.</p>

          <p eId="para_1340">If the same rate of increase is maintained for the lifetime of the Government we will reach the rate of €200 per week referred to when the Government took office in 1997, which was Utopia as far as most pensioners were concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">In keeping with the spirit of protecting the less well off, this year's budget has also provided for a special increase in widow's and widower's contributory pension. The weekly rate of payment in 2003 will rise by €11, bringing the rate to €156 and €162 per week for those aged 80 and over. We have continued to make progress in child benefit by directing support towards parents with dependent children.</p>

          <p eId="para_1343">The level of payment is being increased by €8 per month for the first and second children to €125.60. The Deputy can put that in his pipe and smoke it. They did not get it from the rainbow Government. There will be an increase of €10 per month for third and subsequent children, bringing the new rate to €157.30 per month, which is not to be scoffed at. While the Government would have liked to increase these payments by more at this stage, it is the intention to complete the planned increase in child benefit over 2004 and 2005. Other full rate social welfare payments are being increased from next month by €6 per week. The overall social welfare improvements announced in the budget will cost €530 million. The Deputy can talk about the amount per day but the Government has put aside €530 million for the increases in social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">The strength of our economy in recent years is as a result of a number of international and domestic factors. One key factor in all of this is the fundamental reform that has been made to taxation. The measures taken in recent budgets have given more people a greater say in the amount of income they enjoy. Because people are bringing  home more pay, they are prepared to work longer and harder.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">Fiscal policy is required to help create a just and fair society without hindering the development of a modern and vibrant economy. This was not a budget for taking quick fixes or postponing agreed tax measures. We have entered into a number of commitments which are being honoured. In other areas, however, the Government has sought a contribution and while people may not be happy with it, they can agree it is required for the common good. Personal tax changes, while more limited than in previous years, will take 37,400 taxpayers out of the tax net. The changes in mortgage interest tax relief will benefit over 45,000 first-time buyers this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">Smoking is a terrible social blight and I welcome the increase of 50 cent on a pack of cigarettes. I am aware that its contribution to inflation was a key element in preventing a higher increase in dreaded cigarettes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">A couple of years ago, the phased introduction of the new 12.5% rate of corporation tax was enshrined in legislation. The Government is committed to maintaining an attractive climate for enterprise and for this reason I welcome the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax to 12.5% from 1 January next as planned. This is what will keep the jobs in place. This decrease has not been introduced to benefit the rich or industrialists but to help create highly paid jobs and to keep people off the dole.</p>

          <p eId="para_1349">Difficult choices were faced on the issue of capital gains tax. The reduction in the rate in recent years from 40% to 20% has been a huge success and has seen the yield increase by over five-fold in recent years. The Minister was correct to resist the urge to increase the rate. It would have been a retrograde step back into the dark ages if we increased the rate. The changes made to the payment dates will result in a once-off gain of €250 million for the Exchequer in 2003. It will mean that the financial burden is placed earlier on people, but it is a better alternative than reverting to a 40% rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">The tax package is also challenging for farmers. A number of Opposition Deputies have claimed to be very concerned about farmers. While I welcome the fact that the existing exemption from stamp duty for the transfer of land to young trained farmers will continue for a further three years, I would be a hypocrite if I said I was not disappointed at the abolition of roll over relief for people wishing to reinvest in land.</p>

Since the budget, I have been in contact with many farmers – I will meet them again tonight – and I am satisfied that the majority of them will still receive maximum benefit from what is a very fair compensation package for the roads programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">The emphasis in this year's budget is very much based on ensuring the weaker sections of society are protected, while at the same time securing sound public finances. This budget builds on the very real gains made over the last number of years.

I intend to quote from parts of their speeches to support my proposition. Deputy Bruton seemed to be critical of the SSIA scheme, without declaring whether he would limit the scheme or scrap it altogether. Most people support the Government's commitment to long-term savers and the benefit of its approach will become evident as the years go by.</p>

          <p eId="para_1402">I welcome the budget and congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on his fair proposals. He mentioned three key objectives: to protect the weak in society; to invest in the future to position ourselves for a return to better growth levels; and to secure stable public finances to safeguard the gains we have made. He has protected the less well-off by imposing social welfare increases at a cost of €530 million, bringing the total social welfare budget to €10.2 billion, an increase of €4.5 billion since 1997. As Deputy Parlon has said, health spending has increased from €5.2 billion to €8.9 billion since 1997 and education expenditure has gone up by €2.5 billion to €5.6 billion. The funding allocated to infrastructure has been augmented by €2 billion to nearly €5.6 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">I welcome the additional allocation of €209 million for the national roads programme, meaning that the Exchequer will invest €1.25 billion in the programme next year. This funding, together with public private partnership schemes, will ensure that the necessary road developments will continue. I hope that the Loughrea bypass will be included in the roads programme. As Deputy Michael D. Higgins and others are aware, the worst bottleneck between Dublin and Galway is in Loughrea, particularly on Friday evenings when traffic in the town comes to a halt. I hope the bypass will be funded next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404">As Deputy Parlon said, the continuation for a further three years of the stamp duty exemption for the transfer of land to young, trained farmers is to be welcomed as it is very important. I also welcome the provisions made for additional mortgage interest relief for first time house buyers, which will assist 45,000 people. The prudent budget announced by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, last week will help the country to grow. The Minister could have borrowed a great deal of money to satisfy everyone's needs, but that would have brought the country back into debt and nobody wants to see that happen again. I commend the budget.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DonnieCassidyFF" eId="spk_794">
          <from>Mr. Cassidy</from>
          <p eId="para_1405">I have been a member of the Oireachtas for over 20 years and it is a great honour and privilege for me to say a few words about this budget, the first to be presented to the House since I was elected to it. The greatest priorities in this budget were maintaining the current levels of employment and, as Deputy Parlon has said, keeping us competitive. We have to stay competitive at all costs. As we all know, 20% of US investment in Europe is in Ireland. It is crucially important that we maintain such levels and keep Ireland as an attractive base for multi-nationals such as US investors. Deputies remember when interest rates were 18%. The song "Flight of Earls" by Liam Reilly summed up the plight of our young people, 50,000 of whom emigrated each year. It is wonderful to discuss a budget in the context of the return of many of the emigrants I have mentioned. Their return has added to the expertise, work ethic and skills pool of the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406">This budget takes the global economic climate into account. We all know that the world's economy has gone soft. The United States has an unemployment rate of 6% and interest rates are at an all-time low across Europe. Who would ever have thought that the cost of funds, before banks charge their margins, would be less than 3% in Europe and less than 2% in the US? It is a good time for people to invest, create jobs and invest in property. We see what has happened in the insurance sector and in the stock market where stocks may decrease by 10% or 20% overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1407">People are turning to property and this is one of the opportunities to maintain jobs in Ireland to get us over the difficult global period in the US, Europe and other markets. I ask the Minister of State to suggest to the Minster for Finance that the CE schemes, if possible, should be maintained at the same level in the CLÁR area. Deputy Ó Cuív has been doing a magnificent job fighting the cause of the people in rural Ireland where populations have declined. My area in Westmeath is one of those areas and his CLÁR programmes are of the utmost importance in bringing infrastructure like sewerage to little villages and towns which would otherwise not have a chance of getting this investment. I ask the Minister of State to request the Government to hold the CE schemes at the same level in the CLÁR area for the next two years at least.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408">It was refreshing to see on television a few nights ago what the PPP did for the new school in Tubbercurry. There is a Deputy from the area in the House. The situation is the same in every constituency, in that 400 to 500 primary schools are in urgent need of development, whether it is refurbishment or building new schools. Surely the Tubbercurry experience has to be commended and the Government should implement PPP schemes for these schools. Members from all constituencies, and the Deputy from Kildare is no different, would know of ten or 12 schools in  which this could happen over the next two or three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409">I commend what has been done for carers, but it is not enough. More should be done for carers, who are the backbone of our society. I ask the Government to make a special case in the near future so that carers are looked after better than at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1410">On the issue of decentralisation, I hope the Government will give an office to each region. There is a region in the north midlands where the only town which has not been favoured is Mullingar. I want to make the case because there is a Minister in the House who is influential in this regard. We are entitled to the same share as other towns in the north midlands. We look forward to the road construction starting from Kilcock to Athlone and Kinnegad to Mullingar. I do not want to repeat the various comments made by other speakers except to say that it is good that we are debating the budget and the progress which has been made over the past five years. Everyone knows that a little correction was needed and we will benefit from it in the future.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1411">Having listened to the speeches from the other side, Deputy Cassidy need not worry about the Minister for Finance and property. Deputy McCreevy has looked after property speculators very well, not only in this budget but in every one of his budgets. He has assisted them in tearing the heart out of the economy. He did it in his abysmal approach to capital gains tax where he threatened to deal with land holding by increasing this tax and then backed off. We see it in relation to social housing. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced today how he would bend his knee to that section of the Construction Industry Federation that went on strike against social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1412">It is interesting when Fianna Fáil, in its most recent form of being captured by the Progressive Democrats, has to deal with questions like who must wait and who must not be kept waiting. The people who must not be kept waiting are exactly the people Deputy Cassidy has been describing, those who want to invest in property or speculate in land. I am interested to also look at who must wait. One must wait for an increase in child benefit or the fuel allowance, or for any real benefit in relation to care of the elderly. There is a derisory paragraph in the budget speech in relation to the disabled. The Deputies have a cheek to speak about carers because they did not figure in the budget speech at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413">I will deal with some of the economic assumptions on which Deputy McCreevy operates. They are consistent in this respect. He represents, as Minister for Finance, the same callous indifference to the distribution of wealth and to care of people on a general basis at home as he does abroad. Before the budget, in the context of the Estimates, at a time when 30 million people in  the Horn of Africa are faced with starvation, he announced cuts in overseas development aid, humanitarian relief and emergency food aid. In these countries, such as Malawi, which pays €88 million servicing debt while education and health combined are €54 million, 1% of GDP spent on education rather than debt would save the lives of 19,000 children a day. The Minister goes to the International Monetary Fund and represents us at international institutions and does not speak about wiping out the debts of these heavily indebted poorer counties. He would not do so because of his finely-contaminated and well-marinaded influence from the Progressive Democrats who have represented, since they arrived in Irish politics, a consistent, deep politics of greed. I accept that they believe it. They believe that if one never takes tax off even the most wealthy—</p>

          <p eId="para_1417">The Progressive Democrats should tell us where the evidence is that it is their suggestion of lowering tax that has created the numbers of jobs. It is interesting again to ask about their attitude towards housing. Now that the Minister of State has reminded me, I recall that when the first version of the Estimates came out and it was announced that the first-time buyer's grant was to be abolished, the new Deputy, Deputy Grealish, closely followed by Alderman McDonnell, were first to the newspapers claiming that they would have it reversed. They suggested that they would not vote for it and would lead the rebels. Then the budget came and the tax credit substitution whereby a married couple might claw back €350 was meekly accepted by them. They find nothing wrong, not only on that issue, but on every issue relating to housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1418">There were people who owned five or ten houses in Galway city. Today they own 20 and 25. The Progressive Democrats believe in that. They believe that one should be allowed to speculate on a basic need such as housing. They believe that one should not put capital gains tax at the highest level on such activity. They believe in land hoarding and they are first to suggest at the same time, as we heard this evening, that there must be wage restraint.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">Let us calmly and unemotionally look at the economic assumptions behind the budget. The  way to look at the six budgets is to look at the process of capital accumulation alongside the increase in wages. It has, by and large under social partnership, not been that far off the CPI index. At the same time if one looks at the capital distribution one will notice that the value of the property held by people in increasingly tax-exempt areas has massively increased. One can interpret that in all sorts of ways and others have done it. It means our society is becoming deeply unequal. How would one test it going the other way, irrespective of who was in Government? One would have taken—</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1431">I want to deal with the assumptions that guided the budget. It is interesting that all the speeches we have heard so far justifying the budget have contained statements of gross figures of expenditure. Allow me to suggest a position that is rejected by the Minister for Finance when he attends the meetings of the IMF and others. We could deal with these countries  that are seeking to avoid famine by having a basic needs approach in which health, water and food are placed across a line and the performance of the economy for poverty adjustment is calculated outside these measures. This has been rejected internationally. At home, if we wanted to do the same we would specify what we wanted to spend on basic public health, water, sewerage, housing and so on, and protect people before moving to deal with features of the economy as though people did not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">I have listened very carefully to the debate and what we got was a version of a "depeopled" economy, an economy described in terms of its indicators but not broken across categories of the population. For example, if we take the gross domestic product and divide it by population over the years we will find out the distribution effect. Let us be honest: there are parties who believe that we should be working consistently towards equality in good times and bad, and there are other parties who believe that it is only when we have removed every possible restraint by way of taxation and growth is completely untrammelled and presumed to be infinite, that gradually everybody's boat will rise. Those who are of the latter view must accept the consequences and justify the approach. It is inconsistent for these people to suggest that they are somehow following an egalitarian agenda while they are asking the most vulnerable to wait and telling those who have most to give that they must not be kept waiting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433">This is what is happening in a number of key areas; I have given an example in housing already. If I am to be proved wrong in this, I challenge the Government to have a national property survey to identify who owns what. It will find, as Deputy Cassidy said, that throughout the last six budgets it has been possible under the section 23 and section 50 provisions to recycle rental income into the housing market, driving house prices up and making it more even more difficult for people to buy a home. That is not the worst problem we have with housing, however. Leaving aside those people for whom so many have spoken in relation to the first time buyer's grant, let us look at the book of Estimates from the point of view of public and social housing and the allocations given to local authorities, which have been massively cut back. The latest legislation will allow people who own land banks back into the market, making it impossible for local authorities to purchase land that may be used as a site for public housing, which has itself been cut. The Government cannot tell us that the poor have been protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434">When we come to rental income we are dealing with the most vulnerable of all. Perhaps the Minister of State will bring this point of view to the Cabinet.</p>

          <p eId="para_1436">I know that, but I am sure the Deputy meets his senior Minister occasionally.  Even in Fianna Fáil that is good practice, except when the hard-riding little squire from the suburbs was here. He did not meet his junior Ministers very often; he took them for granted. Then again, the builders always knew where to go. They did not call to us: they called to that crowd over there.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1438">I would like an answer to my point about rent allowance, which has now been capped. In Galway city, with which Deputy Grealish will become familiar in time, in every advertisement for accommodation people are looking for professional couples. It is impossible for a single person on rent allowance to find accommodation. Now, with no restraint on speculative activity in housing, rents will increase. If the rent goes over a certain amount one cannot, since 25 November, subsidise it oneself. The Western Health Board had a ceiling of €115. If one rented a bedsitter in Galway for €120, until now, one could pay the extra €5 oneself. Now, if the rent is €120 one loses all of one's rent allowance. That is monstrous. The most vulnerable of our people in the rental sector are being put at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1439">There is even less opportunity for those who are hoping for social housing, who wait five years in the Galway Corporation area if they are a family and even longer if they are single. It is impossible for people to buy a house because of the abolition of the first time buyer's grant and the increase in VAT, which adds more than €2,000 to the price of a house for a young couple. Yet all the time, more people are owning more houses and benefiting from capital accumulation at a time when there is no tax on windfall profits in land and no attempt to claw back any of that accumulation by way of capital gains. That is the colour of the Government and of the Minister's budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">I listened with great care to what people said about health care. There are many good people on all sides of the House who want better health care. At University Hospital, Galway, a radiotherapy unit will be ready next July. How does it make sense to have proceeded with that and now place a cap on the staffing necessary to bring this vital unit into use for cancer patients? Because of Deputy McCreevy's last five budgets, people have been investing in the private sickness industry. He gave them tax breaks to go into competition with the public service, poach consultants' services, break contracts that exist with the public service and make public health and accessibility to it impossible. Again, this is the colour of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1441">We could be talking about overseas development aid and our attitude to famine relief or issues at home such as the poor, housing, health or public transport. More and more people are using public transport and this is to be welcomed,  but while there is a reference in the budget to the roads programme, there is none to any deflection from the NDP towards vital bus and rail resources. This tells us again the thinking of the Government. I believe it has no mandate for this. The case has also been well made in the Estimates regarding the number of schools left in a state that is dangerous and unhealthy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442">Deputy McCreevy, the genius of six budgets, then appointed a three-man team to advise him on how to find another €900 million should it be necessary. They came up with a shopping list which can be found on page ten of the report of the independent estimates review committee. That raises the interesting question of whether the Department of Finance is losing its nerve because in the past it was always able to produce good, old fashioned, right wing rubbish internally. It has contracted that job out now to pensioners from the Department.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1454">I would like to proceed and I would like the same protection in this House that every other Member has had, including the Minister of State. If he wants to go down that road, however, so will I. I remember the circumstances  of how this Government was formed and the one previous to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1455">The review group's recommendations include reduced numbers in the Defence Forces, a review of pupil-teacher ratios, reduced compensatory allowances for farmers, further increases in third level fees, a review of the universality of child benefit and so on. In fairness to the Government, and to be accurate, it did not accept all of these, but accepted some of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1456">It is not clear yet what it rejected because the report suggests that if there is a further deterioration in the public finances, this sort of list is necessary. It then suggests a review of transport with the phasing of capital programmes over a longer period, the introduction of water charges in 2003, a reduction in the allocation for child care initiatives, a reduction in allocation for housing and further increase in the drugs refund threshold. This plan was not put into the public domain by a bleeding heart organisation, the Labour Party or Fine Gael, it is in the report of the three wise men to the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457">I listened interestingly to the notion that this is all good economics. The Minister is abolishing film relief. I was the Minister who recast the scheme in 1993. The gross spend on films in 1992 was £11.4 million. By 1996 it was £184.6 million and it had created 4,100 full-time job equivalents. Today there are 3,100 full-time job equivalents. I listened to what people had to say about making sense of investment and attracting foreign investment for job creation. The way section 481 works differs according to different categories. There is a difference between projects that come through the Irish Film Board, which the three wise men suggested should be abolished, and projects that are sold into the international market by bodies such as Ardmore Studios. In the case of the latter, taking "Reign of Fire" as an example, there was a budget of €100 million. The tax foregone was €8 million while the amount paid directly in PRSI was €12.5 million. There was a net gain immediately through section 481 on projects like that of about €4.5 million. Added to that figure is the VAT and the indirect spend. This has been tested by different bodies, including consultants to the Department of Finance who produced a report suggesting the indirect multiplier was more than 3:1.</p>
          <p eId="para_1458">It is a huge industry, capable of development and creating jobs. When the budget of a film is over €2 million, 50 skills are involved. We have crushed it when other countries are building on the Irish model. In Britain there is a sale and lease back system for films and some people use the Irish system for the early stage of production and the British for post-production and between the two systems we were getting an enormous amount of business. That is just one component. Culturally, small film makers were getting investment to enable them to establish a niche.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459">I discussed this on radio this morning with Deputy Roche and he suggested there were breaches of the tax codes. The Revenue Com missioners regard the film incentive scheme as being more tax compliant than any other. Its view of the scheme was positive. I cannot understand why the three wise men suggested the abolition of the Irish Film Board. The increase in VAT in budget also puts 1% on the price of cinema tickets and section 481 is being abolished within two years without anything to replace it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1460">That VAT increase was the meanest thing of all. Changing the basic rate of VAT by 1% brings in €245 million, although without an advisor I could be wrong – I have to rely on my own memory. It is an easy way to raise €245 million but the fundamental principle is that indirect taxation is regressive. It affects the poor and those who have to spend a much greater percentage of their income than those who are able to save from it and invest it in any one of the schemes still available or, worse still, invest it in speculative gain in property.</p>
          <p eId="para_1461">Indirect taxation has a wide take so 1% can yield this large sum but it affects coal, gas and electricity. An older person who must provide himself with fuel for the winter must now deal with a 4.8% increase of the measly allowance. He may be facing a rent increase from the local authority and, having dealt with that, will note that there will be a cap on the rent allowance while there will also be no increase in the fuel allowance. To suggest one is caring about older people by giving them as much care as one gives the single housing applicant is ludicrous.</p>

I would be happy if people were consistent about it but I have never heard in the last six years any Minister with responsibility for housing deal with the question of the rise in house prices. It was regarded by some, and probably most of those in Deputy Parlon's party, as a good thing to live in a €500,000 house. It did not seem to matter that it was driving thousands of people away from ever having a home.</p>

There are coun tries that do not call themselves a republic with good health services, public transport services, proper control of the rental sector, public housing and public parks. They do not go around telling people that the highest moral value is to hold on to your own money and to fork that money into property if its value increases and to hell with your neighbour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468">Transcendent greed is at the core of the party that has taken over Fianna Fáil. There are many decent people in Fianna Fáil who quietly say they do not want to have anything much to do with this, who are very unhappy about it and would have liked some form of increase in capital gains tax. Is it not interesting how stallions can generate millions of euro for an individual yet survive the gaze of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy? At the same time, many other people have to pay and wait. The budget is all about those who have been asked to wait and those on housing lists.</p>

          <from>Ms Hoctor</from>
          <p eId="para_1475">Gabhaim buíochas leat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as ucht na deise a thabhairt domsa, labhairt anocht faoi dúnadh na monarchan Miza i Roscré, inné. I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, on the urgent matter of job replacement in Roscrea, in view of the job losses at Miza Pharmaceuticals, Roscrea, yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_1476">A High Court decision, to the devastation of the people of Roscrea, deemed the wind up of the company, the largest employer in the town, which was in examinership for the second time in two years. Small statutory redundancy payments plus a small amount of holiday pay is all the 230 workers have to look forward to with the approach of Christmas. They are without income today and this is an appalling financial blow to the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477">If the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was in the House, I would remind her of her visit to Roscrea nearly four years ago when the town received a similar blow on the announcement of the closure of Offray. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment would recall her setting up of a task force to address the void of employment with a view to working towards establishing a replacement industry in Roscrea at that time. Within a number of months, the task force was abandoned without providing a glimmer of hope to the workforce affected. The setting up of a task force again would prove futile as there is no reason to believe that it would be helpful, in the knowledge of the poor history to date of a deficit of effective replacement industry in the view of such closures. Factory closures and redundancies are no stranger to north Tipperary, as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment well knows.</p>
          <p eId="para_1478">I recall when I, with other public representatives, met the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in Thurles with the 230 workers of the GMX Moulinex plant in May 2001 when they were informed of the closure of that 14 year old industry. A similar task force was also set up, comprising local authority officials, county enterprise board officials and Shannon Development but it was to no avail. To exacerbate the jobs loss problem further in north Tipperary, over 230 workers were laid off at Aventis Pharma, in my home town of Nenagh between April and August of this year, another devastating blow to the commercial fabric of a growing town.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479">No replacement industry has been found for these lost industries. The loss of such locally-based industries diminishes local investment in local shops and commercial entities. A town loses a sense of purpose with no clearly defined source of local income for a local spend. Worst of all, it depletes a local community of its morale and unique identity, where people work and spend locally, sustaining a healthy commercial circle of a vibrant local economy. Sadly, each of our three towns of Thurles, Nenagh and Roscrea are at a serious loss due to these factory closures in the past three years. This is serious for the three towns as none of them was given major recognition in the recent spatial strategy announced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480">I ask Deputy Ahern, who is standing in for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, what immediate remedial action the Minister intends to take to address this major issue of con cern where the closure of Miza Pharmaceuticals in Roscrea is the third industrial closure in three years in north Tipperary. In anticipation of Deputy Ahern's response, I ask that Roscrea, Nenagh and Thurles be prioritised by the Department as towns in need, serving a shared hinterland of redundant workers who over the years have proven themselves in skills and commitment to their respective employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481">I ask the Minister of State to consider this request on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and to make my request known to her, emphasising that north Tipperary has been depleted due to the closure of Miza Pharmaceuticals but has a diligent workforce. I ask that north Tipperary be once again considered among the vibrant zones of industrial development, worthy of its young, committed and highly-skilled workforce.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1482">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment and convey the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's disappointment in regard to the jobs lost in Roscrea. Miza Pharmaceuticals is a privately-owned Canadian company with headquarters in Toronto and subsidiaries in the US and the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_1483">Miza Ireland Limited was formerly known as Antigen Pharmaceuticals and employed 280 people in the manufacture of injectable products in Roscrea. Antigen was founded in 1946. I worked in the freight side of CIE some years ago and Antigen was one of its major customers. The size of the consignments may not have been that big but there were many of them and I had many dealings with the company at that time. In 2001, as a result of financial difficulties, Antigen went under examinership for some months and in November 2001, Miza Pharmaceuticals took over the manufacturing assets and business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1484">The Irish firm has debts of €22 million and went into examinership in October 2002 because a UK company, Goldshield PLC, had indicated that it would consider acquiring the Irish operation. On 2 December 2002, Goldshield decided that it would not proceed with the acquisition. Since Miza went into examinership, the IDA and the local company management have been actively promoting the facility to potential investors in the pharmaceutical industry. I understand that two overseas companies have viewed the facility in the past ten days.</p>
          <p eId="para_1485">On 11 December, the High Court made an order for the winding up of the company, following a petition from Bank of Ireland and Bank of Scotland who are owed some €8.4 million between them. I understand that FÁS is already in discussions with the company with a view to offering its full range of services to staff. These services include information and advice on alternative employment options, services which address the personal needs of workers facing redundancy and services which will provide  workers with education and flexible training options, and any other support that may be required. For industrial development purposes, Roscrea comes under the control of Shannon Development. The agency is committed to playing a full part in promoting the town and has a number of initiatives in hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1486">Shannon Development is committed to the development of a business park in Roscrea as a major objective and has committed significant resources in purchasing a prime 29 acre site adjacent to the N7, and is developing business and physical master plans for the site. It is envisaged that planning permission will be sought in early 2003 with phase one development works commencing in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1487">Shannon Development has approved a business expansion certificate to a local consortium to facilitate the construction of a modern advance industrial unit in the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_1488">This project is well advanced. The investment target has been achieved, the site has been acquired and construction has commenced. It is expected to be completed by March 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1489">The promoters of Rackett Hall Hotel are currently implementing a major expansion of 42 new bedrooms, a 600 capacity conference and banqueting centre, meeting rooms, etc. This will make a major contribution to the attractions of the town as an investment location. The Tipperary Technology Park in Thurles, located 21 miles from Roscrea, will add to the attractiveness of the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490">I will convey to the Tánaiste Deputy Hoctor's view that north Tipperary, Roscrea and Nenagh needs special attention. I assure the Deputy that the development agencies under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will continue to promote the Roscrea area and north Tipperary for investment and to find alternative employment for those who have lost their jobs.</p>

I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, is well aware of the storm which raged around the western coastline on Sunday, 1 December. It was particularly bad off the Clare coast which took the brunt of the raging wind and sea.</p>

One full-time fisherman whom I spoke to when I visited the scene last week told me he invested €120,000 in a boat last year. He is a small fisherman who lives in a local authority house in Quilty. His sole livelihood was fishing for lobsters. Fishing may not be a big industry in County Clare, but there  are areas where it is important. It is a difficult business. The owner of the boat told me that the recent huge increases in insurance costs meant he was unable to afford insurance for the boat. When the boat sank on 1 December, the estimated cost of repairing it was approximately €65,000. The man does not have an income and he is pondering his future. The other five fishermen are in a similar situation. They all have huge borrowings, but they do not have any prospect of paying them off unless a compensation package is put in place by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493">It has been claimed that a wall built last year by the Office of Public Works may have played a role in the devastation. While the eight feet high wall was a welcome development in terms of dealing with coastal erosion, it acted as a barrier in this case as the sea became trapped behind it. That may have caused the boats to sink. The fishermen claim the tide was low that evening. It was another five days before there was a high tide. This incident was totally unexpected because Quilty did not experience any such loss before. Many local fishermen and boat owners from neighbouring villages used to tie their boats to the pier at Quilty because it was a safe place to shelter them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494">I understand a surveyor from the Office of Public Works visited the scene last week to see the new wall and the damaged boats. I welcome that quick response. If the new wall contributed to the sinking of the boats, there is an onus on the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Office of Public Works to pay some compensation to these hard working fishermen whose livelihoods have been ruined by the sudden storm. I hope the surveyor's report will be published shortly. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to contact the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to ensure the report is published as soon as possible. I urge him to compensate the fishermen without delay. The amount of damage is estimated at approximately €135,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495">Without immediate assistance, fishing in Quilty could be ruined. Many local fishermen invested in boats because they had confidence in the industry. The recent population census shows a dramatic fall in the number of young people leaving the area for urban centres. The Minister should protect our rural livelihoods of which the fishing industry in west Clare is an integral part.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_843">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1496">I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the matter raised by Deputy Pat Breen on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. I regret I do not have any good news for the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497">The recent heavy storms had an impact on the livelihoods of fishermen. I am sure the House will appreciate and understand that weather con ditions are an integral element in the lives and routines of fishermen. Fishing is a highly weather dependant activity and inevitably fishing patterns are disturbed from time to time each year by periods of bad weather, such as that which occurred in recent weeks. However, that is not to downplay its significance in terms of its impact on the people concerned, but rather to highlight its inevitability for all fishermen as this is not a phenomenon unique to Ireland; it is an accepted reality of fishing all over the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1498">It will not come as a surprise to the House that this issue has been raised on a number of occasions over the years. I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Pat Breen about fishermen whose fishing activities have been hampered in recent weeks. I note what he said about the one individual who suffered huge losses. Regrettably however, there is no specific funding mechanism available to the Department to alleviate financial hardship in the manner proposed by Deputy Pat Breen. Under EU state aid rules, approval for financial assistance to the fishing industry in whatever form must be obtained from the European Commission. Any question, therefore, of introducing a compensatory measure of the type indicated by the Deputy would have to be considered within that framework. In the context of previous correspondence and discussions between previous Ministers and the European Commission on this issue going back the best part of a decade, the Commission has made clear its fundamental opposition to aid packages for any income loss due to periods of bad weather. The Commission has also affirmed that its opposition to such schemes extends not only to EU funds but also to national Exchequer funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1499">Against this background, it is clear there is no realistic prospect of the Minister being in a position to make provision to alleviate the financial hardship of fishermen suffering loss through damage to their boats and the consequent risk to their livelihoods. One would expect that private insurance arrangements would be made to cover such eventualities. I note what the Deputy said about the man who did not have proper, if any, insurance. However, it would be incorrect to draw inference that the Government is not mindful of the difficulties that can afflict fishermen. The Government remains concerned about those fishermen who operate out of smaller inshore boats and who depend on catches of whitefish for their income. These are the most vulnerable people in the fishing communities as they are most affected by weather conditions. With this situation in mind the previous Government introduced the fishing assist programme in the late 1990s.</p>
          <p eId="para_1500">I will convey the Deputy's comments regarding the wall to the Minister. I do not know if that will open any door for him, but I will report the matter and find out if it can be investigated. Failing that, it appears EU rules do not allow the Department to take a sympathetic approach. I do not know if anything can be developed on that.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_844">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1501">Tralee's senior citizens commenced a campaign four years ago to get a community and nursing unit for their town. The campaign was championed by Ellen Rowan, Christy Tobin and Máireád Fernane, it received widespread support and a community and nursing unit to be located on the grounds of Tralee General Hospital was eventually approved by the Southern Health Board. The group met the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who committed to the necessary finance for the project and promised his full, enthusiastic support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502">The committee championing the cause of the elderly in Tralee saw many family members and neighbours being transferred to St. Columbanus's long-stay hospital in Killarney. It is a fine hospital which provides its patients with excellent care, but it is difficult and inconvenient for elderly people from Tralee to visit relatives in Killarney. If they do not have their own vehicle, they must rely on public transport, which means it will take an entire day to travel to and from the town. Tralee and its hinterland is home to a population of about 30,000 people and is the only town in the country of that size which does not have a community hospital. Senior citizens felt strongly that it was about time this changed and began their campaign. The campaign's leaders were recognised by the President, Mary McAleese, who received Ellen Rowan and members of her committee in Áras an Uachtaráin. They were given a civic reception by Tralee UDC in recognition of their efforts and of their commitment to their community and the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503">The committee has now grown frustrated and impatient. Some of the original members are dead and 20 elderly patients from Tralee are residing in St. Columbanus's home. They would much prefer to be in hospital in Tralee which is why the committee wants immediate action. It seeks a positive response to the questions I am asking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504">The accommodation brief was submitted to the Department of Health and Children for approval in November 2001. Additional information requested by the Department in relation to that brief and the estimated costs arising from the project were supplied on 22 January 2002. The advertisement for a design team was posted in the <i>EU Journal</i> in March and that team has been selected. However, the team cannot be appointed by the committee until the approval of the Department is given. Members of the campaign committee met the Minister for Finance in February and were assured that the additional funding for the unit would be made available. I realise the Minister of State is not the Minister for Health and Children, but I hope he can give me, on behalf of the elderly people of Tralee and the committee, a firm commitment and an unambiguous statement to  the effect that the design team can be appointed. I look forward to his reply.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_845">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1505">I welcome the opportunity to address the House on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, with regard to this matter. It is the policy of the Department of Health and Children, in the context of capital investments for older persons generally, to provide new nursing units or similar facilities to enable patients to access care as close to their local communities as is reasonably possible. Such locally-based units are important for those receiving care as they provide access to appropriate levels and types of care, provide respite and day care to help maintain older people at home for as long as possible and permit more frequent visits by relatives and friends. They also help to alleviate pressure on acute hospital services and allow for earlier discharge of older patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506">The proposed development in Tralee will be tailored to meet the particular needs of its potential clients and will comprise a 50-bed nursing unit, various treatment and remedial departments and back-up administrative and services facilities. The project will incorporate 40 extended care beds, five convalescent beds, three respite beds and two palliative care support beds. The overall number of beds provided in this new development will not exceed the service norms as set out in the policy document for services for older people The Years Ahead – A Policy for the Elderly. While day care is not an integral part of this project, the future provision of such services, including facilities for Alzheimer's patients, is being examined in the context of joint initiatives between the Southern Health Board, Tralee Town Council and local voluntary groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1507">Based on the brief prepared by the project team, the most recent cost of the proposed project is of the order of €8.5 million. A basic principle of the design team's brief will be the need for economy in terms of running costs. Certain revenue costs must also be taken into account to ensure that the development will be a properly staffed, modern service facility. The capital cost of the project will be met from funding provided in the national development plan. The Department of Health and Children is reviewing, from a national point of view, the NDP for the health sector in light of the outturn position for 2002. The review also provides for existing capital contractual commitments and the commencement, where possible, of the planning or construction of new projects nationally in 2003 and beyond within the overall funding resources available. It is in this context that capital developments for the Southern Health Board region, including the proposed new unit at Tralee, are being examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1508">The Department of Health and Children fully appreciates the urgency and importance of progressing this particular development. It will continue to work closely with the Southern Health Board with regard to the board's capital needs  and priorities for next year with a view to appointing a design team for this project at the earliest possible date. I will convey the Deputy's concerns to the Minister. Unfortunately a definite decision is not yet available. Hopefully, the full programme will be given clearance early in the new year.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Land Rezoning.</heading>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_846">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_1509">Pending a full investigation into the controversial rezoning of lands in 1998 and the role played in that process by developers, lobbyists, councillors and council officials in south Dublin, the designation of Adamstown as a strategic development zone should be suspended. There should also be an examination of matters pertaining to that designation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510">The lands at Adamstown, Lucan, County Dublin, were designated as a strategic development zone by the Government in 2001. As a result, a statutory process begins on 6 January to develop the lands in a detailed manner. Following public consultation, the final plan from the council may be accepted, modified or rejected by councillors. If it is rejected, developers may table their own plans. If it is accepted, it will go to An Bord Pleanála for a final decision following further submissions. The merits of the current plans are not in question, nor are the rights and wrongs of housing at this location. However, there is significant suspicion hanging over the original rezoning of Adamstown which, allied to new information published in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> last week, makes it imperative that any SDZ designation be frozen until the facts can come out fully. I have written to the Flood tribunal calling on it to investigate the circumstances surrounding Adamstown's rezoning, as has at least one other local representative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511">The facts surrounding this case are interesting to say the least. Adamstown has a history of failed attempts to rezone the land, yet the largest segment was purchased in 1996 and 1997 by Castlethorn Developments for €30 million. That whopping investment in Adamstown was made before the land was rezoned. The big question is what crystal ball did Joe Reilly and his team use to show them that the lands would be rezoned after their purchase. The Adamstown lands are now valued at over ten times their agricultural price which means a significant killing will have been made if housing can go up, no matter what checks and balances can be made by the community. I want to know if Castlethorn Developments got lucky or if it got a tip-off. Did it tip the balance in its favour by bribing officials? I make no allegations and hold no firm opinion, but it is my duty, as an elected representative, to help find out how the lands came to be rezoned and by whom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512">According to the article in <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> it now transpires that Joe Reilly paid Richard Lynn €25,000 as a consultant on Adams town. Straight away alarm bells ring. We already know of Lynn's dubious record in relation to the Cherrywood Development. Cherrywood is one of the most controversial of all, with money alleged to have been paid on behalf of Monarch Properties to councillors, the very suspicions that prompted Messrs. Smith and McEochaidh to issue a reward for information which ultimately led to the Flood tribunal.</p>

It does not take a rocket scientist to smell a whiff of something foul when the aforementioned person played the same role in the rezoning of Adamstown. Did he pocket the €25,000 for himself or was it passed on to council officials and councillors? The jury is out, but the question is valid and needs to be answered clearly and without uncertainty.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_1519">I will not mention any more names. A few days before the draft plan was published in 1997, a rezoned Adamstown was added on by the assistant county manager. What inspired officials to rezone Adamstown at the last minute to the shock and surprise of Lucan residents when Lucan already had enough land rezoned to last at least five years? Why did not South Dublin County Council give a detailed account of contacts between officials and Castlethorn? We need to know the truth. We need to be reassured that it was all just a cosy chat in the interests of sustainable development. But I fear we will be disappointed. If the SDZ goes ahead before an investigation, irreparable damage will be done to Lucan. The infrastructural guarantees may not be there to ensure that Adamstown's 10,000 houses will be built in a phased and sustainable way. Iarnród Éireann, Dublin Bus, the Department of Education and Science, the Dublin Transportation Office and South Dublin County Council have no coherence, no guarantees. We can work with the current enlightened planners and community groups and take a gamble with An Bord Pleanála but the pain and stress will be worth nothing if we find out in a year that the land should never have been rezoned in the way and at the time it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520">We also need to know how Adamstown was designated as an SDZ in 2001. What transpired between Castlethorn and the then Minister responsible for this SDZ? What contributions  were made to the Progressive Democrats by the developer and was the Whip applied in terms of voting for the development?</p>
          <p eId="para_1521">Planning in Lucan has been a mess. The Liffey Valley rezoning was dodgy, Laraghcon was questionable as is Adamstown. There appears to be something rotten with the state of development zones such as Adamstown. A former county manager became a consultant for a developer who is responsible for a large number of planning breaches in the county.</p>

          <p eId="para_1525">My suspicion is that something untoward happened to change the zoning of lands. I am not naming names but was money paid over to corrupt officials and councillors by people acting on their own or in collusion with others? We need to know the truth before the land is developed. Laraghcon was destroyed before the Flood tribunal had a chance to ascertain suspicions of corruption. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to ensure the same does not happen to Adamstown? He should freeze the SDZ for three years and examine it thoroughly. Lucan and good planning in general depends on the Minister to ensure that transparency exists where we now have shade and confusion. There are questions that need to be answered and I hope they will be answered during the suspension.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_857">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1526">The Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments was established by the Oireachtas to inquire into and report on various planning matters. Any allegation of wrongdoing in relation to the zoning of land referred to by the Deputy would be a matter to be investigated by the tribunal. My Department is not aware if this particular zoning decision is under investigation by the tribunal. Perhaps if the tribunal found whatever newspaper article the Deputy speaks of to be of interest, it might commence investigations if it has not already done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1527">I wish to outline the history of the designation of the Adamstown lands as a strategic development zone. The lands in question were zoned residential by the South Dublin County Development plan which was adopted by the council on 15 December 1998. I understand this was on the recommendation of the professional planners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528">The fundamental goal of the Government's housing policy since we took office has been to put in place a range of measures that would  create the conditions to increase the supply of housing to meet demand. One of the many initiatives taken by this Government to increase supply was the designation of large residential sites as strategic development zones in order to fast-track these sites through the planning system so that all land use planning issues were considered properly while at the same time getting units on the ground as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529">Part 9 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides that the Government can designate sites as SDZs where, in their opinion, specified development on particular sites is of economic or social importance to the State. Three sites were designated by Government order for residential development on 19 June 2001. The orders came into force on 1 July 2001. The three sites are located in Adamstown in Lucan, Hansfield in Blanchardstown and Clonmagadden Valley, Navan. Each of these sites has estimated housing yields of 8,000, 1,750 and 1,400 units respectively. The local area plan for the Adamstown area was published in 2001 and was subsequently adopted by South Dublin County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1530">The SDZ sites were designated following an evaluation by the Department of the Environment and Local Government of proposals submitted by the relevant local authorities. All the proposals received by the Department were assessed having regard to the provisions of Part 9 of the Planning and Development Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1531">The Adamstown SDZ site is strategically located, adjacent to a rail line, is in close proximity to the outer ring road and is served by two quality bus corridors. Not only will the site deliver up to 8,000 housing units but the planning scheme also provides for schools, community and childcare facilities, shopping and parks, all important components to ensure a high quality living environment. It is also important to note that the phasing of the development has been carefully thought out so as not to impact adversely on the existing community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1532">The local authorities concerned were asked to expedite the preparation of planning schemes and the provision of infrastructure for the SDZ sites. I understand that South Dublin County Council expect to put the planning scheme for Adamstown on public display, as Deputy Gogarty said, on 6 January 2003 for a period of six weeks. Adamstown is still viewed as a very important residential site, with a potential housing yield of up to 8,000 dwelling units close to the city in the metropolitan area, thereby avoiding further urban sprawl and long-distance commuting. For all these reasons, the Minister does not intend to propose to the Government that it should revoke its order for the designation of Adamstown as a strategic development zone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1533">The Deputy said he had reported the matter to the tribunal. It is up to the tribunal to consider  whether there is anything in what the Deputy has said.</p>

          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_1538">In July last year, the Government approved the drafting of an Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill, along the lines of a general scheme presented to Government. In January, 2002 the draft text of the Bill was submitted to Government and was approved for publication and circulated to Deputies. Unfortunately, due to pressing time constraints, the Bill did not proceed further at that time. Section 114 of the Defence Act, 1954, which prescribes a redress of wrongs procedure, will be amended by this Bill. It is my intention that the Bill will be enacted early in 2003 and an appointment made to the new office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces as soon as practical thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1539">Traditionally, the Defence sector was highly regulated with most military matters governed by Defence Forces regulations made by the Minister for Defence under the Defence Acts. While these regulations had little or no relevance outside the Defence Forces sector, it was recognised in the Department that simplification and reform was necessary to keep pace with the ongoing modernisation of the sector. Much of that simplification has been carried out and the process will continue in the coming years, with the objective of modernising regulations and streamlining administrative procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">In 1999, the Government established the statute law reform unit in the office of the Attorney General which was tasked with the mission of statute law reform and consolidation in the context of the regulatory reform dimension of the strategic management initiative. In conjunction with this unit, officials within my Department have prepared a draft restatement of the Defence Acts, 1954 to 1998, and the Courts Martial Appeals Act, 1983, and it is intended, following the proposed enactment of the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill, 2000, to restate the Defence Acts for easy reference and access. The Department of Defence will be one of the first Departments to go forward with this major element of statute law reform.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_63">In July 2001, the deputy chief of staff (support) convened a military law review board to review the existing disciplinary provisions contained within Part V of the Defence Act, 1954. A detailed report was prepared and submitted to me by the chief of staff recommending a number of technical amendments to the Act. This report  and its recommendations are now under consideration by the office of the Attorney General.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Sargent</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Defence</b>
      the reason Ireland's contribution of troops to Eritrea, as part of the UN mission, UNMEE, is ending in 2003; his views on whether Ireland's contribution to UN missions, in general, and to UN missions outside of Europe, specifically, will then be greatly diminished; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1543">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 57 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1544">Ireland's commitment to collective security is pursued through the UN, which has the primary role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security. Ireland has a long record of participation in UN-international peacekeeping, monitoring and observer missions and the policy is to continue with involvement in such international missions in the cause of world peace. In this regard, Deputies will be aware that participation in any overseas mission is subject to the existence of a UN Mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1545">In October, 1998, Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations on the UN standby arrangements system, UNSAS. Ireland offered, through UNSAS, to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time to meet UN and other peace support, and humanitarian commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1546">The Defence Forces are currently training and developing their capabilities in order to be in a position to rapidly respond to any demand from the UN which may arise in the context of our commitment to UNSAS. To achieve the required levels of skills and competencies, it is important that Ireland contributes forces to missions which provide opportunities, in theatre, for exercising the requisite range of skills for different types of operations and that it has an agreed entry and exit strategy for each mission.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_64">With regard to the deployment of a Defence Forces contingent to the United Nations mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE, the UN formally invited Ireland to contribute a guard and administration company to serve with UNMEE at the Force headquarters in Asmara, Eritrea, with effect from 11 December, 2001, for a minimum period of 12 months. On 18 July, 2001, the Government authorised, subject to the approval of the Dáil, the despatch of a contingent of the  Permanent Defence Force for service with UNMEE. On 26 October 2001, Dáil Éireann approved the despatch of the contingent comprising 209 Defence Forces personnel. It was always intended that Ireland would only undertake a small number of rotations in UNMEE and, hence, we have signalled our planned withdrawal from UNMEE for June 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">The total number of Defence Forces personnel serving overseas is 486, of whom 445 are currently serving on UN missions. Full details are as listed in the following tabular statement. The withdrawal from UNMEE will result in an overall reduction in the numbers deployed on overseas missions, if we do not increase our commitment on other missions or if we do not deploy to new  missions. However, such fluctuations are not unusual, but rather are a natural consequence of commitments coming to an end. New missions will arise from time to time. In addition, other troop contributing countries may reconfigure their contingents, resulting in requests for Ireland to increase its contribution to a particular mission. In this regard, as Deputies will be aware, I have recently signalled that we will be changing the composition of our forces in the UN mandated missions in KFOR and SFOR from a transport company and MP company respectively to a light infantry company in KFOR of up to 250 personnel, which is a more appropriate configuration at this time, given our UNSAS commitment and represents an overall increase in our commitment to this mission of 75 personnel.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_1817">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 24 and 61 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1818">The Government in 1998 approved a programme of evacuation and sale of certain barracks which were considered surplus to requirements. The proceeds from the sales, plus payroll savings based on revised personnel numbers for the Defence Forces, are being used to fund an investment programme for equipment and facilities. Pending the completion of the sale contract for Clancy Barracks it would be inappropriate to indicate pricing details at this stage. However, any proceeds arising from the sale of the barracks will also be invested in the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1819">The White Paper set out my major new plans for an investment programme of €320 million on equipment and facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1820">With regard to the purchase of equipment the initial contract for the supply of 40 armoured personnel carriers by Mowag of Switzerland to the Defence Forces is now complete. The original contract contains an option for the supply of up to 40 additional APCs by Mowag. This option has now been exercised albeit for a reduced number of APCs because of the changed financial situation. I signed a contract earlier this week for the provision by Mowag of 25 additional APCs. The contract value is in the region of €33.2 million including VAT. Deliveries will commence in March 2004 and are scheduled to be completed by September 2004. Payments under the contract will extend from December 2002 to September 2005 due to the budgetary situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1821">The tender competition for the acquisition of eight trainer aircraft for the air corps is progressing, with the tenders currently under evaluation. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the award of the contract before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1822">With regard to the provision of facilities, approximately €41 million will be expended this year on an ongoing capital building programme to provide modern living, operational and training facilities for the Defence Forces. Major projects include upgrading of accommodation in McKee Barracks, Cathal Brugha Barracks, Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, Kilworth Camp and Coolmoney Camp, and improvements in waste, water and ablution facilities in the Curragh, Kilworth Camp and Coolmoney Camp.</p>
          <p eId="para_1823">This significant investment, together with ongoing developments, will ensure the continuing progress of equipment and facilities for our Defence Force.</p>

          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_1826">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 14 and together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1827">The EC 135 has been accepted on to the military register and is currently undergoing a work-up, training and familiarisation period in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. This will take approximately one month, whereupon the aircraft will then go operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_1828">The EC 135 is a welcome addition to the Garda air support unit (GASU) which also comprises one twin-engined AS355N Squirrel helicopter and one Defender 4000 fixed-wing aircraft. The Garda Síochána are responsible for the operational control and policing functions of the service, while the air corps personnel have responsibility for all matters relating to the flying and maintenance of the aircraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_1829">With the introduction of the EC135, the air corps assumes responsibility for flying this aircraft, while the maintenance is contracted out. The original plan had been to contract out both flying and maintenance. However, for technical, operational and legal reasons this did not prove possible. However, the air corps will continue to be responsible for all matters relating to the flying and maintenance of the existing aircraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_1830">While the introduction of the new aircraft has taken some time, due to lead times for the manufacture of the aircraft and the extensive fitting out of the aircraft with highly sophisticated equipment, I would stress that both the Department of Defence and the air corps have co-operated fully in this process.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_77">The question of night flying capacity has been the subject of ongoing communication between the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It should be noted that there are no restrictions on the Garda helicopter for night operations in the greater Dublin area, where the greatest number of night call-outs has occurred. Cover is also provided on request in urban areas outside of Dublin. The demand for night-time air support in non-urban rural areas is relatively small. That said, it is obviously desirable that the facility for air support in such areas would be available should it be required, while having regard to the absolute priority of the safe operation of the aircraft. I am pleased to report that a training programme for  night operations is being developed in conjunction with the introduction into service of the new EC 135.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1833">I propose to take Question Nos. 11 and 25 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1834">On 15 October 2002, 1 presented a confidential annual report to Government on emergency planning dealing with issues that had arisen during the previous year. The events of 11 September 2001 fundamentally affected the emergency planning agenda in Ireland and in many other countries. Such reports must be classified as confidential because they deal with matters which have arisen from the work carried out in the aftermath.</p>
          <p eId="para_1835">The content and the context in which information is presented and debated can be misused by unscrupulous people and can, in itself, become a weapon in the wrong hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_1836">The report noted the developments in emergency planning that have taken place since October 2001 across all relevant Departments and agencies. It noted a high level of confidence in the emergency services such as the Garda Síochana, fire and health services and the Defence Forces. A press release covering the ground, in general terms, has been issued by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1837">Following the tragic events in the US in September 2001, the Government put the necessary steps in place at ministerial and official level to examine the robustness of emergency planning in Ireland. It became apparent at an early stage that there was a necessity to put structures in place to support existing services and to improve coordination across the various existing national emergency plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1838">A Government task force on emergency planning was set up to harness the work of those Departments and agencies with key roles in the process. In my capacity as chair of the task force, I ensured that the new emergency planning challenges were addressed with a view to developing policies to respond to possible threats and to increase coordination.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_79">A new office, the office of emergency planning, was set up within my Department to take the lead role in emergency planning to meet potential terrorist threats, to promote coordination across all Departments and agencies involved and to  oversee the emergency planning process. The office of emergency planning provides an effective focus on the changing nature of emergency planning and associated issues and has built strong partnerships to improve the effectiveness of emergency planning and response.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">Government decided that this new office would not take over the lead emergency planning responsibility of Departments and agencies. It was recognised that they were doing good work but that the office of emergency planning would work with them to look afresh and to re-evaluate their emergency planning arrangements in the light of the new threat.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">An interdepartmental working group on emergency planning was set up encompassing all the Departments with lead roles in the various national plans. The members of this group have worked together to build long-term partnerships which continue to develop the strengths and capabilities of emergency planners. They implemented the initiatives of the task force throughout the various emergency systems and addressed the practical matters which could reduce the potential impacts of emergencies in this State. The result has been a new focus on emergency planning. As chair of the task force, I am satisfied with the level of cooperation and mutual assistance across all Departments and agencies. The work of the Government task force on emergency planning, the interdepartmental working group and the office of emergency planning will continue to improve emergency planning mechanisms and response arrangements. The long-term goal for Government is to provide effective coordinated planning and response across the whole threat spectrum.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1840">A military board, the reserve defence force review implementation board, was established to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the reserve steering group. I established this special Reserve Steering Group in 1998 to undertake a study of the reserve. The group reported to me in September 1999. Under the aegis of the military implementation board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. I received a copy of the draft reserve Defence Force review implementation board report from the chief of staff in June and the report is currently under consideration.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_82">The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army Reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">I emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1846">A draft integrated personnel management system, or IPMS, has been prepared by the military authorities and is now being considered by the Department's civil-military strategic management committee. The IPMS will encompass a new career development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1847">The requirements which the IPMS must meet are set out in chapter 4.5 of the White Paper on Defence. The focus is on ensuring the availability of military personnel with the appropriate skills to undertake whatever tasks the State requires. In this regard, the IPMS will try to ensure that personnel policies and practices keep pace with current best practice to the benefit of the organisation and of the people in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1848">In simple terms, the IPMS will deal with the broad range of personnel and human resource management and development issues. These include manpower policy and planning, equality of opportunity and treatment and the right to dignity at work, recruitment, terms of enlistment, induction, training education and development, physical and medical fitness, career guidance management and development, promotion, the regulatory framework, retirement, and pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1849">Within that broad context, it is intended that there would be a career development plan for all Defence Forces personnel. It is important to note that the issues which the IPMS must address are very complex and that the details, including the details of the career development plan, have yet to be finalised and agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1850">I do not want to pre-empt the discussions taking place in the strategic management committee. However, I can say in a general way that a career development plan would seek to ensure that people joining the Defence Forces are aware of the career opportunities available to them and are also aware of the standards to be reached and maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1851">The plan would be designed to give to all personnel the right blend of skills training, education, work assignments and experience to equip them to carry out their tasks, to enhance the quality of their work life and to enable them to compete for promotion opportunities. Also, there would be an updated performance management system and performance appraisal and feedback which would have an appropriate element of career guidance and management built into it. All personnel, whether officers or enlisted personnel, would be covered by the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1852">The IPMS is being discussed by the strategic management committee. Once these discussions are completed, I expect that a final draft of the IPMS will be submitted to me.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_86">Before any final decisions are taken, it is my intention that the Defence Forces representative  associations will be fully consulted in a spirit of partnership in accordance with the system of representation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">I hope to see the IPMS finalised in 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1855">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 33 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1856">A total of 31 non-commissioned officers have been commissioned as officers in the Army, air corps and Naval Service in the past five years. The numbers commissioned in each year are detailed in the tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1857">Potential officers courses (POC) are held for non-commissioned personnel from time to time within the Defence Forces. Personnel who successfully complete such courses are commissioned as officers in the Permanent Defence Force. Participants on such courses are selected on a competitive basis. In addition, from time to time non-commissioned personnel who hold suitable qualifications are commissioned to fill specialist appointments where vacancies arise. Eligible non-commissioned personnel may also apply for the annual cadetship competitions. The requirement for potential officer courses and commissioning from the ranks (CFR) competitions is reviewed from time to time. This is one of the specific issues which is to be addressed in the context of the integrated personnel management system (IPMS) for the Defence Forces. The IPMS is one of the major policy initiatives provided for in the White Paper on Defence. Provision for the introduction of regular schemes to commission enlisted personnel as officers in the Army, air corps and Naval Service will be one of the core issues to be dealt with by the military authorities in drafting the IPMS. A preliminary draft plan of the IPMS has been considered by the Department's strategic management committee and is now being further refined by the military authorities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_88">Draft conditions governing the appointment of enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force to be officers of the Naval Service are under discussion with the representative associations. As the discussions with the representative associations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment on any of  the specifics of the proposed draft conditions. However, it is the intention that a potential  officers course will be run as soon as these discussions are completed.</summary>

      the reason for the reduction of 16% in the allocation for equitation in his Department's Estimates for 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1879">The mission of the equitation school is to advertise the Irish non-thoroughbred horse. The equitation school has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years. Through its participation in equestrian events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse both thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred. The school has consistently provided horses and riders of the highest quality for Irish international show jumping teams and, allowing for the contribution of individual civilian riders, the Army riders have in many respects formed the backbone of international teams over many years and have made a major contribution to Ireland qualifying for the Nations Cup Super League in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1880">I have made considerable investment in the school in recent years. Specifically, an additional provision of €330,000, 46% in the 2001 Defence Estimate, was maintained in 2002. As a result the equitation school is currently in a very healthy position with 54 horses, including 32 showjumping and eventing horses and has 37 personnel, including seven riding officers and one cadet officer in training. This investment has reaped significant dividends especially in 2002, where the school achieved 25 International victories which is the largest number in almost 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1881">The required reduction in expenditure on the Defence Vote amounts to an approximate 1% reduction on the expected outturn for this year. This will be achieved by managing the overall allocation in such a way as to ensure that the priority areas of expenditure are protected in the context of the overall Defence requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1882">In relation to the provision shown in the 2003 Abridged Estimate for the equitation school, the amount allocated reflects the normal level of expenditure for the school. The amount expended in the past two years involved additional investment in the school.</p>

          <p eId="para_1887">I attended the General Affairs and External Relations Council re-inforced by EU Defence Ministers in Brussels on 19 November, 2002. In accordance with the mandate of the European Council at Seville, the Presidency had taken forward work to promote the development of military and civilian capabilities for crisis management within the framework of ESDP. The Council underlined the importance of ensuring co-ordination of the EU's civilian and military crisis management instruments in order to be able to respond effectively to a crisis. In this respect the Council welcomed the action plan for the further strengthening of civil-military co-ordination in EU crisis management to be completed before the end of the Greek Presidency.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_92">The Council welcomed the political and security committee progress report on military capabilities, including the European capability action plan, ECAP, which invites the member states to take appropriate decisions on how to implement the future achievement of capabilities from the  range of options proposed. It noted that the overall assessment, drawn from the intermediate reports from the ECAP panels, was encouraging, taking into account that 19 panels are currently considering most of the significant shortfalls in capabilities to be remedied.</summary>

This will serve to evaluate the military implications of each proposed option, to examine whether further interim options are required to fill potential gaps, to study whether any further solutions are possible, and finally to identify whether any remaining shortfalls impose constraints or limitations on the delivery of the headline goal.</summary>

It confirmed the need for the enhancement of the Union's capability to react to a crisis requiring rapid response particularly for humanitarian and rescue tasks, which will require accelerated decision making and deployment. The Council welcomed progress to date and agreed to task the PSC and the EU military committee (EUMC) to finalise the work on rapid response elements as soon as possible. In this context, the Council requested the Greek Presidency to prepare a progress report with special emphasis on EU military rapid response in the overall context of EU crisis management.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1906">I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 78, 80, 81, 82, and 83 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1907">It should be made clear that the present case differs from the case recently reviewed by the Judge Advocate General at my request. The substantive issues in regard to the case raised today by the Deputy were determined by both the High Court in 1979 and the Supreme Court in 1982 after full hearings. In the case recently examined by the Judge Advocate General, the individual applied for a judicial review in 1998, in relation to a matter in 1969 and was unsuccessful in that application by virtue of the Statute of Limitations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1908">The former member of the Permanent Defence Force referred to today by the Deputy was discharged from the Permanent Defence Force on 13 June, 1975 on the grounds of his services being no longer required. He was discharged because the military authorities considered that he was a security risk and that his discharge was desirable in the interests of the service. The individual was questioned in relation to the theft of a machine gun from Clancy Barracks in January, 1973.</p>
          <p eId="para_1909">On 20 February 1976 solicitors acting for the person in question advised the Department that they had been instructed to commence proceedings for their client's re-instatement in the Army and for damages for defamation, breach of constitutional rights and wrongful dismissal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1910">A conditional High Court order was obtained by the person in question on 26 July, 1976 directing the Minister for Defence and the Attorney General to send before the court, for the purpose of being quashed, the order recording the decision to discharge the person in question, on the ground that the decision to discharge him constituted a denial of natural and constitutional justice and was an infringement of his constitutional rights.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_99">An application to make the conditional High Court order absolute was heard in the High Court on 9 and 10 March, 1977 by the President of the High Court who reserved judgment. Judgment was delivered in the High Court on 8 October, 1979. The court found in favour of the Minister for Defence. The judge held that he saw no grounds on which the order discharging the applicant from the Army should be quashed. The mat ter was appealed to the Supreme Court and on 1 February, 1982 the Supreme Court upheld the original High Court decision and awarded costs to the Minister for Defence.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">While the person in question was not charged with any offences under either military or civil law, the full text of the High Court judgment makes it quite clear that there is no requirement that an individual be so charged before he can be discharged from the Defence Forces on the statutory grounds which applied in this case.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_101">In relation to the discharge book, the position is that during the original High Court proceedings, it was conceded that an error had been made by the military authorities in the conduct assessment of unsatisfactory shown on the discharge book issued to the person concerned when he was discharged. It was accepted that the correct conduct assessment, in accordance with the relevant regulations, should in fact have been fair. The High Court judgment also made it quite clear, however, that this error did not invalidate the substantive decision to discharge the person in question.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_102">In 1982, following the Supreme Court decision, inquiries were made by the Department and it was established that the discharge book had not been returned to the military authorities for amendment. The position was conveyed to the Department's legal advisers who undertook to inform the plaintiff's then solicitor of the position. The whereabouts of the discharge book was not raised again by this individual until 1995 when, in response to personal and legal correspondence received, a further check by the military authorities confirmed that there still was no record of the discharge book having been returned to them for amendment. The person concerned was furnished with a statement of service and was requested to return the discharge book for amendment. To date, the discharge book has not been submitted to the military authorities for amendment of the conduct assessment and nor is there any record of it having been in the possession of the Department or the military authorities since it was originally issued to the individual in question. It would appear from the Departmental file that a photo copy of the discharge book was an exhibit to one of the affidavits lodged by the plaintiff when he initiated proceedings and the book itself was therefore presumably either in his own custody or care or that of his legal advisers during the conduct of the proceedings. In that regard it should be noted that a discharge book is an original and unique document and a copy is not retained by the military authorities.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1916">The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) met at Head of State and Government (summit) level in Prague on 21-22 November 2002. While this is only the third such meeting at summit level, EAPC Foreign and Defence Ministers meet separately at six monthly intervals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1917">Established in 1997, the EAPC is the multilateral political framework for participants in Partnership for Peace (PfP). It has become an important forum for discussions which bring together all participants in PfP on a wide range of matters including developments on peacekeeping, humanitarian issues, regional cooperation, arms control, civil defence and disaster relief. Consultations in the EAPC framework have also included matters such as the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and the political dimension of crisis management, for example regarding UN authorised operations such as SFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina and KFOR in Kosovo, in which Ireland participates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1918">Grounded on the basic principles of the UN Charter and the OSCE basic documents, the EAPC has become part of the international security architecture, complementing and reinforcing the work of the other international security organisations such as the UN and the OSCE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1919">The EAPC, moreover, reflects the basic PfP approach whereby partners are able to decide for themselves the level and areas of cooperation with NATO. The 19 members of NATO and 27 PfP countries who participate in the EAPC were represented in Prague.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_107">Partners were asked to endorse a partnership action plan against terrorism containing proposals for further cooperation among partners in the post-11 September context. The plan is set in the context of UN Security Council Resolution 1373 which aimed to strengthen the global response to terrorism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">The plan provides a loose framework to expand some existing EAPC activities that contribute to combating terrorism. This includes, for instance, intensified consultation and information sharing, enhanced preparedness for operations against terrorism, means of impeding support for terrorist groups, ways of contributing towards the management of the consequences of terrorism, as well as assistance for individual EAPC countries efforts against terrorism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_109">It is clearly stated that the core principle of self-differentiation applies to the plan in that the efforts against terrorism outlined are open to all EAPC participants that are willing and able to contribute. Moreover, the complementarity between efforts in this area in the EAPC framework and in other relevant international bodies is clearly stated.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_110">Participation in Partnership for Peace (PfP) activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation. Each PfP country prepares an individual partnership programme (IPP), in consultation with the NATO staff, tailored to its own interests and priorities. This programme is intended to give practical effect to the priority areas identified for cooperation in the PfP context. This is achieved by selecting specific activities from an overall work programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_111">In accordance with this fundamental principle, all decisions regarding the content and form of the Ireland's two IPPs to date have been made by the Irish authorities. The details of the IPP activities for 2002-03 have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_112">Ireland's third IPP, to cover the period 2003-04, is currently in the course of preparation, in consultation with the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Environment and Local Government, Justice Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_113">As provided for in the presentation document for PfP, Ireland also participates in the PfP Planning and review process (known as PARP). In common with the other EU neutrals, Ireland is using the PARP process in connection with planning for the Petersberg Tasks. The scope of our involvement in PARP is focused on improving capabilities Ireland has offered in the context of the EU headline goal.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_114">The training opportunities provided by Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace will further enhance the development of the Defence Forces consistent with the objectives of the Government White Paper on Defence published in February, 2000 which analysed in con siderable depth the Defence responses to the changing defence and security environments, both national and international.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_115">While the partnership action plan against terrorism as presented at Prague does have some merit, I do not envisage any direct involvement of the Defence Forces in that context as part of Ireland's participation in PfP.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1922">The total 2003 provision for the civilian branch of the Department, in the administrative budget category of office supplies and computer equipment, is 16% greater than the estimated outturn for 2002.

          <p eId="para_1923">In relation to the military information and communications technology Estimate, additional provision was made in the 2002 Estimate for purchase of communications equipment for the stand-by battalion for peace support operations.

          <p eId="para_1926">A special allocation of €23.4 million was made in 2002 for building projects within the special barracks reinvestment programme (Subhead V). This programme will be largely completed at the end of this year, and the balance (about €5 million) will be consolidated within the normal building programme for 2003 (subhead L).  The provision shown in the 2003 Abridged Estimates for the capital building programme (subhead L) is €23.629 million which includes €18.869 million for the normal building programme. This amount of €18.869 million represents an increase of 5% over the provision of the normal building programme in 2002. There is also an increase of €0.95 million for 2003 over the 2002 provision for the non-capital building maintenance programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_1936">I believe that amending the Defence Act to allow the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, to apply to members of the Defence Forces would be wholly inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1937">I know that PDFORRA has placed a certain stress on the concept of the soldier as a citizen in uniform with the implication that the soldier's conditions of employment should largely replicate conditions in the civilian world. However, in a professional military organisation, this approach is simply not practical and this is widely recognised internationally. The position is that when an individual decides to join the Defence Forces, he or she voluntarily accepts, <i>inter alia</i>, a range of obligations and responsibilities which do not normally arise in the course of civilian employment. The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1938">I am satisfied that the mechanisms available to the representative association through the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme, with its access to facilitation and arbitration and parallel discussion during national pay talks, provide a framework within which issues of concern can and should be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1952">A contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers (APCs), initial spares, special tools and training courses. The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, included 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of €50.8 million, including VAT. The final payment of that contract will be made early next year. All 40 APCs have been delivered to the Curragh Camp.</p>
          <p eId="para_1953">Training of Defence Force personnel on the APCs has been continuing apace and the first overseas deployment of the APCs has taken place with six APCs in service in Eritrea.

          <p eId="para_1954">The original contract contains an option for the supply of up to 40 additional APCs by Mowag. This option has now been exercised albeit for a reduced number of APCs because of the changed financial situation. I signed a contract earlier this week for the provision by Mowag of 25 additional APCs. The contract value is in the region of €33.2 million including VAT. Deliveries will commence in March 2004 and are scheduled to be completed by September 2004. Payments under the contract will extend from December 2002 to September 2005 due to the budgetary situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1955">The signing of the contract is another significant boost for the Defence Forces and a further indicator of my commitment to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are fully equipped with modern equipment which enhances their safety in carrying out their various roles.</p>

          <p eId="para_2098">I am aware that the cancellation of the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps was raised at the RACO conference. The decision to cancel the tender competition last July was taken due to budgetary constraints which meant that the level of defence expenditure had to be reduced this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2099">The decision was an extremely difficult one for me. I regarded the acquisition of the helicopters for the Air Corps as a priority. I was also very aware of the huge effort that had been put into the tender process by Air Corps personnel and of their evident disappointment when the decision not to proceed was announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_2100">When the decision was made, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopters services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue while taking account of the current financial position.</p>
          <p eId="para_2101">An interdepartmental working group has been established to seek alternate solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP Unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions. This work is at an early stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_121">I am committed to maintaining the involvement of the Air Corps in search and rescue for the long-term. In this regard, the Air Corps are in the process of acquiring an S61 helicopter to operate in the North West region to replace the existing Dauphin helicopter. The S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from CHC Ireland Ltd. (CHCI) pursuant to existing  SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide the flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by CHCI. The S61 will operate out of Sligo Airport.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_122">Pilot training on the S61, which is being provided by CHCI, is currently ongoing. Subject to operational demands on existing SAR services and the availability of training assets and personnel, it is planned that the helicopter will go operational in early 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_123">Despite the fact that expenditure programmes have now to be prioritised, I will not allow anything to take precedence over the long-term development of the Air Corps most important resource, its pilots. The main priority for the Air Corps is the purchase of fixed wing training aircraft.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_124">The tender competition for the acquisition of eight trainer aircraft is going well and I am very hopeful that I will be in a position to make a substantive announcement on the award of the contract before the end of the year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2109">For the EU to be in a position to be able to act effectively in crisis management it must be able to deploy the full range of civilian and military means at its disposal in a coherent and co-ordinated manner. Priority is being accorded to developing instruments and modalities for civil-military co-ordination in the ESDP context. Crisis management procedures are being developed that should guarantee quick, effective and coherent decision-making in Petersberg Task type situations. In this regard the EU Council approved an EU exercise policy and an EU exercise programme for the period 2001-2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_2110">The exercise policy identifies the EU requirements for categories of exercises, including joint exercises with NATO, and will be the basis for the effective implementation of all EU crisis management exercises.

          <p eId="para_2111">The exercise programme covers the period 2001-2006, with a sequence of exercises designed to ensure appropriate readiness and efficient functioning in crisis management. The exercises are designed to ensure the EU structures, procedures including consultation with the UN and arrangements are properly tested and validated to ensure appropriate readiness and efficient functioning in a Petersberg Task type crisis.

          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_2114">In August 2001, I invited Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, to chair an external advisory committee to determine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment, bullying and discrimination and to review existing policies and procedures, and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this whole area. Dr. Doyle was joined by two other civilian experts and by senior military personnel. Dr. Doyle and the external advisory committee group presented their completed report to me in March, 2002. I accepted the report in full together with all of its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_2115">The results of the survey indicated that a significant number of respondents perceived themselves as experiencing unacceptable levels of harassment, bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2116">The key recommendations of the Doyle report are as follows: the introduction of a comprehensive set of policies around issues of harassment, bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, with the active support of the representative associations; a thorough, continuing and multi-faceted education and training programme; a Defence Forces equality steering group should be established, with a Labour Court chairperson; comprehensive exit interviews to examine personnel turnover issues, these interviews to be conducted by an outside independent body; further review and survey in 2004.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_132">The report noted that it would be essential that external civilian expertise be involved throughout the implementation process for the various recommendations. On the evidence of the  research findings, there is a need for immediate action on a number of fronts. The report emphasises the need for continuous external review, including a further external survey in spring 2004, which will involve a thorough revisiting of all the aspects covered in the present report. That second review process in 2004 will also be undertaken for official publication.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">The following action has been taken on foot of the recommendations of the report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_134">First, an independent monitoring group chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle has been established to oversee the implementation of the fundamental reforms which the report has recommended. The monitoring group is meeting regularly to formulate proposals on how best to proceed with implementation of the recommendations. The most significant development is the genuine and growing collaboration between the military authorities, the two representative associations and the Department of Defence in relation to implementing the recommendations. The first stage of disseminating the findings of the report has taken place. A number of focus groups have been set up by the group to identify appropriate ways of enriching training at all levels in the Defence Forces. The members of the monitoring group are Dr. Eileen Doyle (chairperson), the deputy chief of staff (support), an assistant secretary of the Department and the general secretaries of the representative associations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_135">Second, an equality steering group has recently been established and has just begun its deliberations. The equality steering group will ensure that progress is made both in relation to legislative requirements and best working practice. The membership of the equality steering group comprises: Chairperson Patrick Pierce of the Labour Court, chairperson, a departmental and a military representative and representatives from RACO and PDFORRA.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_136">Third, procedures are being put in place to set up a confidential, professionally supported help line and counselling service which would be available to military personnel. It is proposed to launch this service in the next couple of months.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_137">Fourth, the Department has currently engaged an independent consultant to design, administer, distribute and analyse an exit interview questionnaire for Defence Forces personnel.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138">The chief of staff has strongly supported a partnership approach to addressing this issue. He has repeatedly emphasised his acceptance of the problem and has recognised the necessity to tackle this matter in a fundamental way at all levels of the Defence Forces. The chief of staff has demonstrated a very active and genuine commitment to change and has emphasised that it is incumbent on all commanders to ensure that best practice in management of personnel is fostered at all levels to eliminate the problems identified in the Doyle report. I emphasise that bullying is not training for anything. I fully realise that the project of bringing about necessary fundamental changes in attitudes and culture will not be quick  or easy. However, with substantial and vigorous leadership, I have every confidence that the proper environment will be firmly established and maintained throughout the Defence Forces.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2121">In common with other public sector health service providers, the medical corps encounters difficulty in the recruitment and retention of medical personnel. The Department of Defence, in consultation with the director of the medical corps, is endeavouring to seek ways to recruit additional medical personnel, notwithstanding these difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_2122">Competitions are held regularly for the recruitment of medical practitioners and dentists as direct entry commissioned officers in the medical corps.</p>
          <p eId="para_2123">Where medical corps doctors or dentists are not available, suitable local arrangements are made with civilian medical and dental practitioners to ensure that the appropriate level of professional care is available to members of the Defence Forces.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_139">There are 33 medical officers serving in the Defence Forces. The most recent competition to recruit doctors for the medical corps was advertised in March, 2002 and so far has resulted in four applicants. One of these candidates was found suitable but declined an offer of appoint ment, one was found unsuitable and two candidates await interview.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_140">A competition to recruit dentists for the medical corps was advertised in July, 2002 and so far has resulted in three applicants, one of whom is due to be appointed on 6 January, 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_141">The medical corps has been unable to attract more than one or two medical officers per year into the service, and these generally leave the Defence Forces after one or two years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_142">It is suspected that a significant component of the difficulty in attracting suitable applicants may be due to the unique nature of military medical officer appointments. Service in the medical corps is not a professional training employment such as non consultant hospital doctor appointments or vocational training schemes in general practice. Service with the medical corps for a young doctor tends to be seen as a short-term expedient for the experience and challenge of overseas service, rather than as a long-term career option.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143">The Medical Corps incorporates the following service components: a planning and advisory function, aimed at ensuring that the Defence Forces maintain the necessary resources to meet medical eventualities; a training function, aimed at ensuring that the skills identified as being required to carry out all elements of the medical corps function are maintained; the provision of a medical service in peacetime, including a service to peacekeeping operations overseas; and preparedness of a medical service in the eventuality of hostilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">As day to day medical care of personnel must take precedence, resources are provided for the planning, advisory, and training functions, on an as available basis. Within the constraints of available medical manpower, the corps is however, increasing its capacity to support personnel on peace support duties overseas, by the purchase of equipment and training. Personnel are referred to civilian facilities, where necessary, to maintain the required level of medical services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145">The re-organisation of the medical corps, which was effected as part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan in November 1998, was embraced as an opportunity to redirect the focus of military medical care in the Defence Forces from a predominantly hospital based service to one in which primary care, occupational medicine and field support would continue to be further developed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146">At present, in addition to St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin, three military medical facilities (MMF) are located at the headquarters of each of the field medical companies in Cork and Athlone and at the medical detachment supply and services unit in the Curragh. These have associated infirmaries for the care of any living-in personnel (largely recruits and other training course students) who may become injured or ill. There are appointments for a physician at each MMF.</summary>

The main outcome of the various reviews is that the Defence Forces is significantly different in size and in structure from what it was in 1990. It has reduced in strength from 13,500 to 10,500 with up to an additional 250 in training and has fundamentally restructured its organisational components.</p>

Under the terms of this agreement, representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Defence, and the military authorities, met collectively and separately with representatives of PDFORRA and RACO. These meetings were supplemented by a number of bilateral meetings between the various parties. This process ensured the associations were fully aware of developments at the central discussions while at the same time having a forum to raise matters of particular concern to them.</summary>

In addition, the Defence Forces provide the UN, on a quarterly basis, with a detailed status report on the resources offered by Ireland in the format requested by the UN.

          <p eId="para_2146">The pricing of goods or services by businesses is a commercial matter. However, I am aware that transparency is most important to allow consumers choose effec tively when purchasing goods or services. Accordingly, the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1991, requires that the price of both alcoholic and soft drinks be displayed immediately outside or immediately inside each entrance to a licensed premises. The purpose of the order is to ensure that consumers are aware of the prices charged before they enter a licensed premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_2147">I am opposed to the reintroduction of price caps or price control. It is an ineffective and discredited policy instrument. Competition in the licensed trade would be the most effective way of bringing about a reduction in the prices of drinks sold on such premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_2148">A review of the licensing regime is being undertaken by the commission on liquor licensing established in 2001 by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is expected to report in mid-March of 2003. Were that commission to conclude that greater liberalisation in the issuing of liquor licenses is justified, I would expect such a recommendation to be implemented without further delay. That would without doubt give people the benefits of increased competition and a significant reduction in the hugely inflated prices being charged for soft drinks in pubs would inevitably result.</p>

          <p eId="para_2182">The main priority for the Air Corps is the purchase of fixed-wing training aircraft. The tender competition for the acquisition of eight trainer aircraft is going well and the I am hopeful that I will be in a position to make a substantive announcement on the award of the contract before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2183">On the issue of helicopters, it was a matter of great regret to me when the decision was made to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium-lift helicopters for the Air Corps because of the changed financial situation. When the decision was made, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopter services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue, while taking account of the current financial position.</p>
          <p eId="para_2184">An interdepartmental working group has been established to seek alternate solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions. This work is at an early stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_164">I am committed to maintaining the involvement of the Air Corps in search and rescue for the long-term. In this regard, the Air Corps is in the process of acquiring an S61 helicopter to operate in the north west region to replace the  existing Dauphin helicopter. The S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from CHC Ireland Limited pursuant to existing search and rescue contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide the flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by CHCI. The S61 will operate out of Sligo Airport.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_165">Pilot training on the S61, which is being provided by CHCI, is currently ongoing.

          <p eId="para_2186">The disposal of obsolete military equipment takes place on an ongoing basis as the need arises. The disposal of such equipment usually follows from the recommendation from a military board of survey which confirms that the equipment is of no further value to the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_2187">The acquisition of new equipment and the provision of modern accommodation for the Defence Forces has been a key focus for me since my original appointment to the Defence portfolio. Significant investment has taken place which has ensured that the Defence Forces are now well equipped for their roles at home and overseas and that obsolete equipment has been replaced as required.</p>
          <p eId="para_2188">While much has been done both on the equipment and the infrastructure front, I am aware that more needs to be done. While expenditure programmes will now have to be prioritised due to the changed financial situation, I will ensure that a substantive re-equipment programme will still go ahead to enhance the efficiency, professionalism and safety of the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_2189">One example is the position with regard to the acquisition of APCs for the Defence Forces. The original APC contract contains an option for the supply of up to 40 additional APCs by Mowag. This option has now been exercised, albeit for a reduced number of APCs because of the changed financial situation. I signed a contract earlier this week for the provision by Mowag of 25 additional APCs. The contract value is in the region of €33.2 million including VAT. Deliveries will commence in March 2004 and are scheduled to be completed by September 2004. Payments under the contract will extend from December 2002 to September 2005 due to the budgetary situation. On delivery, the Defence Forces will have a total of 65 APCs which meets their requirements in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_2190">In addition, the tender competition for the acquisition of trainer aircraft for the Air Corps is progressing well and I hope to be in a position to make a substantive announcement on the award of a contract before the end of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_2192">Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking or other such illegal activities rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners who are also responsible for the detention of personnel and/or the seizure of drugs or equipment, which may be made at sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_2193">The White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for both the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work. While the main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking. The Air Corps provides air support and on occasion carries the Customs Service national drugs team in an observation capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking or other such illegal activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_2194">There is close co-operation between the civil authorities, the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service and Air Corps in discharging this important mission. I am satisfied that the extent of Naval Service and Air Corps reconnaissance, in conjunction with the Garda and the Customs Service, has had a major and beneficial impact in deterring drug trafficking or other such illegal activities.</p>

          <p eId="para_2216">The animal-based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area based compensatory  allowance scheme. This scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application.

The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement.

In order that she can check the accuracy of the findings at 15 October 2001, arrangements have been  made to issue a herd profile to her which can be expected very shortly. The profile will show the date of birth of each bovine over the age of six months found per CMMS to have been present on the holding on 15 October 2001.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2231">The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system.</p>
          <p eId="para_2232">The person in question submitted an application to the tribunal and it was examined on 29 October. Unfortunately, the tribunal was unable to recommend an allocation in this case. While every application is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner, the amount of quota available for allocation is limited in the context of the large numbers of applications that are submitted and therefore the tribunal is not always in a position to recommend the allocation of quota to an applicant.</p>
          <p eId="para_2233">The tribunal gives priority to the following categories of producers:</p>
          <p eId="para_2234">– small scale producers whose entitlement to purchase quota under recent milk quota restructuring schemes was limited because of animal disease or personal illness or where insufficient quota was available in the applicant's co-operative/dairy;</p>
          <p eId="para_2235">– younger dairy farmers with small milk quotas;</p>
          <p eId="para_2236">– producers whose butterfat representative levels are very low;</p>
          <p eId="para_2237">– producers who are in financial difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_2238">In assessing these applications, the tribunal takes account of the following factors:</p>
          <p eId="para_2239">– current quota size;</p>
          <p eId="para_2240">– off-farm income and/or other farm enterprises;</p>

The interim report for the DCC area has been received and is currently being studied by officials of DCC and the Office of Public Works and a meeting has been arranged between the DCC and my officials for 16 December 2002 to progress the matter.

      the steps taken by Ireland since 1999 to bring about changes to the IMF's poverty reduction and growth facility.
      [26208/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_925">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_2257">The poverty reduction and growth facility, PRGF, of the IMF provides concessional financial assistance to low-income member countries. The facility supports economic programmes designed to foster durable growth, leading to higher living standards and reduced poverty in recipient countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_2258">PRGF-supported programmes are framed around a comprehensive nationally-owned poverty reduction strategy paper, PRSP, prepared by the borrowing government and based on a process involving the active participation of civil society, non-governmental organisations, donors and international institutions. These PRSPs are then endorsed in their respective areas of responsibility by the executive boards of the IMF and the World Bank as the basis for the institutions' concessional loans. At end November 2002, the reform programmes of 39 member countries were being supported by PRGF arrangements, with IMF commitments of almost SDR 4.6 billion – over $6 billion.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_170">The PRGF/PRSP process is a new and complex process introduced only three years ago. In view of this, and given the difficulties arising from both human capacity and data constraints in the ben eficiary countries, it is still evolving. Nevertheless, it has to be recognised that progress is being made and that both the World Bank and IMF are working hard to accelerate it, in consultation with other parties and under the general direction of their respective executive boards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_171">To this end, the most recent IMF progress report, Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers – Progress in Implementation, which was issued in September 2002, highlights the following crucial elements: the institutionalisation of the participatory process and, in particular, the creation of an enabling legal framework for civic engagement in these countries. This is especially valuable in countries that have no tradition of engagement by civil society in the decision-making process; the integration of the PRSP/PRGF process with countries' annual budgets in a realistic macroeconomics framework. This includes the identification of sources of growth and the policies necessary to realise them; incorporating a poverty and social impact analysis in national poverty reduction strategy papers – the bank has developed a draft user guide to PSIA which sets out tools and approaches for staff and country practitioners in this area; improving monitoring and evaluation of results being achieved under PRSPs; implementing the principle that development partners, including the bank and fund, will align their support with the priorities laid out in the PRSP and deliver support more effectively; harmonisation of donor co-ordination efforts to reduce the administrative burden on recipient countries of working with donors; strengthening of countries' public expenditure management systems; and building up the skills and data capacity of countries so as to ensure effective preparation and implementation of PRSPs/PRGFs. In this context, it is to be noted that the World Bank has issued a good practices guide for PRSPs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">Through the executive director's office in the IMF Ireland participates fully in executive board discussions on these matters – and also on individual country cases that come before the board. The basic Irish position is that PRGFs must result in an identifiably increased spending on poverty reduction, that structures should be in place to monitor and verify poverty-targeted expenditure, and that civil society must be fully involved in the preparation of the PRSPs. Ireland has also strongly supported the streamlining of conditionality attaching to PRGF assistance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_173">I would like to point out that in July 2002 Ireland announced a commitment of €1.5 million over three years to the activities of Debt Relief International, a non-profit making organisation which helps developing countries manage their borrowing and their existing debts.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_174">I would also refer the Deputy to the annual reports on Ireland's participation in the World Bank and the IMF.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2260">Prior to the budget announcement on 4 December 2002, there were two provisions of the legislation governing capital gains tax, now the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which allowed deferral of capital gains tax arising on gains from the disposal of certain assets where the proceeds of disposal were re-invested in certain other assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_2261">One of the provisions in place since 1975, and commonly known as roll-over relief, permitted the gain on the disposal of certain assets of a trade to be deferred where the proceeds were reinvested in such assets. The assets concerned included plant and machinery, goodwill of the trade, and land and buildings occupied and used for the purposes of the trade, including farming. Prior to the recent budget announcement, subsequent legislative amendments to the capital gains tax Acts restricted this relief, in the case of a disposal of development land, to disposals of such land for environmental reasons; disposals of such land by an authorised racecourse or authorised greyhound track; disposals of such land to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority; and disposals of such land by an amateur sports body.</p>
          <p eId="para_2262">The other relevant provision allowed a deferral of capital gains tax where property was disposed of under a CPO and the proceeds re-invested in acquiring similar property. Prior to the recent budget announcement, this relief was restricted in the case of a disposal of development land, to land acquired for road construction; and land acquired from an amateur sports body. Neither of these two relieving provisions will now apply in respect of disposals on or after 4 December 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_2263">For capital gains tax purposes, inherited land is acquired at its market value at the date of death of the testator or, if later, its market value at 6 April 1974. The chargeable gain on a subsequent sale of such land is based on the sale price less that value, with an indexation relief applying in respect of inflation. As announced in the recent budget, this indexation for future disposals applies only up to 31 December 2002 and is calculated using an indexation table, which is based upon the consumer price index.</p>

          <p eId="para_2266">With regard to the taxpayer's offer of new employment, a P45 is not a prerequisite for taking up such an offer.

Thus, the certificate issued would be effective from 1 January 2003. In the absence of a certificate, the taxpayer would be put on the emergency tax system by his employer and it will be open to him after the end of the tax year 2002 to apply to Revenue for a balancing statement in relation to that year.</p>

          <p eId="para_2271">The overall objective of Ireland Aid, confirmed by the report of the Ireland Aid Review Committee and endorsed by the Government, is poverty eradication in the world's poorest countries. Ireland Aid's development co-operation activities in its six programme countries in sub-Saharan Africa  are closely aligned with country-owned poverty reduction strategy papers, PRSPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2272">The PRSPs are taken into account by the IMF in the implementation of its poverty reduction and growth facility, PRGF, which is the IMF's low-interest lending facility for poor countries. The PRGF is designed to be supportive of PRSPs and sensitive to their poverty focus. We would not wish to see any conditionalities attached to the PRGF in its implementation which might have the effect of undermining country-owned PRSPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2273">Ireland Aid maintains close contact with the regional representatives of both the IMF and the World Bank and monitors the implementation of PRSPs and PRGFs. We also work closely with the Department of Finance in briefing our national representative in the office of the IMF's executive director in preparation for discussions within the fund on the PRSP/PRGF processes generally and on individual issues considered by the board of the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_2274">In a number of our programme countries, Ireland Aid personnel are involved in discussions with the IMF country director, or other senior officials of the fund, on the PRGF missions in these countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_2275">In July this year, at the launch of the Government's policy on developing country debt, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, announced a commitment of €1.5 million over three years to support the activities of Debt Relief International, a non-profit making organisation which helps developing countries to manage their borrowing and their existing debts. This should increase the latter's capacity to represent their own interests in the PRGF and the PRSP processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2276">We are planning to deepen our own engagement with the IMF and the World Bank over the coming years. This will facilitate closer involvement in monitoring of the PRGF and the PRSP processes.</p>

          <p eId="para_2374">The Christmas bonus was paid this year, as in previous years, to recipients of all long-term social welfare payments including retirement and old age pensioners, widow's, widower's and one-parent families, carers, invalidity pension and disability allowance recipients, persons in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance and farm assist and people on employment support payments. Payment was made in early December to some 1.1 million persons, comprising some 740,000 recipients and an estimated 400,000 dependants. The cost of this measure was estimated to be €103.3 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2375">Recipients of short-term payments do not qualify for the Christmas bonus. Family income supplement is a short-term payment awarded for a period of 12 months only, after which the recipient must re-apply for a further 12 months. Therefore, it does not qualify for the Christmas bonus, the focus of which is on long-term payment recipients.</p>
