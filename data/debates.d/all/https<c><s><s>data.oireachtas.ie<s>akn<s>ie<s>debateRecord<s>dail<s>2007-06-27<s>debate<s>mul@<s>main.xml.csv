#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I hope the Ceann Comhairle's enthusiasm is a little more restrained today.  I did not know the Ceann Comhairle brought his own china shop with him.There is a programme on Channel Four called "Deal or No Deal".  Yesterday, the Taoiseach indicated to the House that he had a political arrangement worked out with three, not four, Independent Members.  I have no reason to doubt the word of Deputy Flynn who, following her meeting with him, stated she had a deal with the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach confirmed yesterday that he has no such deal when responding to questions on the arrangement with other Independent Members, which obviously affect the national development programme, State agencies and priority issues in the Deputies' constituencies.  As far as I can ascertain, RTE is the only State agency that would appear to be affected by any deal with Deputy Flynn having come to an agreement with her to write off a large part of the moneys claimed to be due arising from a court case.  The Taoiseach's comments, before the court case, were quite extraordinary and are causing confusion as to whether this was a part of some deal.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I have no knowledge of and nor have I been in any way involved in Deputy Beverly Flynn's deal, negotiations or settlement with RTE.  She never raised the issue of RTE with me.  In fairness to her, she never mentioned it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I am quite sure the Taoiseach can understand licence payers' outrage.  They see advertisements on the television about the serious consequences of not paying their licence fees.  An amount of money of the size in question may have to go before the RTE Authority, which is appointed in full by the Government.  Will the Government take into account the shortfall that results from the agreement with RTE when the opportunity next arises?On the day the Taoiseach was elected, Deputy Flynn commented that she had tied down a very generous verbal agreement with him just hours before the vote for Taoiseach took place and that she was very pleased with what was agreed.  She went on to say that she had no comment to make on it but that all would become apparent shortly.  The Taoiseach was elected on 14 June and gave an interview on 15 June.  Matters became apparent shortly after that when RTE suddenly agreed to waive an amount of money due to it.  Deputy Flynn, the veracity of whose comments I have no reason to doubt, says she has a deal with the Taoiseach.  However, the Taoiseach says he has no deal with her.  Is there a deal or is there no deal?  Somebody is not telling the truth.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	28	There are two matters to be addressed.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach flatly refused to advise the House of the details of the secret agreements he reached with a number of Independent Deputies.  He has refused to lay that information before the House other than to say that they involve nothing that was not already in the Fianna Fáil programme.  In the meantime, the Deputies concerned are claiming that they have got projects for their constituencies worth hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money.  I want to ask the Taoiseach a question that is fundamentally important for democracy.  Will the terms of these secret deals be laid before the House?  Second, why did the Taoiseach deny he has an agreement with Deputy Beverly Flynn?  Deputy Flynn stated on 15 June:I am absolutely delighted with what I have secured for Mayo.  Bertie Ahern has verbally agreed a very generous package for the county and I will be supporting him for the vote for Taoiseach this afternoon.  I do not have a signed agreement; I did not seek one.  I fully accept the word of the Taoiseach.  I do not need to be waving about a piece of paper.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Who is telling the truth and who is telling the untruths or have we reached the stage where we are unable to see the distinction?  Either Deputy Flynn has an agreement with the Taoiseach or she does not.Why did the Taoiseach feel it necessary to intervene in the extraordinary fashion in which he did, including holding out the prospect of office to this Deputy who was expelled from the parliamentary party and the Fianna Fáil Party?  How, for example, must Deputy Séan Ardagh feel given his service in this House and the distinction with which he served as a committee chairman?  Following the Taoiseach's extraordinary intervention, despite three years of stasis in regard to this case on the part of RTE, RTE suddenly settled the case.  The Taoiseach has told Deputy Kenny that is a coincidence.Will the Taoiseach lay the agreements before the House?  Is Deputy Flynn publicly telling an untruth when she says she has a deal with the Taoiseach?  Can we see the terms of that deal?  Can the Taoiseach explain the coincidence between RTE quickly settling this case and his extraordinary intervention?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Three points, not two, were raised and I will try to answer them.  The written understandings I have with the three Deputies concerned are based on the national development plan, Transport 21, the multi-annual programmes and the Book of Estimates.  As I stated yesterday, some €187 billion is provided for in the national development plan; €34 billion in Transport 21 and we spend approximately €52 billion annually on the capital programmes and the current budget deficit.  There is considerable resources within those figures.  As I stated yesterday I am committed, as Taoiseach, to implementing as many of the programmes as I can based on those understandings.  That is the position.In regard to Deputy Flynn, her wish, and that of every Member on this side of the House, is to see all these programmes implemented.  She is as anxious as any other Deputy that this is done.  She has not raised any other issue or sought agreement in writing on the issues raised.  She did not ask for a written agreement; she understands that is the position.

I had no discussion on or involvement in that matter.This is not a cute issue for the Opposition to raise.  Many of the new Deputies have no experience of this House and having to listen to their Leaders imply that a Taoiseach would ask a State company——

It does not matter, except to highlight the foolishness of the Deputies concerned, if the Taoiseach is correct in saying the agreements are encompassed in the national development plan or Transport 21 and that the concessions are to be granted in any event.  Whatever is the case, the House is entitled to see the terms of those agreements.  We will continue to pursue the matter with the Taoiseach until he lays them before the House.During the interview, Deputy Flynn added that the deal was confidential.  She stated:I know the Mayo electorate will see it as very generous.  I cannot comment any further about what is contained in the deal at this time but I am really delighted and I fully trust Bertie Ahern to deliver as promised.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	43	She just has this good feeling on behalf of Mayo.  If she got as little for Mayo as the Taoiseach says, the people of Mayo got a very bad deal.  However, the Taoiseach holds out the prospect of Deputy Flynn being made a Minister.  That must be causing immense puzzlement on the Government backbenches.  It is an extraordinarily timed intervention.  I do not know who the Taoiseach says is claiming that he intervened with RTE.  I merely point to the timing of an extraordinary public interview, followed a couple of days later by RTE caving in.  If one believes in the tooth fairy one can say that was a coincidence, but there is a qualitative difference between RTE pursuing an Independent Deputy and being required to pursue and bankrupt someone who is a member of Fianna Fáil and for whom the prospect of office is being held out.  The Taoiseach should not assume that his new Deputies or new Deputies on the Opposition side of the House are so naive that they cannot put two and two together.Is there a deal with Deputy Flynn or was she telling an untruth when she gave that interview to the media?  Is there an agreement or is there not and when are we going to see the terms of it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I do not think any Deputy who is in discussions with the Government is either naive or silly.  People want to see projects in the national development plan, Transport 21 or the multi-annual capital and current programmes implemented.  Deputy Rabbitte knows that while those projects are spread over a seven-year period, people will want to prioritise them, as every Member on my own side and the Opposition side would want to do.  That is what people fight and negotiate for.  One should not pretend that everything in the national plan will be implemented seriatim and easily without people fighting their corner or making a case for favourite projects.  That is something that happens every day.

There are similar issues in the national development plan.  I would be amazed if Deputy Flynn did not support such proposals and was not glad to see them.  They are the kind of proposals in which she is interested.  She does not need to have them in writing because she sees them in the national development plan.  Other Deputies required them in writing.

I was asked, if those matters were resolved, would she have a future in my party, having spent ten years in the House supporting my party, even when she was not a member of it.  I remind Deputy Rabbitte that she is not a member of the party.  I suggested that I believed her future is in the Fianna Fáil Party.  As to whether she would have the capability, like many of my other colleagues, to be an office holder in future, yes, she would.  I am in the lucky position that I have 50 or 60 people capable of holding such a position.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, together.I travelled to Berlin on 31 May for a meeting with Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Reinfeldt of Sweden.  This meeting was a part of a series of consultations by Chancellor Merkel with prime ministerial colleagues in advance of the Presidency report to the June European Council.  Our discussions focused in particular on preparation for the European Council and the prospects for the constitutional treaty.I attended the European Council on 21, 22 and 23 June in Brussels, accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs.  As I will make a statement to the House on the Council later this morning, at this stage I will merely give a summary account of its proceedings.Discussions at the Council focused primarily on the Presidency's proposals on the treaty reform process and suggestions for the way forward.  In its report to the Council, the Presidency put forward a proposal that a reform treaty be introduced which would amend the existing treaties.  The reform treaty will retain the balance and substance of the draft EU constitutional treaty concluded during the Irish Presidency in 2004.The Council agreed on a mandate for a short intergovernmental conference, IGC, which will commence during the Portuguese Presidency.  The discussions included significant political questions, such as those on voting weights and the charter of fundamental rights; an agreed approach to these and other issues was adopted in the Council's conclusions.  The IGC will be tasked with elaborating the reform treaty based on the mandate agreed by the European Council.On other matters, the European Council congratulated Malta and Cyprus on their accession to the euro area and we adopted a number of important conclusions concerning the Union's ongoing and external relations business.  We adopted an EU strategy for a new partnership with central Asia.  This strategy will serve as an overall framework for EU relations with central Asia.  A first progress report on the strategy will be submitted to the European Council by the middle of 2008.Within the realm of justice and home affairs, the Council welcomed the progress already made in implementing the priority actions as part of the global approach to migration, and called for work on these priority actions to be taken forward and intensified.  We agreed to review the state of implementation of the comprehensive migration policy at the December European Council meeting.The protracted debate on the reform treaty meant that time available for other topics was limited.  Nonetheless, the conclusions recorded that the European Council welcomed the recent engagement between the President of the Commission and the new Northern Ireland executive and underlined the European Union's longstanding and continuing support for the peace process.The President of the European Commission attended the European Council as normal and was a full party to the discussions.  There are no plans for any further bilateral meetings.I will make a detailed statement to the House shortly regarding the European Council.  I have not yet received an agenda for the October European Council.  Regarding my travel plans for the remainder of 2007, I propose to attend the informal meeting of the European Council in Lisbon on 18-19 October and the European Council in Brussels on 13-14 December.  A wider programme of official visits, taking account of Ireland's strategic international interests, is currently under consideration.

Can he assure the Irish people that there will be only one referendum on this revised EU treaty, that the Government will abide by the verdict irrespective of the verdict delivered and that it will implement it accordingly?  Can the Taoiseach guarantee that there will be no repeat of the travesty of democracy that ensued when the people spoke in the first Nice treaty referendum and he forced a second poll?Will the Government pursue an opt-out on state aid provisions at the forthcoming EU governmental conference to overcome the legacy of partition and build a vibrant all-Ireland economy?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the state aid provisions are overly restrictive and make it almost impossible for member states to make use of targeted state funding to full effect regarding reaching objectives on balanced regional development?  I am referring particularly to infrastructural deficits in the Border region.  The Taoiseach clearly has a considerable mandate to address these deficits and introduce relevant measures.  Will the Taoiseach seek an opt-out on state aid provisions at the EU governmental conference given his stated intent, and the mandate he has secured for a third time, will be thwarted by the measures contained in that element?Can the Taoiseach explain how the introduction of an EU Foreign Minister, a so-called high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, could be consistent with the neutral and independent status of this State?  How will the Government relate to this new position in its dealings with the European Union and other member states?  How will the new position square with our independent position on foreign policy and the role of our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I do not want to go back over old ground but the second Nice treaty referendum contained a civil declaration that constituted a significant change from the first agreement.  This change was widely supported by those interest groups that had difficulties with the first referendum and this should not be forgotten.  The referenda were not the same as the change was negotiated and sanctioned by the European Council and attached to the Nice treaty to meet the requirements of this country with the agreement of our political system.State aids are part of the Internal Market and, from time to time, negotiations on such issues take place — there is no question of us opting out of state aid rules as to do so would not be in our interests.  Sometimes we have arguments with the Commission on advantages specific to us but the Internal Market brings us many benefits.  It is not feasible to opt out of one particular aspect of the Internal Market.Regarding foreign affairs issues, there have been movements away from the concept of a European constitution and it is now a reform treaty.  Many of the trappings of the constitution treaty, Article No. 8 and others, have been deleted as has the concept of a Foreign Ministry for the entire EU, as originally envisaged.  The treaty now strengthens the European Union's ability to act on the world stage in support of our shared values and objectives and it does so by enhancing the coherence and effectiveness of the EU's external relations.  Notably it seeks to appoint an EU high representative on foreign affairs and security policy, a position not too different from that currently held by Javier Solana.  It will enable the Union to develop capabilities for conflict prevention and crisis management while ensuring, in our case, that any arrangements are fully consistent with Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality and, in the case of other countries, that they have control over their own arrangements, consistent with their constitutional and legal position.  The concept of the Foreign Affairs Minister, as it was, is now amended.

As a Border Deputy I am very concerned and I am sure people from the west and midlands will join Border voices in the House in asking how the Taoiseach intends to overcome the difficulties that will present.  We are keen to see a correction of the failure to direct critical capital investment into our areas.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The state aid rules do not prevent us from enhancing regional development.  We are entitled to give higher state aid to locations outside the greater Dublin area and have been doing so for some time.  It is correct that state aids create conflict on projects from time to time and it is for us to negotiate those issues and argue our case on them.  We had a very high level case about two years ago where we had differences of opinion with the Commission.  The problem the Deputy has is that there are areas to which we need to attract investment and where we need to try to win supports for winning foreign direct investment or, for that matter, indigenous investment.  Much of the time these matters are within our own capabilities to negotiate and resolve.  Perhaps there is an argument on some of those issues and I take the Deputy's point that we have to try to help areas that are disadvantaged or have high unemployment levels.  However, opting out of internal market provisions would not be the way to achieve his goal.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	66	To return to the Nice treaty, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Éamon Ó Cuív, admitted he voted against the first Nice treaty.  I understand the Green Party Ministers must put the terms of the proposed referendum to the party's membership and it will probably require another convention in the Mansion House to decide whether they, as members of the Government, give support to the revised treaty.  Has the Taoiseach discussed the matter with his Cabinet?  May we assume the revised treaty will be fully supported by all members of the Cabinet and the Government will make a real effort to ensure resources are made available and proper provision is made for debating the issues arising from the revised treaty, which are very important for the future of the country and Europe?  Will the Government give priority to this issue and provide resources to the National Forum on Europe and so on to ensure proper political interaction takes place on the issues involved?  I do not know whether the Taoiseach has spoken to the Green Party members of Government.The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is of central importance to the treaty, has been removed from the text but its legal status is unaltered.  Will the Taoiseach explain whether the British decision to seek an opt-out in respect of the charter of fundamental rights is the reason we have adopted a somewhat cautious position on this matter?  Why are we afraid to say we support the Charter of Fundamental Rights and want it included in the text because it is an important selling point for the treaty?  The Taoiseach has made the point that he would have preferred the wording in the original text.  Will he explain why this is so, given that for national and other reasons this was turned down in the Netherlands and in France?  Also, as the Taoiseach will be aware, the difficulties arising from the Polish delegation and a number of other new-member eastern countries are quite contentious.  Obviously, compromise will have to be achieved by the leaders before this will pass.Is it the Taoiseach's view that the new British Prime Minister, and perhaps the French President, will seek to have the revised treaty passed by parliamentary majority as opposed to having to hold a referendum which might, for any reason, be contentious again the next time?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Deputy asked a number of questions and I will try to answer them all.  The title "reform treaty" is good because it is a reforming treaty.  It is necessary because the Union is far bigger than when the current rules were designed.  Some 90% or more of the treaty is the same as the constitutional treaty, and I understand the two reasons the other 10% or less was removed.  On one side, this was done to deal with the issue of constitutional symbolism and, on the other side, it was done to satisfy the French and Dutch positions, as their voters said "no".Frankly, I do not have much time for the argument about symbolism.  The idea that the people of Europe will stop having respect for the anthem, stop carrying the European logo on their cars or stop having European flags because certain parts are in or out of the treaty is nonsense.  The Deputy will know from his group that I have made this point in the discussions.  However, that is not the real reason — we should be straight about that, as I am being, because we are better off being honest on these issues.  The real reason they wanted that part removed was because doing so made it easier for them to be able to say to their parliaments that they do not have to hold a referendum.  With the symbolism removed, they can justify the point that it is not a constitutional treaty and, therefore, can be ratified by parliament.  There is no doubt that is what they will do.  It is not for any other reason.I have no problem whatever with helping our colleagues in France and the Netherlands on the issues that created difficulty for them.  To do otherwise would be unfair.  When I was in a similar position, I got the Seville declaration, which I had to get from my colleagues.  Therefore, I have no problem making those compromises and amendments.  I just divide the two reasons that apply to this issue.On the charter, it is not just the UK position that is at issue.  Everybody is in favour of the charter, although the UK has a different position to the others.  However, they were all in favour of the charter being removed from the treaty while being linked to it in a legal way.  I do not believe that makes a damn of a difference.  In fact, it was to be left out of the convention in the first case.  I was in favour of leaving it out at that time because it was making the constitutional treaty enormously bulky.  It was not necessary to include it and easier to leave it as a number of annexes to the treaty.However, let us be clear that we have been supportive of the charter throughout the negotiations since it was introduced in 2000 and following its amendment in 2004.  We were satisfied with the manner in which the charter was incorporated into the draft constitutional treaty in 2004, although that was not my preference at that time.  We would have been happy to have it retained in the reformed treaty but, unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain consensus on it because of issues in a number of countries.  Its legal standing will, however, be confirmed in the new treaty, which is the key point.  It is confirmed in the new treaty, has the same legal value as the treaties and applies to all areas embraced by the European Union where the member states apply European law.  That is the crucial point.The British protocol was introduced at a late stage in the negotiations on Friday night.  We have no difficulty with the scope and application of the charter.  I have been through this over seven years and we have no problem with it.  Nevertheless, we considered it necessary and prudent to look for an opportunity to study the implications of the protocol.  That is all I did on Friday night.  I said the British were bringing in a late protocol and I wanted to be able to study what it means.  While we continue to examine the technical implications of the protocol, although I have asked legal experts to examine it because the legal draft was produced by the United Kingdom and put in late for negotiation, we are satisfied that the text of the charter and the wording to be included in the treaty appear to adequately define the scope and application of the charter.  Unless there is some legal complication or reason, it does not create any difficulty for us, but we must study it.Some other issues were raised by the French and they do not create any difficulty for us.  We were happy with the provisions of the JHA agreement in 2004.  The United Kingdom indicated it could no longer sign up to that deal and the Presidency subsequently proposed a procedure that has become known as the "emergency brake".  That is included in the treaty and it enables any member state to block agreement if it believes the fundamental aspects of its legal system are being affected.  We have a similar legal system to the UK and as a result we keep ourselves linked to the UK with regard to JHA issues.  It would be unwise of us not to do so.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The point is that the charter on fundamental rights is a cornerstone of the social protection architecture within the European Union and is a major factor in prospective support for the constitution as it stood among a large swathe of people here.  Is the Taoiseach saying that publicly expressed reservations about the Government seeking to reserve its position on the opt-out are not well founded?  We read — not from the Taoiseach's briefings admittedly because he did not refer to this after the summit — from briefings from EU officials, who confirmed last night that Ireland and Poland had both sought to reserve the right to follow Britain in opting out of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Is that the case?  If it is not, what is the sense of us reserving our position?Do I take it from what the Taoiseach said that we will have to have a referendum and when is it proposed to hold that referendum?  Is it not the case that if there is doubt on the issue, a significant share of the population will be put off by that?  What is the point of us reserving our position?Has the Taoiseach had confirmation from his partners in Government that they will support what has emerged?  Has he had discussions with his Progressive Democrats colleague and the "Green" Ministers,  an unfortunate term if we continue to use it through the lifetime of the Dáil?  However, they will sharpen up as it goes on, I imagine.  Has the Taoiseach asked the Green Ministers if they will support what has now emerged in respect of what was known as the constitution?  Does he know how many other countries must hold a referendum?  Will he clarify that the Government does not seek any other opt-outs?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I hope that not only all the Government parties but all the parties in the House will support the reform treaty.  I will work towards achieving this in my preliminary discussions.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Does the Taoiseach know?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I am confident that we will achieve that position.I will deal with the point about the charter first.  I fully support the charter and have done for the past seven years.  I fully supported its being part of the full agreement but we were not going to reach consensus on that issue.  Several countries wanted it to be separate.  It will, however, have the same legal status as the treaties and applies to all areas embraced by the Union and where member states apply EU law.  That position is clear and from a legal point of view we are happy with the charter.Late in the day the United Kingdom introduced a complex legal document setting down its opt-out on the charter.  Late on Friday night I asked for legal advice on this document.  The preliminary advice I received, which I appreciate was given late at night, was that this would not create a difficulty for us but that we would need to examine it closely.  This applied not only to what the British sought but to how the European Court of Justice might ultimately interpret the British position.  We did not get a formal opt-out but there is a note in the treaty where I state that I want to have this issue examined.  The Polish issue is separate.My legal advice since Friday has been exactly the same as it was then.  This position must be carefully examined.  The British have some reason for submitting it late.  It was not drafted late.  They had prepared the document and wanted to introduce it.  I am assured that the new treaty will not remove anything from the charter as it concerns us.  I am used to the British coming in with these late protocols and I would like to see how it might affect us and other countries in any judgment of the European Court of Justice.  We will see what the outcome will be but I understand that it will not create a difficulty for us as of now.I imagine that few countries will hold a referendum.  Having removed the constitutional trappings from the treaty our colleagues will try to avoid holding a referendum.  The French President made it clear in his election campaign that he would not put it to the people.  The Dutch worked hard to arrive at that position but have not agreed on it yet.  The Danes have not agreed a position.  Most of the other countries, 20 or more, have no intention of having more than parliamentary ratification, as they have in most such issues.Of the 19 countries that signed up only four held a referendum, while the other 15 had already secured parliamentary ratification of the constitution.  Of the four who held a constitutional referendum, I do not think Luxembourg, France or Spain will hold another one.  Very few countries will hold such a referendum.

I am not sure why we seek to be associated with the Polish in reserving our position on the opt-out.Deputy Gormley, as he then was, opposed the constitution.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I will clarify the position for Deputy Allen, who asked whether there is a formal opt-out or a derogation.  There is not.  When the British inserted a protocol I sought, as I would always do in these issues, legal advice.  That advice is that it is unlikely there are circumstances where that protocol would affect Ireland.  That is clear, but the position is not as clear whereby the European Court of Justice subsequently examines the charter whose remit has the same legal effect as the treaties and applies to all areas embraced by the European Union and where member states apply European Union law.  That is the key issue.  If the European Court of Justice subsequently examines the charter, which it inevitably will do, it is not clear whether it would decide that the British protocol applies to countries other than Britain.  It is not a question of it applying to us, but to all countries.The legal advice is that that needs to be examined in detail.  I assume it is not just an issue for us, but in the convention, and I will raise it there.  Otherwise the position could arise where we would all sign up to the charter, but when it is challenged in a few years time on some issue the European Court of Justice would say that it looks at everything in the round rather than just at the reform treaty. It considers protocols, such as the one allowing for the British opt-out.  The question is whether that takes effect.  It is a legal point but is an important point.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Does the British protocol affect other member states?

I said I wanted to return to that at the convention and I will do that.  Having much experience of these matters, I am always deeply suspicious of the British legal team, which is a very large team, coming into the meeting in the early hours of the morning, presenting a pre-drafted legal protocol and saying that it is only for Britain and it affects nobody else.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I have learned.  It is on that basis I said I would examine it.  The procedure is that if I left it go, I would not be able to raise that issue in the IGC in the formal way I wanted to do so.  It is no more than that.  My experience of these issues is that one has to make things absolutely clear.  The legal position is that it does not create any difficulty for Ireland, but I am not satisfied yet about the other question which the Deputy picked up correctly.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	87	It is no wonder the Green Party did not get much out of the Taoiseach.

Will it be held before next summer or after next summer?  Will the Forum on Europe be properly resourced?  There needs to be a real intent to have a political dialogue about this because it is fundamental to the future of Ireland and Europe.The reason given for the non-inclusion of the charter in the treaty is that it will make the treaty too bulky.  Was any other reason advanced?  There are thousands of European documents that are very extensive, some of them containing 50,000 pages.  Was the Taoiseach happy with the compromise with Poland on the voting issue?  At the European People's Party meeting which I attended the day before the Heads of Government meeting, there was quite an amount of strident comment about the position adopted by Poland in its claim for extra voting facilities.  The Poles felt they were being steamrolled by other countries.  What was Ireland's view on that and is the Taoiseach happy with the resolution of the issue?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I assume we will have to have a referendum, but I will check with our legal advisers.  The IGC should be finished by Christmas, although the Portuguese Presidency has said it will be finished by the end of October.  I wish the Portuguese well on that, but they will start it in the second half of July, so maybe it will be achieved.  It seems unduly optimistic.  The idea is that this will take effect for the European elections in 2009, so we will need a referendum in 2008.  I will consult with the political parties because we need everybody's support to get the reformed treaty passed before May 2009.  The ratification period for the European Parliament will end some months before that, possibly in late 2008 or March 2009, so we must have the referendum before that.The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights was not meant to be in the treaty at the original IGC.  I do not think it was omitted for any other reason than it would make the document more complex than it needed to be.  The key point was that if the charter was not in the treaty, it would still have the same legal effect as the treaties, even though it was not in the document.  It would still embrace all areas of European law where member states apply such law.  That was the crucial legal line for ETUC and others who have taken a great interest in this for the last seven or eight years.  I have always supported that and whether it is in the treaty makes no difference once that line applies.The negotiations surrounding the Polish position were not a model for good negotiations.  As the night drifted on, different colleagues were talking to the Polish President, who spoke with the Polish Government in Warsaw which was in session.  It was a good way how not to do things.  In the Nice treaty, Poland was very close to Germany in votes.  After the Nice treaty, Germany had a far higher number of votes.  Spain accepted that position three years ago and did not go back to it.  The Poles went back to their old position.  It is rare to see a vote in the European Councils on such issues.  Therefore, it was not about votes but about history.  It was about their relationship with others.  It was about the fact that they thought they would be walked on, that their point of view was not taken into account.  It was about all of those issues rather than procedural issues.It was Jean-Claude Juncker who came up with what effectively is an arrangement which means that Nice for the Poles is extended, if they wish it to be so, and that they can go back to this square root position if they so wish.  Personally, I think it is daft.  If it helps good solutions on the night — I think it is a complex position — it has no great effect other than extending their right to hold on until the spring meeting of 2017 to a position, which otherwise would have been gone in 2010.  I doubt they will want to use it between now and 2027.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I am glad the Taoiseach has clarified the position on the derogation because the media and one of the social partners, the trade union movement, understood he had got a derogation on the charter.  As he clarified the position and stated that he must look at the legal implications of the charter proposals from the UK, could I ask him how long the legal examination will take and when he will give full and wholehearted support for the charter?Second, we all knew that there was an imminent referendum, whether on the EU constitution or the draft treaty.  I am surprised that during the two weeks of negotiations between his party and the Green Party, the Taoiseach did not get a commitment from his partners now in Government that they would support the referendum on either the EU constitution or the draft treaty, and I would ask the Taoiseach to clarify the position.I did not hear the Taoiseach's full report on the European Council, but the Single Market seemed to have been ignored in the ongoing controversy regarding the treaty.  What proposals are there for the further development of the Single Market?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I stated I am confident that everyone will support the reform treaty.To prevent anyone reading this record thinking I did not raise the question, I reiterate that I am totally in support of the charter.  I just want to ensure that the implications of the British protocol, which was tabled late and legally and carefully drafted, do not affect other countries, not only Ireland but all other countries because, normally, in the case of a ruling on any matter the European Court of Justice, ECJ, does not merely look at the treaty.  Not alone does the ECJ look at the treaty, it looks at protocols, opt-outs and even footnotes.  When it comes to form a judgment it is a little like what happens here, where when the courts look at what is written in an Act, they will look at what a Minister stated in his Second Stage speech and how he interpreted that section.  The European Court of Justice does not operate differently.  That is why I am very wary of these long protocols which the British have a long-standing habit of submitting stating that they are merely for Britain and affect nobody else.  I have formed that view from experience of how it works.On the Single Market, as Deputy Allen will be aware, there are robust and substantive provisions within the treaty which provide the legal basis for competition within the Union and there was quite a debate about the issue of competition.  It is highly unlikely that any of these matters will have significant implications for the operation of the Single Market.  The French President has a view on competition.  Although he is not against it, his view is that issues of jobs and growth should take precedence and competition is the means rather than the end, according to his phrase in English.  None of the discussion that took place will have significant implications for the operation of the Single Market.

Given that the Blair to Brown transfer of power has been consummated and we see the creation of the Middle East peace envoy position that is likely to be taken up by Tony Blair, is there a prospect that the creation of a high representative role for the EU in respect of foreign policy and security might dovetail with the Taoiseach's transfer of power to the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and his vacating the position of Taoiseach in the House?

The Taoiseach stated that this would be taken in the context of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, but we will not know how the ECJ will interpret the British position until a case comes before it.  Will the Attorney General provide the legal advice or does the Taoiseach expect the legal advice to come from the intergovernmental conference in July?  Will whatever referendum is proposed have clarity in respect of this issue?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I will hear the Attorney General's view but would also like to hear the view of the Council secretariat.  It can draw on much practice and precedent to form a judgment on this issue.  The preliminary view is that it poses no difficulty but I would like to see the matter taken into account.  When examining a case, the ECJ does not just consider how it affects European law in the countries that have signed up for it, but also the implications of an opt-out clause.  This should not cause any difficulty but I would like this to be crystal clear.

Employment in the construction sector is already beginning to fall.  A further fall in construction employment, which is almost inevitable, will have particularly dire consequences for regional areas which lack alternative employment opportunities because the outgoing Government allowed job losses across regional towns to be camouflaged by the then buoyant construction sector.

Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 6, statements on the European Council, agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 2, Finance (No. 2) Bill 2007 — Committee and Remaining Stages, agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	110	It is not agreed.  Only 45 minutes are allowed for this important legislation.  Yesterday I made the point that the Government should not introduce guillotine motions in dealing with important matters or a Bill.  This is an issue on which a number of Members wish to speak and it is one of significant economic importance to many parts of the country.  I object to the proposal on that basis.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Regardless of the reasons for guillotine motions in the dying days of the last Government, which I do not think were strong even then in terms of the scrutiny of legislation, it is wrong in the first week of the life of this Government that we should be presented with two guillotine motions, as is the case today.  I oppose the proposal.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I also object to the proposal to guillotine the debate on Committee, Report and Final Stages of the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  The import of what is involved requires greater scrutiny and opportunities for Deputies to participate but the proposal simply will not accommodate the range of opinion represented in the House.  The Minister for Finance, in his contribution yesterday, clearly indicated that he had capitulated to the position adopted by other parties prior to the general election.  This matter needs to be properly addressed.  The proposal will not resolve the issue for those who need to secure a home for their own purposes.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	113	This is a two section Bill.  We have made an important commitment which we want to honour as quickly as possible.  The issue has been well debated in recent months.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	115	We made the point that there should be no guillotining of business.  This is the first week of the new Dáil and this is the fourth guillotine motion.  I realise this is a procedural matter.  However, I make the point strongly that the Government Whip should not bring forward guillotine motions and object on that basis.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I oppose this proposal.  The Cabinet Handbook makes plain that "Any Bill introduced or presented by or on behalf of a member of the Government, other than a Bill dealing with Budgetary or Estimates matters, should be accompanied by an Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to explain in simple, non-technical language, the provisions of the Bill, setting out the existing law and the changes therein proposed by the Bill and providing information about the estimated Exchequer costs and staffing implications for Departments...".  This is a mandatory requirement in the case of Government Bills, according to the Cabinet Handbook.  It is mandatory to have an accompanying explanatory memorandum detailing the costs and staffing implications.  That has not been done in respect of this Bill.  For that reason, I oppose the proposal.

A number of matters need to be attended to in order to make this House more relevant.  These include making the proceedings of the Dáil, Seanad and Oireachtas committees available to the public, which is now technically feasible at no cost.  During the course of the last Dáil, the Chief Whip brought forward some proposals but they were not implemented.  At the start of his third term, does the Taoiseach intend to introduce a programme of Dáil reform that is relevant?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I attended the European Council on 21 and 22 June and into the morning of 23 June, in Brussels.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche.The conclusions of the European Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The highlight of the Council was the agreement of a detailed mandate for an Intergovernmental Conference, IGC.  This represents a very considerable achievement for the European Union.  It shows our ability to function coherently and effectively with 27 members to resolve issues that have troubled the Union for a number of years.  The new treaty will provide the institutional structures and operating principles to deliver for the people of Europe in the decades ahead.Before going into detail, I want to express my appreciation for the tireless work of the German Presidency and, above all, the President of the European Council, Chancellor Angela Merkel.  Her commitment, patience, fairness and her enduring determination to achieve agreement paid dividends in the end.  At a number of moments during the negotiations, it seemed that we would not agree unanimously on the outcome.  The Presidency, however, was able to secure agreement on a mandate acceptable to all 27 member states.The agreement of the IGC mandate was by no means the only success of the Council.  We first convened in the form of the Council in the composition of Heads of State and Government, joined by the president of the European Central Bank, to discuss and agree on the accession of Malta and Cyprus to the euro.  I am very pleased that we will share a currency with Cyprus and Malta from January next, bringing the number of countries within the euro area to 15.  This will benefit the tens of thousands of Irish people who travel to these countries each year.The Council adopted a set of conclusions which deals with the Union's ongoing agenda, including in the area of freedom, security and justice, notably in relation to migration and strengthening cross-border police co-operation.  In the social, economic and environmental area the Council underlined the need for further progress on the Internal Market and looked forward to the Commission's Single Market review to be published in the autumn.  Ireland will continue to support a deepening of the Single Market as this review progresses.Significantly, the Council welcomed the outcome of the G8 summit in Germany on combating climate change, in particular, the commitment to the UN process and reducing emissions by at least 50% by 2050.  This is an area where, following decisions taken at the spring European Council, the European Union is providing real global leadership and must continue to do so.The Council also adopted conclusions in the external relations area, including on neighbourhood policy and relations with Africa.  I am pleased to report that the Council conclusions welcome the recent engagement between the President of the Commission and the new Northern Ireland Executive and underline the European Union's long-standing and continuing support for the peace process.Going into the European Council, the prospects for success did not look promising and there were a number of difficult issues to be resolved.  Ireland's approach to the negotiations was to preserve as much as possible of what was agreed in 2004.  We did not want a new negotiation to be launched which might take years to complete and raise issues which would have been very difficult to resolve.  Our main concern was to ensure any changes required to accommodate the concerns of other member states would not undermine the balance and substance of the constitutional treaty negotiated in 2004.  Finally, after one or two moments where the atmosphere became very difficult, the Council reached agreement on the mandate which is contained in the conclusions laid before the House.The mandate for the IGC provides for the negotiation of a reform treaty which will differ in form from the European constitutional treaty.  At the same time, perhaps 90% of the substantive package remains unaltered from the European constitutional treaty.  I will report on the key changes for which the mandate provides.The constitutional phrasing and symbolism which featured in the 2004 treaty are no longer being pursued.  Similarly, the treaty will no longer be a single, consolidated text but a traditional amending treaty, that is, a set of amendments to existing treaties.In relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights which the Government supported throughout, we would have been happy to have it retained in the reform treaty.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to secure a consensus on this.  It will, however, have the same legal value as the treaties and apply to all areas embraced by the European Union and where the member states apply European Union law.  At the behest of the United Kingdom, a protocol on the charter was introduced at a very late stage in the negotiations relating to its scope in UK law.  Although we have no difficulty with the scope and application of the charter, I nevertheless considered it necessary and prudent to seek an opportunity to study the implications of the protocol.  While we will continue to examine the technical implications, we are satisfied that the text of the charter and the wording to be included in the treaty appear to adequately define the scope and application of the charter.  We did not seek an "opt-out" from the charter, nor did we seek inclusion of a footnote in the draft mandate recording any reservations.  We simply indicated that we wished to study the implications of the UK position.The title of "Foreign Minister" contained in the constitutional treaty has been changed to "High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy".  The new system of double majority voting in co-decision matters, where 55% of the countries representing 65% of the citizens must approve a measure, will not now come into force until 2014 and if any member state so wishes, it can be further deferred until 2017.  The role of national parliaments has been considerably increased, with the so-called "yellow card" procedure much strengthened.  The scope of the treaty's provisions on the environment is to be broadened with the inclusion of a specific reference to combating climate change, a measure I had specifically sought.With regard to police and criminal judicial co-operation, it was decided to speed up the operation of the emergency brake procedure.  This allows a member state to refer a criminal law proposal to the European Council if it is concerned that the fundamental principles of its legal system would be adversely affected.  Alongside this are measures to facilitate enhanced co-operation where general consensus cannot be achieved.It was also agreed that the UK should not be automatically bound by police or criminal co-operation proposals and that it would be entitled to exercise an opt-out in regard to them.  Given the similarities between our legal system and that of the UK, Ireland has been given the option of following the UK's lead in the criminal law and police co-operation area.  We will examine this issue carefully in the coming period.  We will need to weigh up our general reluctance to take opt-outs against the issues arising from our being part of a JHA co-operation if the UK is not.  The issue is under active consideration and a decision will be made in due course.There has been much comment on whether the importance of competition within the Internal Market has been diminished.  Competition remains a critical feature of a properly functioning Internal Market.  While language relating to the Union's objectives has been altered somewhat, the robust and substantive clauses on competition within the treaties remain unaltered.  They have served us well for many years and will continue to do so.There will also be a protocol on public services which gives greater recognition to the variation of circumstances which can affect the delivery of public services, including geographical, social and cultural situations.  The provision on primacy of European law in the constitutional treaty will be replaced by a declaration referring to European jurisprudence in this area which, as the House knows, has been based for more than four decades on the primacy of EU law.Agreement by the European Council on the mandate for the IGC follows two years of uncertainty over the future treaty basis of the Union.  This could not have continued for much longer without inflicting damage on the Union's credibility.  In preparing the Council's work, the German Presidency wisely waited until after the spring European Council and the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome before increasing the pace of negotiations.  There were intensive contacts at all levels, including, as Members heard earlier today, when I travelled to Berlin to meet Chancellor Merkel a couple of weeks ahead of the Council.In the build-up to the Council, we acknowledged the reality that the constitution in its 2004 form was no longer acceptable to a number of member states.  We recognised the difficulties faced by some partners following the "no" votes in 2005.  Like others, we wanted to be helpful to those who had encountered ratification problems.  At the same time, we made it plain that we could not abandon the thrust of a draft treaty that was agreed in 2004 after long, complex and highly inclusive negotiations and which was needed to enable the enlarged Union to operate successfully in the interests of our citizens.  We fully achieved that objective last week.The mandate we agreed at the weekend is a good compromise between those who had difficulties in ratifying the constitutional treaty and those, like Ireland, who wanted to retain its substance.  Its altered appearance is a small price to pay for unanimous agreement on how the Union will carry forward its work for many years.For Ireland, the mandate represents the achievement of all our goals in the negotiations: the substance of the constitutional treaty is preserved, combating climate change will now be given a treaty basis, our position on justice and home affairs is maintained and we can determine the best course for Ireland in regard to the JHA opt-in option during the IGC.For the Union, the mandate reflects the main tenets of the constitutional treaty.  These include provision for a more efficient and effective enlarged Union, the introduction of a President of the European Council, the creation of more effective arrangements to manage the Union's increasingly important foreign policy, an enhanced role for national parliaments, ensuring that the composition of the Commission will be based on absolute equality between member states, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, setting out clearly the rights which must be respected in the implementation of the EU's business and ensuring that the social consequences are taken on board when assessing the likely impact of legislative proposals.Ireland has benefited hugely from EU membership and continues to do so.  As an advanced nation with an export-orientated economy we have a substantial stake in a stable and prosperous future for Europe and its neighbouring regions.  This can best be secured with an EU which maintains a high level playing field for economic activity within Europe and which can advance Europe's values internationally.  Ireland needs a Europe that works, whether that be dealing with international crime, addressing energy security, managing relations with Russia, negotiating with the World Trade Organisation, operating and regulating the Single Market or combating climate change.  An effective EU is a vital national interest.  The agreed mandate provides the basis for modernising our Union to take account of the way Europe's circumstances have changed in recent years.  For that reason alone, the reform treaty will be good for Europe and for Ireland.

One of the problems I perceive with any European matter is that the language used in statements is language about which the ordinary person in the street does not have a clue.  For example, the Taoiseach said the role of national parliaments has been considerably increased, with the so-called yellow card procedure much strengthened.  Can anybody tell me what somebody listening to this on radio would take from that?  We are using language here that people do not understand.  We talk about JHA and options during the IGC.  With respect, this is language that people do not understand and that is part of the difficulty.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	160	Three years ago, when Europe reached a historic agreement on the constitutional treaty, I recall Valéry Giscard d'Estaing saying to the negotiators: "This is what you need to do if you want people to build statues of you on horseback in the villages you all come from."  Despite all the hope and confidence that might have been achieved, in the end the agreement and the statues in the villages had to wait.  As a committed European and vice-president of the European People's Party, I am pleased and relieved by last week's moves to agreement and consensus which rescue us from the stagnation and divisiveness of the past two years.  The Fine Gael Party strongly supports EU reform.The period of reflection turned out to be more protracted and contentious than originally envisaged.   Last week's agreement may have come late and with some difficulty, but it must be said that to conclude the period of reflection in such a positive way was a distinct achievement for the German Presidency, as mentioned by the Taoiseach.  I agree, and I pay special and deserved tribute to Chancellor Angela Merkel.  Her task was difficult, some said impossible, but in the face of huge pressure and a hardening of attitudes of some member states she led the discussions forcefully and with admirable skill.This week the Financial Times compared the efforts to change the text to the description of Nabokov’s Pale Fire — “A labyrinth of dazzling complexity” and a prime example of “the literature of exhaustion”.  At 4 a.m. this must have been true for the 27 negotiators and their retinues.There is no doubt that membership of the European Union has been excellent for Ireland.  We have gained huge benefits economically and infrastructurally, but now we need to move on to discussion about Europe in a way that goes beyond the traditional sell of pure economic opportunity, beyond the one-way benefit of what is in it for me. This time we need a real and informed debate on the necessity for the Union and what it really means for us to be Europeans.  With another referendum on the way next year, I urge the Taoiseach to give the country the resources and facilities to have that debate in every county and every section of society.  There is no room for complacency about the proposal for approval of the revised treaty.This debate needs to be replicated across the Union.  I was intrigued by one of the observations by the international relations commentator, Gideon Rachman, this week, which relates to the comment made by Deputy Seán Barrett, that while the constitution was all about transparency, when Europeans saw what Europe was doing, they were often horrified and hence the "no" vote on the constitution in France and the Netherlands.  He wrote:It was as if the manufacturer of tinned meat had suddenly decided it would be a good idea to put a large notice on the front of the tin stating: ‘this product contains re-constituted cows' udders!' How surprising and hurtful that sales should fall as a result.In the context of language and the understanding of it, when we say we should understand what Europe is at and that Europeans should see what Europe is about, we should be able to explain the situation to people in a more relevant fashion.  Entertaining and all as Rachman's interpretation may be, one must question whether there is an element of truth in it.  In the new formula did we take away the vital transparency that was achieved in the constitutional treaty, reducing it instead to mere footnotes in tiny print?  I noted the Taoiseach's statement during Question Time that he did not agree with the changes made to the original text.  He said that he made no secret of the fact that he would prefer the original form.  I hope that the Government will offer full and absolute support for this in the upcoming referendum.  I hope too that the Green Party, which has voted against the European Union in all previous referenda, and argued against the European ideal whenever it had an opportunity, will see that its responsibility as part of the Government is to support Ireland's view that the European Union is good for this country which, by playing its part in the Union, can be a strong role model for other countries.  If the party must consult with its membership I hope that the Green Ministers, Deputies John Gormley and Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, will be able to convince it that this is good for the country because complacency and divisiveness are not the way of the future for Ireland in the European Union.I agree that the achievement was significant.  No benefits will accrue to a divided or paralysed Europe or one that is so stricken with internal views that it cannot agree on the big picture.  The member states depend on a Union that works together to bridge divisions through co-operation and an understanding of common goals and challenges.  We supported the text of the European constitution and will strongly support this revised document and campaign actively for it throughout the country whenever the date of the referendum is agreed.I note the Taoiseach's point about the Charter of Fundamental Rights with which he dealt this morning.  I accept his view that he supports this fully and the reason he gave for his analysis of the British protocol which came in late at night.As Prime Minister Blair leaves office today it is appropriate to say that while we have given him due credit for his persistent dedication to the issue of Northern Ireland, his attempt to put Britain at the heart of Europe did not feature in the end.  I note that Mr. Blair is to be appointed an envoy to the Middle East on behalf of the Quartet.The Basque separatist movement ETA, has called off its ceasefire.  This is a complex situation and there is serious concern in Spain that it could result in a resumption of indiscriminate bombings.  It appears that the Spanish Government is having difficulty in that regard.  The situation there is more akin to that in Northern Ireland than that in the Middle East.  Perhaps Mr. Blair, with the assistance and advice of the Taoiseach, could speak to the Spanish Government, if requested, about how this might be resolved.It appears that the Spanish Prime Minister had some negotiations or dealings with ETA.  This was a cause of considerable concern at the meeting of the European People's Party.  I was able to cite the experience of the Irish Government in handling a difficult and sensitive situation to save lives, build bridges and put together an economy.  I wish Prime Minister Blair well in his future career and also wish the incoming Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, every success in his endeavours.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The recent so-called period of reflection has allowed debate on European issues to slide considerably.  After a period of stagnation that ran on far too long, the latest moves towards agreement and consensus within the Union are welcome.Angela Merkel, in her role as President of the European Council, deserves much praise for this.  She was faced with a difficult task to reinvigorate and revitalise the agreement of a treaty that had presented the European Union with its greatest challenge in many years.  In the face of considerable pressure, and with some states adopting hard stances on various issues, she has led the discussions that have forged a new agreement.No one benefits from a European Union that is paralysed.  The member states of the European Union depend on a Union that works together.  The new agreement sets a course for that type of European Union once again, but the agreement hammered out last week is only a beginning of the journey towards this end.When presented to the people in referendum, the new European reform treaty will not be simply waved through.  Without a doubt, people are now happy to question what benefit there is for them in Ireland's continued membership of a Union that has changed dramatically since we first joined more than 30 years ago.  This is as it should be.  For too long, this Government has expected people to simply be in favour of the European Union without explaining to them the real need for Ireland's continued membership of this co-operative group of European countries.There is now even more need for the Government to avoid lecturing people about the benefits of Europe, as has happened in the past.  Instead, it should, as the leader of Fine Gael suggested, listen to their concerns at county, city and parish level.  There are concerns about the capacity of the Union to accommodate future enlargement, the impact enlargement has had on people's quality of life and job security and the drift of jobs from west to east.  The Forum for Europe and the Government have a responsibility to listen to and address people's concerns on those issues at grass roots level.  If they fail to do so, they will repeat the errors of the past.  I see the newly appointed Minister for Europe in the House and his presence gives some hope that things will be different on the next occasion.Fine Gael is very supportive of Ireland's membership of the Union, and is happy to debate this at any time and place.  We are also supportive of the reforms that are needed to ensure we continue to get the most from the Union, for the people of Ireland and the peoples of Europe.  This is one of the reasons we have pushed, most recently in our general election programme, for an end to the wasteful trek from Brussels to Strasbourg every month.  This squanders money, is damaging to the environment, and undermines the ability of the European Union to speak with authority on the very issues that it should be championing.However, for a party such as Fine Gael, which has a strong pro-European stance, the current Government composition must be of concern.  The Green Party will not be in a position to signal whether it supports the text until it consults its members.  If its members are opposed will we see a divided Government on the issue?  What chance is there for this treaty being passed if the Government itself cannot agree on the issue?With regard to the name of the treaty, Ireland is already a signatory to a number of different constitutions, that of the World Health Organisation, WHO, being an example.  There has never been a question that our signatory status to these constitutions would undermine Bunreacht na hÉireann.  That said, I am broadly supportive of the change in the name of the treaty, as this matter can now no longer be used to cloud the debate which will surround the agreement of the treaty.  The necessary reforms to underpin the effectiveness and efficiency of the European Union are of more importance that the name of the treaty.However, a serious issue, on which there is popular misunderstanding, is that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I hope the clarification given by the Taoiseach this morning that Ireland has not obtained a derogation will get through to the public.  Otherwise it undermines one of the great selling points of the treaty and will mean the Government faces a much harder job convincing the public to support it.While political debate has been centred around the treaty in recent years, the development of a Single Market is not getting the attention it deserves.  There needs to be a strong message from the major political parties to the effect that a more efficient and effective European Union is in everybody's interest and that being an active member of the EU has benefited Ireland greatly.  The Green Party has surprisingly remained uncommitted to the treaty, which is strange because the party had two weeks of talks with Fianna Fáil before forming a Government.  It would appear that the Green Party had no agreement to back this treaty which its members knew was imminent.  This will be an early pressure point for the Government and it will be interesting to see how it unfolds.  It may make for embarrassing ambiguity in the future for Ministers from the Green Party and for the Government.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	162	It may be unseemly to quote Bismarck in the context of a German Presidency of Europe, but he made one apposite comment when he remarked that laws are like sausages; it is better not to see them being made.  We have not yet seen the law that will eventually result from last weekend's summit but, having seen just part of the process of its manufacture, even its greatest fans could not disagree with the reality that the blueprint for a new reform treaty is not a particularly pretty document.The Labour Party supported the constitutional treaty and fully participated in the process that resulted in this single legal document.  We believe in an EU governed by the rule of law.  We remain convinced that, for a people to be able to claim ownership of such a complex political organisation like the EU, they must first understand it.  After the referendum on the Nice treaty, it was acknowledged that our citizens were not fully abreast of the purpose and future intentions of the European Union and there was an increasing disconnect between the EU institutions and who they were meant to be working for, namely, the people of Europe.  After 50 years of existence, the Union was at a crossroads.One of the fundamental points agreed at the Finnish Council was the need to make Europe simpler.  We all agreed that by providing clarity in our legal framework, we would begin to assuage people's concerns that the EU was a heaving Leviathan-like structure intent on gaining more and more control over national law.Rather than a single document that people can understand, we are now confronted with a body that is governed by four separate treaties, comprising more than 1,000 articles that have never been consolidated but are full of amendments, substitutions and deletions, together with a forest of protocols, directives and regulations and a range of different ways of decision-making.  The obvious advantages of setting out what the Union actually does through a list of competences are now buried in a legal text where the contents page needs an accompanying explanation guide.  That is not just a pity from an aesthetic point of view, it also has practical ramifications. Most parties and individuals in the Dáil are pro-European.  Most of us realise that means a Europe clearly relevant to its citizens and their concerns, which is a more open and accessible Europe.  However, the truth is that a generation of eminent people who gathered on our behalf in Brussels have continued with an approach, language and terminology that does not aid the citizen to directly deal with the treaties themselves.There are many benefits that still exist from the constitutional text.  It seems that it was still possible to retain a great deal of what was achieved through this process.  In terms of the institutional amendments, the additional powers conferred on the European Parliament, the new budgetary procedure and the new rotating presidency of the European Council will assist in a smoother running of the mechanisms within Brussels.  The establishment of the EU as a single legal entity will open a new chapter in the Union's jurisprudence which will hopefully be of advantage to the legal recognition of the Union's work.  While the new title for the EU Foreign Minister position is rather cumbersome, at least the powers and functions of the high representative have been retained, further bolstering the coherence of the Union in its key strategic role on the global political stage.In addition, I welcome the further role that national parliaments will be able to play in the work of the Union and while EU legislation may not be the most interesting legal documents that come before this House, it is important that we, as Members, continue to develop our capacity to scrutinise European legislation.  By doing so, subsidiarity will not merely be a principle annexed to these legal documents, but will be made an increasing reality, to the clear benefit of our country.One of the greatest benefits from the constitutional project that has been retained is the clear list of competencies that the member state has sovereignty over and those that have been handed over to the Union, through previous treaties, for collective responsibility.  This list, simply compiled, is a useful and essential tool to show to those cautious of the Union that the EU institutions have limits, which have been defined through agreement by all member states and which they cannot exceed.However, one of the greatest disappointments and causes for concern is that people will not be able to find these important clarifications within an ever-expanding legal text.  They are now buried within one of the two founding treaties, under the common provisions title.  That fact is evidence of the reality that democratic development and accountability have long been the poor relations of the European project.  We are all responsible for the fact that the European Union and its affairs remain remote and removed from its citizens.  That was one of the good reasons for embarking not just on another round of institutional reforms to cope with an enlarged Union, but on a constitutional treaty-making exercise.The constitutional treaty deserves our support as democrats.  It would have given us a written EU constitution in a single text between two covers that all citizens could strive to understand, owe allegiance to and so claim to own.What has now transpired is that that aspect of the process that made most sense has been ditched.  It is not just flags, Beethoven, etc., that went out the window.  The success of the last Irish Presidency was to hand over a draft text which, by comparison, was clear and lucid.  That draft also has been ditched.The draft constitution was admittedly long and detailed.  It could not be otherwise if it is to set out a legal framework for close co-operation between 27 countries which wish to remain sovereign while pooling that sovereignty in certain clearly-defined areas, but its overall structure was simple enough.  It set out the principles of the Union, prescribed limits for what it could do, detailed how its institutions were to work, laid down a charter of rights to govern Union legislation, and consolidated policies developed over 50 years.The irony is that the referenda in France and the Netherlands showed a wide communications gap between leaders and their electorates on European issues.  This was interpreted as a suspicion of Europe's political elite and their expansionist plans for an enhanced European agenda.  The solution was to strip the new treaty of its constitutional aspects, not just flags and anthems, but even the notion of a single basic text.  The citizens' need was a need to take stock, to seek to simplify, to consolidate and to establish rational basic structures and rules.That is why one of the most important treaty-making tasks was the one undertaken by the Irish Presidency.  It was the most basic but least exciting of tasks — the drawing up of a genuinely readable version of the existing constitution of Europe.  The popular failure to grasp the European architecture is not due to any intellectual deficiency on the part of the people of Europe, nor is it simply lack of interest, but the opportunity to make Europe more readable, accessible and therefore more understood has been missed.One particular issue that has come to light and attracted comment in the past couple of days, and which has been commented on during Question Time and subsequently by Deputy Kenny here today, relates to Ireland's position on the opt-out from the charter.  The simple fact is that the charter comes into legal effect when member states are applying EU law.  If we are members of this Union, then our Government should adhere to that law, just as we ask our citizens to do.  The Taoiseach told us just now, as he did during Question Time, that he is in complete agreement with the charter but wants to know the implications of the British protocol for member states if interpreted by the courts.  I do not understand how we will determine that before the court is seized of a tangible issue.  The charter is a simple set of clear principles — rights that the Labour Party strongly supports and considers necessary for the application of European law.   The public deserves to know where each party stands on an issue that removes an important aspect of the original treaty from the Irish people.  The Taoiseach seems to say that all he has done is enter a caveat that allows him to raise issues at the convention.The Labour Party continues to support the Charter of Fundamental Rights and believes it should be fully incorporated in the text of the new treaty.  The opt-out of its provisions by the Government will have implications for Irish workers and trade unions in respect of basic and fundamental rights of Irish citizens.A pretty document it may not be but it is the one that we have.  Much of the good work from the long consultative process that resulted in the draft constitution has been retained in the outcome of the recent European Council.  The changes made to this legal text will need to be presented to the people of Ireland, as declared by the Taoiseach.  A very simple question that will be asked by our voters is why we need it.  I thought we had learned a lesson from Nice but it seems we have taken the same approach to our next European referendum as we have for all the previous times, blindly ignoring the fact that Irish voters are increasingly asking why they should vote for another one of these treaties.For those who framed the agreement, and for those who support the European project, there is a necessity to make it clear how the new structures will help to address concrete issues.  We will find it extremely difficult to sell treaties to the electorate on the basis that they provide Europe's leaders with a less messy way of conducting their affairs.  Instead we need to demonstrate how a more effective Europe can contribute to economic growth, more and better jobs, action on climate change and a fairer world order.  I do not doubt that Europe's leaders faced a major challenge going into the weekend.  They have emerged with just as great a challenge, namely, persuading people to support the new treaty.It is a pity to see the fine balance found during our Presidency dissected into legal pieces and peppered throughout an already unpalatable legal text.  Selling this to our population, after it gets further additional commas, sub-clauses and numbering changes from the Intergovernmental Conference, IGC, will be a major challenge.

We knew an air of crisis would be created and the negotiations would drag on until the early hours of the morning.  We knew that a last-minute deal would be done, much to the practised relief of the EU leaders and assorted commentators.  We know that every EU leader would declare that they had been vindicated in their approach to the negotiations.  It all went according to plan.  We are being told that there is no alternative but to ratify this treaty, as we are always told.The first imperative of the summit was to show that Europe is moving forward so a deal was always going to be done.  The second imperative was for the French and Dutch Governments to be able to say that some of the most objectionable parts of the constitution have been removed.  The text was duly blurred in places where it came in for greatest criticism during the French and Dutch referendums.  The third imperative was for various European Union leaders to play to their national public, just as the Taoiseach has done in recent days.  Last but not least was the imperative to avoid referenda where possible.  For this to happen, everybody must pretend the constitution is not a constitution.According to the imperatives, the summit has been a great success, but the summit has not been a success for ordinary people across Europe.  The summit decided to rename the EU constitution a "reform treaty".  This is reminiscent of the name change of Windscale to Sellafield.  Objectionable terms have been changed to try pull the wool over people's eyes.  Some of the more obvious symbols of statehood have been removed or clouded over but let us make no mistake, the so-called reform treaty is the EU constitution in all but name.  As the Taoiseach stated earlier, the changes do not "undermine the balance and substance of the constitutional treaty".  The constitutional treaty has been taken off the shelf, dusted off, repackaged and put on special offer.  No referendum will be necessary in most states.The draft mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference, IGC, explicitly and continually refers to the conclusions of the IGC in 2004, or in other words, the failed EU constitution.  As the Taoiseach stated, "90% of the substantive package remains unaltered".  This is the same package that has already been rejected by the people of France and The Netherlands.  We were forced to vote a second time on the same package that was the Nice treaty, but the French and the Dutch who are being asked to swallow this pill will not be asked again whether they want the treaty.  They are being told they can like it or lump it.The EU summit failed spectacularly to deal with any of the real issues and concerns of people across Europe.  EU democracy is further weakened and smaller member states in particular are further marginalised.  We will get an EU president whether we want one or not.  We do not want one.  We will also get an EU foreign minister, albeit with a different title — a high representative of the Union for foreign affairs and security policy.  That is a mouthful.  In effect, this is a foreign minister in substance if not in name.  People will see through the clouding of the matter.The Oireachtas will lose its role to decide on a whole new range of policy areas.  This will add to the difficulties we already have in influencing EU policy in its current areas of competence.  Our neutrality will be further undermined as we slip closer towards a militarised European Union.  While welcome, the protocol on services of general interest does nothing to stop the headlong rush towards privatisation and liberalisation of services.  Member states are still limited in their economic choices and restricted in their ability to tackle poverty and social exclusion.  The treaty will do nothing to address issues of global inequality and poverty, nor to uphold international law.Moreover, we have not yet dealt with the issue of enlargement.  As the new voting arrangements will not kick in until 2014 or 2017, the voting arrangements for any new member state still remain to be resolved.  When the new voting arrangements kick in they will mark a further shift in power towards the bigger countries.  The people of Europe do not want the reheated leftovers of the EU constitution, they want a European Union that is more democratic, which prioritises people over profit and respects the sovereignty of nations, especially those with smaller populations.Unfortunately this is not what has been or is now on offer.  Instead, the EU elite has chosen to run away from the people.  The Government cannot run away, much as it might wish to do so, and the people will be given a date for a referendum.  People must examine the treaty fully and in detail and must debate its implications fully before the referendum takes place.  It will be an opportunity to expose this treaty as the cynical manoeuvre it is.Sinn Féin has demands that it wishes the Government to take on board.  Given the opportunity presented by the Intergovernmental Conference next month, perhaps it will address them and negotiate on behalf of the Irish people rather than on its own behalf.  The first relates to the provision of state aid and to subsidies and funding.  As my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, outlined, Sinn Féin believes that state aid provisions are overly restrictive.  Potentially, they make it impossible for member states to make use of redistributive tools, such as targeted state funding, to full effect to achieve objectives such as balanced regional development.  For instance, I refer to addressing infrastructural defects in border regions in cases in which an overwhelming democratic mandate for such measures exists.When responding to Deputy Ó Caoláin, the Taoiseach acknowledged that state aid provisions can cause conflict at times but stated that the Government must negotiate with the European Commission when such issues arise.  Does the Minister of State agree the best way to ensure the Government and all future Governments would win such negotiations when conflict arises would be to insert an opt-out or a right to one into the next treaty?  I call on the Government to pursue an opt-out on the right of state aid provisions to overcome this island's legacy of Partition and to build a vibrant all-Ireland economy that addresses all the aforementioned shortcomings.The second issue relates to the pillar on police and judicial co-operation.  Sinn Féin recognises the fundamental importance of international co-operation between law enforcement authorities in the interests of justice for victims and the prevention of crime.  However, as the right to privacy is also a fundamental human right, all measures that would suspend this right to privacy must be justified, proportionate and balanced by adequate safeguards.  In Sinn Féin's experience EU legally binding measures in the area of justice and home affairs have not achieved the correct balance.  This is particularly the case after the events of 11 September 2001.  Therefore I also call on the Government to negotiate an Irish opt-out on matters relating to police and judicial co-operation, just as the British have achieved for themselves.Were such fundamental matters to be removed from the sovereignty of this member state, in effect we would be living in a super state, and even my old nemesis, Mr. Michael McDowell, agreed with me on this point.  Britain and Ireland operate a different legal system from the rest of the EU and there is huge variance across member states in terms of human rights safeguards in operation at present.  It is essential that the Government should seek and achieve an opt-out from the police and judicial pillar.  If the constitutional treaty comes into being, an opt-out would allow future Governments the freedom to opt into progressive measures and opt out of regressive ones as mandated by the people.I refer to the issue of Ireland's neutrality.  How can the Government contend that the reform or constitutional treaty as proposed is in any way consistent with the position of this small State as a neutral independent state?  The Taoiseach's argument is nonsensical.  How can the introduction of an EU Foreign Minister or "High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy" represent the views of Ireland on the world stage while in the same breath representing the views of NATO members, nuclear powers or those countries that dived headlong into an illegal war on Iraq?  How can anyone represent both views?  The simple answer is that no one can do so.  This move should be seen in the context of statements from the European Commission calling for EU member states to lose their individual seats in the UN.Thus far, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is one good thing in an exceptionally bad treaty.  We should ensure it is implemented in full throughout the Union and within this State.While making statements on the EU Council, I have concentrated on the proposed reform treaty, but I want to raise another issue, namely, Palestine.  EU Foreign Ministers, including ours, have made a hames of their involvement in this issue.  Instead of concentrating on the source of the conflict, the occupier — the Israeli state — the EU has used its powers as a provider of funds to further beat the Palestinian people.  The EU's decision to freeze funding after the democratic and fair election of Hamas amplified the impoverishment, hardship and factionalism suffered by Palestinians under occupation and sent the wrong political message to Israel and the United States.  It has exacerbated the humanitarian problems tenfold, particularly in the Gaza Strip.  What we have seen in recent weeks has been the result of the EU and others withholding funding from the region.When will the EU start to apply real pressure on Israel to end its occupation?  Will the Minister of State agree to push for the suspension of preferential trade?  I hope he will be able to address some of my points in his reply.  I do not anticipate his agreement with me, as we have been on opposing sides regarding previous EU treaties.  There is concern among the public that we are being sold the pig in the poke again, namely, that we will be asked to ratify something that is unacceptable to the peoples of Europe.  In many cases, there will be no opportunity for a referendum.  It is detrimental to our nation, sovereignty and the interests of the Irish people as a whole.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	164	The Taoiseach stated: "The new system of double majority voting in co-decision matters, where 55% of the countries representing 65% of the citizens must approve a measure, will not now come into force until 2014 and if any member state so wishes, it can be further deferred until 2017."  What is the Government's attitude regarding this decision?  How will the system operate in practice and if any country in the Union decides to oppose the proposal, will it be delayed until 2017?On energy policy, demand outstripping supply and the consequent impact on prices, supply and competitiveness, was there any discussion at last week's EU Council meeting on the need for a coherent policy?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	165	The Deputy is reading correctly in that there were difficulties regarding voting.  I would like to say, without being in any way patronising, how impressed I was by Members' contributions.  I agree fundamentally with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Barrett in his unscripted contribution.  There is an absolute requirement that European treaties be simple, not because people may not understand them but because we owe it to them to make the Union's processes transparent.Although I always regarded its title as somewhat inflammatory, we have moved from a single, coherent constitutional treaty document to something less coherent, a point made so eloquently by Deputy Rabbitte in his fine contribution.  That is the negative side.  The positive aspect of the change is that the great bulk of the work of so many, as contained in the document, is protected.Deputy Ó Snodaigh is correct in his observation that the document was produced by 250 representatives of the peoples of Europe, comprising those elected to the various parliaments and governments as well as diverse interest groups.  It was an extraordinary and rigorous process.  I was privileged to be part of it, as were Members from all sides of the House, in making a significant contribution.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that it is a pity that the coherence that came from a single document is lost.  What is important, however, is that the substance of the document — the good and valuable aspects of it — is retained.I am sure all Members agree that one of the most uplifting elements of the agreement is the provision regarding the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  It is one of the finest aspects of the agreement and an issue to which every democrat will be willing to sign up.  It will not be included in the reformed treaty but will be contained in a separate document with which there will be a strong linkage.  I ask those Members who have not read the charter to take the time to do so.  It is so important because it speaks of the aspirations and wishes of the peoples of Europe for generations.  It speaks of human dignity, the right to life, the integrity of the person, the prohibition of slavery — it sounds odd that this should be a concern in this day and age but it is a fundamental aspect — the right to liberty and security, and so on.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I was taking up a point made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh; I regret if I took it up at length.  The charter is a fundamental aspect of this enterprise.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	174	We all know that.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I am glad that is the case.In regard to Deputy Allen's question on double majority voting, I made the point earlier in response to Deputy Barrett that it was no wonder people lost interest when we slipped into using this type of jingoistic terminology.  Yes, it is the case that the new system of double majority voting has been pushed back to 2014 and, as made clear in the statement, if any member state so wishes, it may be deferred until 2017.  Poland has difficulties with this provision.  Therefore, the answer to the Deputy's first question is yes.On the issue of energy, I draw Deputy Allen's attention to two specific references in the mandate, one relating to energy solidarity and the other to climate strategy.  I will provide the specific references if the Deputy so wishes.  I make the point, however, that this is where we lose the peoples of Europe.  Rather than talking about the issues, we are talking about chapters and paragraphs, thanks to the Deputy.  Included in chapter 4 is the statement:Without prejudice to any other procedures provided for in the Treaties, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may decide, in a spirit of solidarity with Member States, upon the measures appropriate to the economic situation, in particular if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products, notably in the area of energy.There is a specific reference to the matter.  Reference is also made to climate change later in the same section.  The answers to the Deputy's questions, therefore, are "yes" and "yes".

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	179	It will be ironic to attend the National Forum on Europe tomorrow, given that it was established subsequent to the difficulties experienced by Ireland regarding the Nice treaty.  Part of the forum's remit was to provide greater awareness, transparency and accountability by involving citizens.  That was Ireland's response to a difficult situation when we had a negative vote but the response we are now discussing is the opposite.  We have no transparency whatsoever and it seems the purpose of the procedure on which we have embarked is to enable member states to avoid referenda by making matters as confusing, complex and legalistic as possible.  It will be interesting to learn how the various Irish interest groups respond at tomorrow's forum.  It certainly seems we are moving backwards in that respect, which is a severe disappointment.Was any discussion held on whether the way is now open to proceed with enlargement and is there the stomach for proceeding, particularly with regard to the Balkans?We do not have a text of a treaty as such but we have a mandate for the IGC.  Has any other substantial issue from the constitutional treaty been included, apart from climate change?  I understand that component represents a major difference from the original treaty.Perhaps the Minister of State can provide the answer the Taoiseach did not give during Question Time by indicating whether the other two parties in Government were consulted in advance on acceptance or otherwise of the caveat to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	180	My apologies to Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  When I was interrupted, I forgot to answer the second part of his question.  The Middle East peace process was certainly discussed in the Council and the focus of the questions and answers and most of the contributions made today concerned the main issue.  The collapse of the unity Government and the Hamas takeover of Gaza was part of it and the reality is that it is a tragedy for the Palestinian people who have already suffered so much for so long.  I disagree with the Deputy's characterisation of the European Union and its role on that issue.  The EU is one of the biggest supporters in that area and has given substantial and welcome support to the people who have suffered.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	181	It has not performed very well since the election of Hamas.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	182	The EU has reacted promptly to the violence and division.  On 18 June, the General Affairs and External Relations Council issued a strong message in support of President Abbas which should be understood in the context of the discussions.  It has also restored normal relations with the new emergency Government and is seeking ways to restore direct aid, with which Deputy Ó Snodaigh was specifically concerned because such aid will have a significant impact on the people of the area.  My apologies for not responding to the Deputy.In response to Deputy Costello, the focus was primarily on the constitutional treaty and where we go from here.  The Deputy is right that climate change was a significant addition.  A better reference was made, which has not been given as much coverage as it deserved, to services of general economic interest, which the Deputy and myself would both welcome given our interest in public utilities.  Other than that, the main issue was to focus on the concerns that existed on the constitutional treaty.The Deputy also asked about accession and whether there was a focus on enlargement as such.  The discussion focused on the accession criteria.  There was much discussion, particularly laterally, on whether there should be a specific reference to the Copenhagen criteria.  The mandate does not deal specifically with the Copenhagen criteria but it does state that the conditions that were previously agreed by the European Council shall be taken into account.  There was a specific reason that a direct cross reference was not made to the Copenhagen criteria.  If there was to be such a direct cross reference, one would undoubtedly find, from time to time, judges deciding on the issue of extension of the Union, which is fundamentally a political decision which must be made.  It is a political decision which will be based on how Europe regards, for example, the human rights behaviour of an applicant.  However, to answer the Deputy's specific question, there is a reference to the accession criteria.Reference was made earlier to the area of national parliaments, which was a point I was going to make before I was interrupted.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Kenny that the issue of national parliaments is very important.  There is an extension in the number of weeks of delay which arises because of the yellow card process.  It is perhaps, in some people's view, not particularly large but it is there nonetheless.  Otherwise, the institutional arrangements are as they were.  One of the positive points about the weekend is that the institutional arrangements were not reopened because if they had been, the very fine balances which were put in during the course of the Irish Presidency could have been undermined.The process adopted by the German Presidency was to focus on as few points as possible.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's characterisation that much of the discussion for domestic consideration in other member states is on some people's abhorrence of referenda.  We will have a referendum here and that is a good and proper approach.  Indeed, it is the only approach possible under our Constitution.  It gives us the opportunity to engage with the people and do what Deputy Kenny referred to in his contribution.  Deputy Kenny made the point that it is very important for Europe to listen.  The only way we can listen is by having a dialogue, and we will have a dialogue.  I am very grateful to the leaders of the two main Opposition parties for their contributions.The final question the Deputy asked concerned whether, in the middle of the night, during the discussions on the British protocol, a reference was made back home.  The answer is "No" because clearly, at 3.45 a.m. it would not have been appropriate to do so.  However, the Taoiseach very wisely put down a marker that we must determine what exactly will be the impact of the British protocol.  My personal view——

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Deputy Costello is right.  I will be as brief as I can on the issue.  The British, for some reason which I do not understand, indicated from the beginning a certain allergy to the charter.  I could never understand that because, before I was interrupted, I was trying to make the point that the charter is a non-threatening part and——
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	188	The Minister of State was not interrupted.  He was called to order

Frankly, I was surprised that it caused so much difficulty.With regard to the protocol, if one examines the fields of application of the charter, which are in the original treaty and which will be transferred over by way of a new article, one can see that it achieves any clarification that anyone would reasonably require.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	190	Listening to the Taoiseach's contribution on the statements today one can see that he believes it is virtuous not to seek an opt out in any particular situation.  It is important to remind the Taoiseach and Deputy Roche, who now holds a new portfolio, that sovereign governments exercise the right to secure the right to opt out in the interests of sovereign people, which we are.  The Government should evaluate every situation in the interest of the people who have elected it.Let me cite the Taoiseach's references to police and criminal co-operation and what has been described as Britain's opt in clauses in relation to it.  The people have options.  From the Taoiseach's response to me during Taoiseach's questions, I formed a view that he was reading my points that it was an opt out blanket in all situations for State aid provisions, but that is not the case.  I am asking the Minister to take up in the course of the upcoming intergovernmental conference the opportunity to ensure that we have the right to exercise an opt out clause, where the specific provision is in conflict with the Government's stated intent to address the imbalance in terms of regional development.  As a Border Deputy, I am deeply concerned that we will not see the critical implementation of the promise to address the kinked economic and infrastructural investment that the Border and western counties have suffered from for many years.  It is critical the Government protects the interests of people in the regions throughout the island.  I understand the EU is well disposed to this.Under the North-South Ministeial Council it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that State aid is provided to allow the problems of the regions to be addressed and to give economic vibrancy to the regions that have been long neglected.  We have a real fear that if we do not ensure the opt out option is in place, that effort will be significantly curtailed, if not rendered impossible.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Ireland's neutrality is well recognised, as it is in previous protocols.  There is  nothing in the position of foreign minister/external relations high representative that will in any way undermine it.Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to opt out which touches on the point made by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  In general we do not like such clauses for the simple reason that it makes the process extraordinarily cumbersome.  It is far better to be part of the mainstream and to negotiate positions.  We have an opt in arrangement in regard to immigration, asylum and external borders.  That arises out of the reality that we have no option but to join the British.  That issue arose earlier under the Schengen Agreement and we must consider the implications for Ireland of the British arrangements in the criminal law area.  I do not believe that we should automatically subscribe to whatever arrangements the British come to.  I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin that we have to make a decision on where the balance lies in its own right.There was a great deal of discussion on the issue of competition. There is a fairly oblique reference to the protocol which deals with the Internal Market and competition which came in following President Sarcosi's intervention.  Apart from that brief reference there is nothing that changes the existing arrangements.  There was a specific reference to services of general economic interest, to which I also referred and which I welcome because it is something with which those of us who are concerned about social Europe might have had some difficulties.  It was addressed in a positive rather than a negative sense.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I congratulate Deputy Howlin on his election to the Office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I have no doubt he will be an outstanding Leas-Cheann Comhairle and that he may be tempted from time to time to intervene inappropriately, given that he is a man with strong opinions on many subjects, including health.There have been a number of important developments in regard to the new national paediatric hospital during recent months.  On 8 March last, I announced the appointment of Mr. Philip Lynch as chairman designate of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  I recently signed an order establishing the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on a statutory basis.  The development board held its inaugural meeting last Monday.The principal functions of the board will be to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new national paediatric hospital in accordance with a brief to be approved by the Health Service Executive.  The brief will set out the preferred model of care, the core services to be delivered at the new hospital and the additional range of services to be provided in an urgent ambulatory care setting, taking account of international best practice.The HSE is being advised in this context by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Limited, RKW, an established UK-based health care planning company.  In finalising its work RKW, together with a panel of international advisers, has arranged a series of meetings later this week with key stakeholders, including the three paediatric hospitals.The development board has begun the process of putting in place the necessary project support structure to progress the development.  I am aware that the position in regard to the provision of paediatric services in Tallaght Hospital has been a matter of concern for the hospital and the local community.  I was, therefore, pleased to confirm recently that a major ambulatory care centre in Tallaght will be advanced as part of the initial phase of the new paediatric hospital development.  This ambulatory care centre will offer a comprehensive and wide range of services to children, including an urgent care service, a major expansion in outpatient services and a significantly increased day surgery service.  This followed an analysis of the current location of major paediatric populations in the catchment area for the new hospital and the need to minimise the travel time for children requiring access to such services.The vast majority of current attendees at the existing children's accident and emergency department in Tallaght Hospital do not require admission and will continue to access their care at the ambulatory care centre.

She has confirmed to the House that RKW undertook, at the request of the HSE and her Department, to identify locations for the new centres?  Why then did the Minister announce on 16 May last the development of a new children's care centre in Tallaght which many of us representing the local area believe is an attempt to substitute for the closure of our local children's hospital?  Why did the Minister make that announcement before RKW had completed its work and was still involved in ongoing discussions with all the stakeholders?  Did the Minister consult or inform Professor Drumm and the HSE of her intention to make the announcement on 16 May?

I acquired the information from the HSE.  I believed it was important that it be put into the public domain as quickly as possible given the confusion caused by the misrepresentation of what was happening in this area.  It was always the case, as the Deputy will be aware, that in addition to a national children's hospital, there would be ambulatory care centres.  RKW believes that the major centre, which will be under the auspices of the children's hospital and will not be stand-alone or separate, should be located in Tallaght.  It may well be that two further centres will be located in the greater Dublin area.  However, that remains to be determined.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The Minister has confirmed to the House that she made an announcement prior to RKW's completion of its work in consultation with the stakeholders.  That is a fact.  The Minister has also confirmed that that information came from Professor Drumm which, I suspect, other stakeholders will be interested to learn.On the now established development board, which will seek to bring the tertiary hospital at the Mater all the way in terms of development, will the Minister confirm that two of the three hospitals cited in the statutory instrument which she signed into law two days before the general election, when the House could not discuss the matter, have refused to nominate a person to the development board?  As there is not unanimous agreement on the best location for the national children's hospital, is it not premature to advance?  If the Minister's model of paediatric care in Dublin city and county is put in place is she satisfied that no child will die because two of the three existing 24/7 accident and emergency wards in Crumlin and Tallaght will be no more?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I am satisfied the model of care being put in place will deliver higher quality care to very sick children from the whole country.  This is not only a hospital for Dublin.  It is a hospital for the entire country.  Between 40% and 45% of the patients will come from outside the Dublin area.  This is the model of care that operates in the best children's hospitals in the world, such as those in Toronto, Philadelphia, Chicago and one being put in place in Manchester.It is not true that the other hospitals have refused to nominate persons to the development board.  Tallaght hospital wished to send somebody to the meeting last Monday.  It said it had not chosen its representative on the board and asked if it could send a different person.  A view was taken by the chairman that it would be better to wait until its representative could sit on the board.On 8 March 2007, I made it clear that we would establish the development board.  Mr. Philip Lynch was announced as chairman designate.  He and I consulted the three hospitals affected regarding the appointments to the board.  I made it clear that as soon as that consultation process was completed and the legal instrument was in place I would sign it.  There was no question of that not happening.  Nothing secret was done.  The process began on 8 March.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Why does the Minister believe it appropriate to sign a statutory instrument two days before a general election when the House did not have an opportunity to debate or annul the order?  Why did the Minister feel she had the right to make that decision two days before a general election?  She also made the decision regarding Tallaght hospital one week before a general election when her own seat was at risk.  That is not the way to do business.  One does not employ a group of people to do a piece of work and gazump them while they are doing it.

They should be in the primary centre.If the Government believes, with the support of the Health Service Executive, that we should have a single paediatric hospital for very sick children it is appropriate that we go ahead with that.  Among the people urging me to proceed was the chairman designate, who was keen to get on with the job.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	214	The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that the number of patients receiving dialysis treatment at the Limerick Regional Hospital has increased by approximately 20% in the last two years.  I understand the dialysis service in Limerick now runs on a seven days a week basis, working at maximum capacity, providing 277 treatments for 99 patients a week.  Five patients from the mid-west area are currently receiving their treatment at neighbouring units as an interim measure until dialysis capacity is increased locally.  Arrangements are well advanced to provide for increased dialysis capacity in Limerick in the short and medium term.  The HSE has invited tenders for the provision of additional dialysis services and is also working with the Irish Kidney Association in an effort to increase capacity locally.Additional revenue funding of €12 million was provided for the HSE in 2006 and the current year to support the provision of dialysis facilities, the development of a living-related renal donor programme and the implementation of the national renal strategy which is due to be published shortly by the HSE.  I understand it will recommend the development of additional consultant-led renal services on a regional basis.A number of new renal dialysis facilities have opened recently and others are due to open soon.  These include: a nine station facility opened in St. Vincent's Hospital in 2006; eight new dialysis stations at Cork University Hospital which are due to open later this summer; and a 17 station unit is being opened as part of the new hospital development at Tullamore which will open at the end of this month.  In addition, 155 patients are being treated in dialysis units operated by the private sector, while 15 living donor transplants will take place this year in Beaumont Hospital.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Will the Minister comment on the statement by the Irish Kidney Association which she quoted that the situation in the dialysis unit at the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick is appalling?  The IKA has blamed the Health Service Executive for the situation that has developed there.  Does she agree that the overcrowding in Limerick has been reported and well documented during the years?  This inevitable situation which has been highlighted many times to the HSE arose because of a lack of foresight by the HSE.  The Minister informed us that she had invited tenders, but does she agree that tendering for dialysis services from the commercial sector — I presume she was referring to that sector — could take up to 18 months to implement?  Will she comment on a proposal that the mobile dialysis service in Tullamore should be moved to Limerick when a new hospital dialysis centre is commissioned there in July?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	218	People frequently talk in terms of crisis and things being desperate in the public health care system.  Recently, the chief executive of the Bank of Ireland said some commentaries on the economy might send us into a recession.  We need to be careful about the comments we make.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	219	It was the Irish Kidney Association.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	220	The fact is that 20% more people are availing of dialysis services at Limerick Regional Hospital than was the case two years ago.  There are five patients from the region who cannot be facilitated there, which is why the HSE has gone to tender.  The Tullamore unit is still in operation because the move to the new hospital does not take place until later this month.  I hope the HSE will be in a position to move the facility to Limerick or wherever it can be put to best use.  Since the Irish Kidney Association recommended Limerick, I have no reason to believe that is not the appropriate place for it.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The national renal strategy report was completed in December but has not been published.  Why has there been a delay in publishing this important report on renal treatment?  Does the Minister agree it is unacceptable that patients must travel from the mid-west area for such treatment?  Is it fair to expect them to receive dialysis treatment at night time?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	222	It is appropriate to receive dialysis treatment during the working day.  Dialysis treatment should be provided as close as possible to where people live.  It is not just a once-off treatment because, as we know, people must attend a minimum of three times a week for a long period.  Therefore, the treatment should be available as close as possible to where people live.  That is what we are trying to do.  In the beginning the dialysis service was only available in major population centres.I understand publication of the strategic review by the HSE is imminent.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	223	The final outturn on Vote expenditure for the Health Service Executive in 2006 shows a capital saving of €114 million, of which €42 million was used to offset a revenue overspend, while a further €47 million was used to offset a shortfall in appropriations-in-aid.  This left a balance of €25 million to be surrendered to the Exchequer.  The Health Service Executive's appropriation account for 2006 will show an overall surrender of €365 million — €25 million capital and €340 million in respect of the long stay repayment scheme.In 2005 there was an overall surrender of €79 million.  The capital programme had a saving of €50 million, non-capital programmes saved €4 million and appropriations-in-aid showed a surplus of €25 million.  With regard to expenditure to date in 2007, the latest figures available from the Health Service Executive report total expenditure to the end of May as being approximately €4.8 billion against projected expenditure of €4.77 billion.  Within these figures the trend in expenditure is much the same as in 2006.  The capital spend is behind that planned, while the non-capital is running ahead of budgeted spend.  I have discussed corrective action with the CEO as a matter of urgency.The capital programmes submitted by the HSE in each of the three years, and approved by me, included sufficient projects to absorb its capital allocation for each year.  However, actual capital expenditure in 2005 and 2006 turned out to be less than had been planned.The HSE has taken steps to strengthen its capital management capacity, including the establishment of a single national estates function and the appointment of a new director.  The level of capital funding provided to the HSE for 2007 will support a continuing high level of investment in our public health services and will enable the completion and commissioning of many new acute and community health care facilities.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	227	Does the Minister not feel she should hang her head in shame?  The news is worse than what was published in the papers.  In 2006, €114 million of the capital fund was unspent and that is truly shocking.  We have just heard about dialysis patients in Limerick who are unable to access dialysis at a reasonable time of day and there are similar needs across the country.  Does the Minister accept responsibility for this?  Against the best advice of her Secretary General and officials she decided that the HSE would be the Accounting Officer when it was established.Year after year there has been underspending and a failure to deliver, even though the capital fund is anything but generous.  Will the Minister for Health and Children accept responsibility for this?  Rather than suggest the HSE will set up yet another Department with yet another highly paid director, which seems to be regarded as the solution to everything, will the Minister indicate to us how the funding will be spent for purposes we in this House determined it should be spent?  There should be close evaluation because even the Comptroller and Auditor General was unable to assess accurately how money was diverted towards information technology projects within the HSE, with an overspend in that regard.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	228	One thing is certain, the Deputy has changed neither her tune nor her language.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Unfortunately, the story is still the same.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I strongly stand by the decision to make the CEO of the HSE the Accounting Officer.  I know of no good management system where a person is responsible for the delivery of services but is not accountable for the money involved.  I do not believe that could lead to good management practice.  I believe it is appropriate that the HSE should use expertise from outside the health service to run its estates function, as it recently did.  The person appointed, Mr. Brian Gilroy, comes with a great deal of experience of projects in other sectors and I believe there will be a huge transformation in the manner in which this new national organisation sets about putting in place its capital programme.Under the old health board regime the approach was to spend money no matter what.  Money is allocated for particular projects and it is the duty of the HSE to ensure it is spent on those projects rather than spent merely for the sake of spending it.  I strongly support this policy and I believe, though there will always be capital requirements, Ireland, together with Norway, at 5% has the highest percentage of capital spending on health of any country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  I believe this is an appropriate level of investment.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The health budget in Ireland is different to other countries because there is a large element of social funding.  It seems the Minister has not changed her tune either.  She is relying again on private consultants to the tune of €100 million in terms of what will be done in the health service.While we all understand that not all projects proceed on time, does the Minister accept that checks and balances are in place in Government Departments to ensure that money not spent on one project in a given year would be diverted to other vital projects to prevent it from being returned to the Department of Finance at the end of the year?  That is the way in which Departments work.  However, the Minister's wilful decision has left us in a mess and the HSE's solution, yet again, has been to establish another department and increase bureaucracy.  Meanwhile, patients are desperate for care, hospitals are desperate for extra beds and primary care centres are not being delivered.  All these physical facilities and services are being denied to patients due to the Minister's incompetence.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	232	It would be arrogant for me to comment on my competence or otherwise.  That is a matter for others to decide.  It is important that money allocated by the Exchequer, through the Oireachtas, is spent on the projects for which it is identified.  Allocated funds are switched to other projects.  For example, money was reallocated to minor capital works last year.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Yes, it went back to the Department of Finance.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	234	These moneys belong to taxpayers.  It is right that if taxpayers, through their elected representatives in this House, identify projects on which money is to be spent, this money should be protected for those projects in future years in the event that it cannot be spent in the year in which it is allocated.  Funding was switched to other projects, for example, to certain capital works, particularly in the care of the elderly, which were completed last year.  I am confident the new expertise acquired by the HSE will make a major impact on ensuring capital projects are completed on time and within budget.  Mr. Gilroy has been appointed full-time on a five-year contract and will not act as a consultant.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I am entirely satisfied that the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive fully supports the Government's health reform programme and I have full confidence that the Health Service Executive is implementing Government health policy.I assume the Deputy's question was prompted by comments made by the CEO in the course of his address at a major health conference in Dublin on 12 June last.  In his address Professor Drumm pointed out that, among the major areas where change is required in our health system, are the building up of primary and community services and reforming the acute hospital system.  The points made by the chief executive officer are fully consistent with Government policy.The programme for Government includes commitments to extend the GP out-of-hours service nationwide to ensure patients can be seen within one hour of their call.  This will give access to on-duty GP care 24 hours a day.  GPs will be fully equipped to ensure their expertise and skills minimise the need for their patients to attend an accident and emergency unit.  It also includes commitments to improve GP cover by developing primary health centres in socially deprived areas; work with GPs to ensure constantly improving out-of-hours cover for patients; ensure there is a primary care team serving every community, with particular reference to new and rapidly growing areas — 500 such teams will be funded by 2011; introduce improved supports for GPs who work in remote and disadvantaged communities, both for those starting out and those already established; and continue to implement measures to ensure the availability of real alternatives to hospital for those who require lengthy convalescence.As far as acute hospitals are concerned, the programme for Government commits to the provision of an additional 1,500 dedicated public only beds.  In addition, the HSE is reviewing the acute hospital bed needs up to 2020.  This review will identify the number of acute beds required and the capital and revenue implications and advise on how to meet the identified need.  The findings and recommendations of this review will inform the Government's policy on developing capacity in acute hospitals into the future.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	236	The Minister has informed the House that she is entirely satisfied with the position taken by Professor Drumm and the Health Service Executive, yet in his recent comments on the number of acute beds in the health care system Professor Drumm could not be clearer.  He stated that providing more acute beds would not improve the health service or deliver greater efficiency.  This position is entirely different from that of the Minister.  What is the true position?Recently, Professor Drumm also stated: "I see co-location as being a competitor for the HSE."  Does the Minister agree or disagree with that comment?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I totally agree with Professor Drumm regarding beds.  If we had 10,000 more beds in the morning, they would not significantly improve access and patient care if they were not appropriately used.  For example, the recent survey showed 13% of admissions are inappropriate and that people should not be in hospital.  On the day the consultants reviewed all of the hospitals, 39% of patients should not have been in the acute hospitals.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Yet the Minister is planning 1,500 extra beds.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	239	We are planning to use the beds we have efficiently and effectively and to have quicker access times for patients.  The point made by Professor Drumm — I have made it many times, both here and at the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children — is that if we do not use the existing stock of beds more efficiently and effectively, no matter what the number of beds is, if we do not get access to diagnostics from GPs so patients do not have to be admitted to hospital to have diagnostic checks carried out, and if we do not manage chronic illness at GP level in the community, people will end up accessing hospital beds.The decision of the HSE board to pursue co-location was made on the recommendation of Professor Drumm.  Competition exists between public hospitals at present.  The Deputy is a member of the board of the children's hospital in Tallaght so he does not need me to tell him how competitive it is vis-à-vis the other children’s hospitals.  In fact, this is one of the reasons there is such controversy attached to creating a single hospital.  Competition is no bad thing between service providers, whether they are in the public sector, private sector or a mixture of both.

I would like a "yes" or "no" answer.  Professor Drumm stated: "I see co-location as being a competitor for the HSE".
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	241	That is true.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	242	Is that the Minister's position?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	243	Yes, it is.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	244	That is the exact opposite of what she told the House yesterday, when she spoke about a unified system on the grounds of public hospitals between public and private hospitals.  We have now got an admission from the Minister that she sees this competition by the new co-located hospitals against our public hospitals as in order.  That is fundamentally different to what she told the House yesterday and to her stated position.  Has the Minister full confidence in Professor Drumm, given that he is clearly opposed to her ideology-driven model of providing additional private beds on public lands?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The Deputy is wrong.  I told him the HSE board signed off on co-location on the recommendation of the CEO and the management——
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	246	It was a Government decision.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	247	No.  The HSE board signed off on these projects for the individual hospitals on that recommendation.  Professor Drumm put in place a process of thorough audit within the HSE in regard to each individual site to make sure——
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	248	But that——

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The Minister will not answer.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	251	It was put in place to make sure that what was happening at each site complemented what was needed in the public hospital.  There will be an element of competition.  Tallaght Hospital competes with St. James's Hospital.  Has the Deputy ever got into discussions with those hospitals?  Consultants compete with each other even within hospitals.  This is the nature of how services are provided.  People compete for resources, capital investment, more consultants, more staff and more services both within and between hospitals.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	252	Can I ask a brief supplementary question?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	253	If you do so, we will lose the final question, which is your question.  I call Question No. 67.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	254	The HSE recently published the emergency department task force report.  The infrastructural deficits identified in the seven hospitals referred to are being addressed through a combination of interim and long-term capital improvements and refurbishment.The task force recommends that the issues in emergency departments be examined on a whole-hospital and whole-system basis.  It identifies the requirement for hospital-specific initiatives as well as the development of national responses in regard to key structural issues.  A key requirement is the development of strong internal management control processes at hospital and community levels to ensure capacity is fully optimised and that measures designed to unlock capacity are supported by strong controls that enable appropriate balancing between emergency and elective workloads.My Department is assured by the HSE that a series of additional measures are being put in place to ensure the delivery of an improved service for patients and to reduce pressure on accident and emergency departments.  These include a series of hospital avoidance measures including the following: the expansion of the hospital in the home scheme to the Dublin academic teaching hospitals; the development of community intervention teams; the roll-out of more primary care teams; the expansion of out-of-hours GP services and the expansion of community diagnostic services.  Measures being taken to improve and optimise acute hospital capacity and capability include the following: seven new community nursing units in Dublin, additional long-stay beds outside Dublin, development of admission lounges, acute medical assessment units at Navan and Naas, acute medical admission units at Beaumont, Sligo and Tallaght and the development of enhanced diagnostic capability in hospitals.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Will the Minister confirm that this damaging report, which showed that seven accident and emergency wards were unfit for purpose, was effectively suppressed until after the general election?  The report was published on 1 June but was expected at the end of last year.  Why was this bad news left until after the general election?Returning to a point made by Deputy Liz McManus, who will take responsibility for the guarantee given that by February 2007, six hours would be the longest waiting period for patients in accident and emergency wards?  This is another deadline missed.  Who takes responsibility for that in the brave new world that is the HSE?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	256	In the previous question the Deputy asked me if I had confidence in Professor Drumm.  I have 100% confidence in him and think we are very lucky to have someone with his vision, determination and courage at the head of our health services.  Given his clinical background, he brings enormous credibility to the HSE.On the matter of publication of the task force report, I had no hand, act or part in its publication.  I am unsure whether it was published or whether it came into the public domain by way of response to a freedom of information request.  However, it is no secret to any active citizen that deficiencies exist in many of our accident and emergency departments.  That fact is of no surprise to anybody.  The challenge now is to put in place infrastructural improvements, some of which I mentioned.  For example, significant investment is about to take place in Drogheda and we have already made significant investment in Wexford.  Since the compilation of the report, many of the matters referred to in it have been dealt with.The matter of the time, from arrival in accident and emergency units to admittance or going home, is one on which we need to concentrate.  We should not just concentrate on the time spent on a trolley from the time a decision has been made to admit a patient.  Often, the experience is that from the time people arrive, it is a couple of hours before any clinical expertise is available to them.  That is the issue.  I hope that in future the HSE will be in a position to put in place short time lines throughout the country.Some 95% of the 3,000 people who visit accident and emergency units every day have a relatively pleasant experience.  Research has shown that the issue concerns the remaining 5% in a few key hospitals.  The HSE is working with those hospitals to improve performance.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Will the Minister accept that the key problems within the accident and emergency departments referred to in the report are the lack of beds and the need for additional capacity?  Given that we have missed the stated, firm deadline that by February 2007 no one would be left waiting for more than six hours, what is the latest commitment?  Will it be October, November or February 2008?  I have only been spokesperson on health for a matter of weeks, but it appears we have a shifting deck of responsibility with regard to certain people taking responsibility for actions that are unmet.  The Minister is very keen to inform the House of the responsibility of the private sector when it comes to deadlines and commitments, but when it relates to the HSE and matters falling under her Department, she is less responsible.  When will this commitment be met?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	258	As the Deputy is aware, the HSE acquired the assistance of outside expertise to visit a number of hospitals, look at their processes and make recommendations.  Many of those recommendations related to improved procedures and processes within the hospitals and had nothing to do with extra capacity.  For example, the HSE has acquired diagnostic capacity at Smithfield in Dublin for approximately 2,000 older patients who suffer from chronic illnesses who are directly referred there.  The HSE required capacity for the waiting list in the Mater for an MRI and that was cleared in a matter of weeks by a private provider.Direct access by GPs to diagnostic facilities will greatly improve performance in accident and emergency units, as will the provision of the out-of-hours service, particularly in the north of Dublin and in other parts of the country where many people end up in accident and emergency units who do not need to be there.  These improvements will work together like a jigsaw — one does not work without the other.  Simply providing more capacity without changing the way we do the business and what we do at acute hospitals will not lead to the improvements to which we all aspire.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I recently signed an order establishing the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on a statutory basis.  The development board held its inaugural meeting last Monday.The principal functions of the board will be to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new National Paediatric Hospital in accordance with a brief to be approved by the Health Service Executive.  The brief will set out the preferred model of care, the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and the additional range of services to be provided in an urgent and ambulatory care setting, taking account of international best practice.The HSE is being advised in this context by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Ltd., RKW, an established UK-based health care planning company.  In finalising its work RKW, together with a panel of international advisers, has arranged a series of meetings later this week with key stakeholders, including the three paediatric hospitals.I am aware that the position on the provision of paediatric services at Tallaght has been a matter of concern for the hospital and the local community.  I was therefore pleased to confirm recently, that a major ambulatory care centre at Tallaght will be advanced as part of the initial phase of the new paediatric hospital's development.  The ambulatory care centre at Tallaght will offer a comprehensive and wide range of services to children, including an urgent care service, a major expansion in outpatient services and a significantly increased day surgery service.This followed an analysis of the current location of major paediatric populations in the catchment area for the new hospital and the need to minimise the travel time for children requiring access to such services.  Most attendees at the existing children's accident and emergency unit at Tallaght do not require admission and will continue to access their care at the ambulatory care centre.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I congratulate Deputy Brendan Howlin on his new position.Will the Minister tell the House what paediatric services currently provided in Tallaght Hospital will be removed from the hospital?  Is she aware that the widespread concern across the community about her plans to close down Tallaght as a paediatric hospital derives from serious concerns about the inaccessibility of the Mater site, and this Government's breach of faith with the original board of Harcourt Street Children's Hospital, to whom it said that a paediatric hospital would be maintained indefinitely in Tallaght?  Will she indicate the time frame for transferring paediatric services from Tallaght to the projected new hospital on the Mater site?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The board's remit is to put the new hospital in place to have it operational in 2012.  I was happy to hear from the chairman and the board members, whom I met on Monday, that they believe that ambitious deadline can be met.  Among the functions of the board is to work on the transfer from the three existing hospitals.  No tertiary facilities exist at Tallaght.  Those that were there moved to Crumlin Hospital some time ago.  I understand that between 80% and 85% of the patients treated in Tallaght will continue to be treated there.  The facility will operate from 8 a.m. to midnight.  There will also be an ambulance service to transfer patients who need to be transferred to the tertiary facility at the Mater.  The volume of activity in Tallaght will increase substantially depending on whether there are one or two additional centres on the south side and maybe the west of Dublin but that has not been determined yet.  I am happy to furnish the Deputy with a copy of the list of the activities envisaged in the ambulatory care centre in Tallaght Hospital.

I am sorry to say I cannot give the same welcome to the Minister with the health portfolio because her approach to health care and the needs of our people do not meet at all.Does the Minister accept that the board of Tallaght Hospital maintains that the loss of its paediatric services would be in breach of the charter which established the hospital and which was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Does she also accept that it would clearly be in breach of a personal promise, made by the Taoiseach in 2006, to the leaders of the various Protestant denominations who are represented on the board?  Does the Minister further agree that, given the growth in population in south Dublin and Leinster, served by Tallaght Hospital, the loss of paediatric services would present an unacceptable danger whereby the safety, wellbeing and perhaps even the lives of young children would be put at risk?Finally, does the Minister agree it was a disgrace for the HSE effectively to threaten the board of Tallaght Hospital that if it did not accept a co-location private hospital on its site it would not receive funding for the additional public hospital beds it required?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I am well aware of the Deputy's views on myself as they were well publicised in the aftermath of the election.  I am, however, delighted to see him back in good health and I say so genuinely.As I understand, the board of the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght and certainly the paediatricians in the hospital generally support the move to a single tertiary hospital for sick children.  I have not met all the paediatricians but have met many from all over the country and I have yet to meet one who does not support what we are doing, which represents best practice internationally to get the best possible state-of-the-art hospital for very sick children.  Most clinicians in the area, whether nurses or doctors, would strongly favour that.I am not an expert on the charter but do not believe any charter would put patients' safety second to anything else.  For those with serious organ failure and serious illnesses there can only be one tertiary level centre with the expertise required in a country such as ours, with a population of 4.3 million, or even on the island of Ireland.  That centre must be co-located with the national hospital because even with sick children we will not have sufficient numbers in the different specialties for sub-specialists to be able to deal only with children. I do not accept that the decision that has been made in any way undermines Tallaght Hospital.Finally, the HSE did not bully, harass or threaten Tallaght Hospital.  It told Tallaght Hospital to make up its mind and asked if it wanted to proceed with co-location or not.  That was not unreasonable and I am pleased to say the board unanimously agreed to go ahead.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	264	With a gun to their heads.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I am surprised the Minister has made this decision without reading the Tallaght Hospital charter.  I suggest she does so because what is now proposed is contrary to the charter and amounts to a serious breach of faith on the part of the State towards those involved in Tallaght, and particularly those involved in the move of the National Children's Hospital from Harcourt Street to Tallaght.Will the Minister acknowledge that, while paediatricians rightly favour the provision of one tertiary centre of excellence, they have major reservations about the Mater Hospital site?  It is untrue to suggest they support it.  Does the Minister acknowledge the proposed ambulatory centre will have no accident and emergency facility, no inpatient beds and will not be open after midnight?  Does the Minister accept that, given the current needs of the population catchment currently served by the paediatric section in Tallaght Hospital, there will be a grossly inadequate service?  Can she also confirm to the House the point she appeared to make in her response that, while 80% of the procedures currently provided by the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght will continue, 20% will not continue?  Am I wrong or is she unable to identify that 20% to the House?  Can she clarify the 20% of services currently provided which will be discontinued in Tallaght Hospital?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	266	We are well over time on this question but a number of Deputies wish to come in so I will ask the Minister to be as brief as she can and I will allow two more brief supplementaries.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I fully accept that not everybody is in favour of the Mater Hospital site.  If the impression was created that everybody was happy then it was wrong.  Of course they are not, but I do not believe that there is any site in the country to be co-located with an adult hospital that would have met all the requirements.I said that 84% of the children that attend the accident and emergency department in Tallaght Hospital do not get admitted.  The children's hospital in Tallaght has a 40% bed occupancy, so 84% of children who present there are dealt with and go home.  We believe this will continue to be the case in an 8 a.m to midnight facility.  There will be ambulance facilities in the hospital and very few children get transported to hospital between midnight and 8 a.m.  Having a single facility in the city that will take children between those times is not unreasonable.  Given the level of care that will be provided there, it will be much more reassuring for the parents of sick children, many of whom I have met.  The message they have given me, whether they are parents of children in Tallaght, Crumlin or Temple Street, is to get on with it and give them the hospital they deserve.The Deputy is right to say there will not be inpatient beds, as it will consist of day procedures and activity in the accident and emergency departments.  I am not in a position to say what is appropriate in 2012 on a day basis and what requires inpatient facilities.  That will be a matter for clinical decisions and not for me.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I thank the Minister for clarifying her statement because she accepts that there is deep anxiety among many paediatricians who have given their working lives to the care of children and have expressed very strong concerns about her policy on this hospital.  Does she accept we do not live in an ideal city?  Transport congestion is a serious block to children accessing care.  Rather than seeing it as a question of one site, a hospital could be provided on two sites north and south of the Liffey.  She has completely dismissed that option.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	269	When does the Minister envisage the publication of the RKW report?  If the report comes to the conclusion that the existing site is not sufficient for the kind of development of a world class tertiary hospital in Ireland, will she reconsider it?Where did the Minister get the information that there is a 40% bed occupancy for the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght?  I can tell her that it is wrong.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I got it from my Department and from the HSE.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Maybe she should ask them again.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	272	If the Deputy gives me the correct figures, I will be happy.  I have quoted that for the last year and it is yet to be contradicted.  It may have increased in the last few weeks, but I am referring to the period 2003-06.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	273	She should speak to some of the paediatricians.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I have spoken to many of them and I think the Deputy is aware of that.  We are following the advice of what happens in the best children's hospitals in the world.  Most of those hospitals are downtown in the centre of the city, co-located with research facilities, adult teaching hospitals and so on.  When the consultants were appointed to look at 17 different children's hospitals, they came to a strong recommendation that this was the way forward for our population base.  I do not think a good model of care is provided if experts have to travel from one site to another.  It is better that all the expertise is together.The development board must develop a hospital.  It must appoint a CEO and take the design that will be given to it by the HSE.  None of that will happen until we get the RKW report.  After the consultation this week with the stakeholders, my understanding is that RKW intends finalising the report in a matter of weeks.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I apologise.  I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 162 and 169 together.Improving the delivery of accident and emergency services is the Government's top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission and the turn-around time for those who can be treated in accident and emergency departments and who do not require admission.In March 2006, the HSE established a dedicated task force to facilitate the implementation of the HSE's framework for addressing the problems arising in the delivery of emergency department services.  The report of the task force was published on 1 June.The task force report noted that the majority of the hospitals which were identified as experiencing difficulties in the delivery of emergency department services have for some time been meeting the initial performance targets set by the HSE.  There are a small number of hospitals that have experienced particular difficulties in seeking to achieve the targets.The task force report recommends that revised targets should be set to ensure that no patient waits longer than 12 hours for admission to an acute bed, once the decision to admit has been made.  The ultimate objective is a total wait time target of six hours from the time a patient presents at the emergency department to the time he or she is either admitted to an acute bed or is treated and discharged home.  The task force acknowledged that further work is required on the establishment of total wait time targets.  Key issues to be addressed by the HSE in this context are the standardisation of processes and models of care within emergency departments and the standardisation of waiting time measurement.The HSE has announced that it intends to introduce revised performance targets in October next.  The basis for the timing of the introduction of the revised targets is to take account of key infrastructural developments, including the commissioning of 700 additional public long-stay beds.  In addition, a number of emergency department developments, including admission lounges and acute medical units, are to become operational in 2007 and at the start of 2008.  These developments are designed to deliver improvements in terms of the clinical decision-making within emergency departments and to address dignity and privacy issues for patients awaiting admission to an acute bed.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The Minister will recall setting up this task force in March 2006, when she heralded its inauguration in the context of there being a national emergency in the accident and emergency sector.  Where stands that statement now?  Does the Minister still accept that is a national emergency or is she prepared to row back on that in the context of publication of the report?In the context of an earlier question to which she delivered a reply to Deputy Brian Hayes, when the Minister stated that this report forms part and parcel of a jigsaw, I put it to her that the most important aspect of anybody engaging in putting together a jigsaw is the matter of setting targets, that one will never finish a jigsaw unless one sets a completion hour in which to put it together.  Does she accept that is the fundamental flaw in this report?  As well as the report casting a poor reflection on the accident and emergency facilities and performance in seven of the country's major hospitals, it does not identify the targets.  It is merely a catalogue of failure and a cosmetic exercise.  When one considers the substance of this report, one sees failure after failure.Having been out of the House for the past few years I have noticed a total remove by the Minister from the health services, illustrated in her semi-detached reply.  The Minister receives the report in a semi-detached manner.  I regret that the Minister does not appear to have any role in this.  If she has a view on setting targets perhaps she could inform the House of the nature of her involvement.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I welcome the Deputy back to the House.  In March 2006, when the number of patients on trolleys awaiting treatment for a number of hours hit 500, I stated that it must be treated by the HSE as if it were a national emergency.  In other words, we had to apply a focus as if we had a national emergency.  That was the appropriate way to treat the difficulties that had arisen.  Everyone, including the Irish Nurses Organisation, the IMO and others, has acknowledged that we have seen major improvements, particularly in five hospitals.  Different practices have resulted in great improvements for the benefit of patients. Challenges exist in other places, some of which relate to the physical capacity of facilities in places such as Drogheda.  Money is being provided this year to provide new facilities there.The initial target was 12 hours, which I accept is a long time.  The next target will be six hours.  Setting a target is not a sensible idea if one does not have the wherewithal to measure it.  The HSE is setting up procedures so that a target of six hours can be set in October.  I hope this can be reduced further.More than 90% of people who present do not require admission and go home.  Those people may still have long waiting periods before being treated and leaving.  The target applies not just to those who must be admitted to an acute bed.  We also need a target for the period between arrival time and the time one is dealt with, by being admitted or sent home.  I look forward to that target being set in October.

Recently, I asked if the Minister had received the report of the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, Health and Safety Standards for Irish Emergency Departments.  I was surprised at the Minister's reply yesterday, stating she had not yet received a copy.  I have made a copy and would be happy to pass it on to the Minister.  The report states: "The persistent overcrowding in Irish EDs fundamentally contravenes this duty of care and as a result both patients and staff are exposed to significant risk on a daily basis."  Does the Minister recognise the urgency for action to relieve overcrowding in our accident and emergency units?  What further action and funding will she provide?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The implementation of many recommendations of the task force is already under way.  Many concern capacity in various hospitals.  These began during the gestation period of the task force report.  Overcrowding is something of a jigsaw.  We need more consultants on duty in hospitals, more access to diagnostics and more measures taking place at community level.  All of these make an impact on accident and emergency units.  Until relatively recently, there was one hospital on call in one part of the city and one hospital in the other.  Now, we have accident and emergency units everywhere.In those years they were for genuine accidents and emergencies.  Today our accident and emergency departments are dealing with people who have chronic illness because it is not being appropriately managed in the community or with people who need diagnostic care because they are waiting so long.  That is why, in time, the other measures that have been put in place by the HSE will have a significant impact.  When I had a long meeting last week with Professor Drumm — whom I had not met since prior to the general election being called — he informed me of a number of initiatives that had been put in place by the HSE in the intervening weeks to help hospitals to achieve the kind of targets we are talking about.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	299	The target to which the Minister alluded was a six-hour target which the HSE has set itself that starts from the time the decision has been made to admit the patient.  However, even here there is disingenuity because the decision to admit the patient may well have been made by the doctor in accident and emergency but the clock does not start running until the admitting doctor from the various specialties within the hospital can make that decision.  This can often take many hours, as I know only too well.The Minister alluded to the 5% capital fund and spend in this country being second only to Norway in the OECD, yet we have the second lowest expenditure on health and education in the OECD.  As I stated in last night's debate, our GNP last year contained a 7.2% spend on health.  It has been acknowledged that we have fallen behind in health spending due to the many cutbacks in the 1980s and 1990s and that we are playing catch-up.  Will the Minister outline how we can possibly catch up when we are still spending less per capita than the European average, which is 8.6% and Germany and France which are at 10%?I am pleased to hear the Minister is looking outside accident and emergency services because this area is merely the symptom of the problem.  A bottleneck has been caused by a lack of beds and inappropriate use of beds on the one hand and a lack of diagnostics, to which the Minister has alluded, but also the lack of a proper preventative medical scheme.  Fine Gael had promoted the latter, in addition to a chronic illness scheme prior to the general election to keep people out of hospital and identify illness early.  It is well known that for every euro one spends on prevention, one saves €20 on treatment.I recall the Minister referred to the accident and emergency crisis as a national emergency but I do not recall when she declared that was no longer the case.  Perhaps she will inform the House of when she made that announcement.Where are the acute medical admission units that were promised?  One such unit was promised for Beaumont Hospital on the north side of Dublin.  This would have alleviated the situation in accident and emergency departments.  GPs are highly experienced doctors who, when they have seen patients and examined them, know whether they need admission.  It is regrettable to have to route patients through accident and emergency departments and for them to have to put up with all the unpleasantness that goes with that kind of experience in the current poorly-funded health system.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I object to Deputy Reilly's statement that our health system is totally underfunded.  I cannot remember the exact words he used.  I do not know whether he referred to GDP or GNP.  He may be referring to 2005 figures.  If one takes the spending in 2007 and compares it on a per capita basis with purchasing power, parity and so on with many other countries, including France, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, we compare most favourably.  The issue we have all recognised in Ireland over the past decade as we multiplied public spending on the health system fourfold, is that spending alone would not resolve the challenges without changing how we do business.When the figure of 500 patients on trolleys was reached on a particular day for the first time in March 2006, I said the HSE had to apply itself to the task of resolving the challenges in accident and emergency services as if it were a national emergency, which it did.  We have seen improvements of 40% to 60% over the past 12 months.  That has been acknowledged by an organisation of which Deputy Reilly is a member, as well as the INO and others.Admission lounges and facilities are being put in place.  I do not have the date of when this will happen in Beaumont Hospital but during the remainder of this year and next year, huge——

There are two types of unit.  I understand Tallaght Hospital has just got an admission lounge and other hospitals are getting acute assessment medical units.I fully agree with Deputy Reilly that we need to have the kind of measures in place which I know he would like from a general practitioner perspective, in particular for the management of chronic illness in the community.  Many patients, especially older people who thankfully are living longer, have chronic illnesses such as diabetes and if such illnesses can be managed, we will relieve pressure on the acute hospital system.

The Minister stated there are many pieces to the jigsaw when dealing with the accident and emergency services problem.  Does the Minister agree and acknowledge that the major problem is the availability of acute hospital beds and, as she noted in reply to an earlier question, that beds are being used inappropriately?  Moreover, does she acknowledge that beds are being used inappropriately because of the Government's total failure to provide necessary step-down facilities?  I refer to those people who have been through the worst of their illness, are not sufficiently well to return home and who need continuing care but who do not require acute hospital care.  Does she accept that the Government has contributed to the national emergency that was created last year and that the problems in accident and emergency will not be resolved until it takes up its obligations to provide the requisite step-down facilities?  Does she accept that these are the facilities that should be provided within those hospitals now designated for co-location and the construction of private hospitals?

As this figure does not include the number occupying beds that have given rise to the cancellation of day care procedures, the real figure is much higher.  On the matter of targets, I am a little confused in respect of the six-hour and 12-hour targets to be set in October on foot of this report.  It seems the Minister is missing the targets and is opting out of the placing of targets.  Unless she sets clearly defined targets that will be met, this issue will not be dealt with in a satisfactory manner.

A number of things must be done.  Obviously, rehabilitation capacity is also important as many people in the acute system await rehabilitation.  This is the reason the building of the new hospital and additional rehabilitation capacity is important.  I understand that one of the co-location proposals, from Blanchardstown, may include step-down facilities.As for trolleys, some people spend all their time, perhaps 24 hours, being observed on a trolley.  Recently, a close friend of mine who would be known to many Members had such an experience in a Dublin hospital.  He told me it was a very pleasant experience.  There will always be people on trolleys and many people are treated on them.  The issue is the length of time someone must wait to be dealt with in an accident and emergency department.  Some of the private clinics that have opened in the Dublin area, which have been subject to much criticism, operate a target of one or two hours from the time one enters to the time one leaves.  I accept they deal with minor injuries.

Through the Chair, some of the issues that arise concern privacy, as well as whether someone is on a trolley.  Many issues exist, which is the reason that capacity improvements and creating a better environment, including the provision of toilet and other facilities, constitute part of what we seek to do.As for the setting of targets, we never had them until some time ago when we set the 12-hour target.  The six-hour target will be from the time one arrives and not simply from the time one is seen.  I accept Deputy Reilly's point that it is not simply when the accident and emergency consultant decides that one may require admission but when someone else in the house comes down and so decides.  In the first instance, we seek a target of six hours from the time one presents until one can either go home or be admitted to an acute bed.

I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 78 together.The final outturn on Vote expenditure for the HSE showed a capital saving of €114 million, of which €42 million was used to offset a revenue overspend and a further €47 million was used to offset a shortfall in projected appropriations-in-aid.  This left a balance of €25 million to be surrendered to the Exchequer.  The HSE's appropriation account for 2006 will show an overall surrender of €365 million comprising the €25 million capital saving and €340 million in respect of the long-stay payments.Unspent capital funding cannot automatically be transferred from one year to the next.  However, under section 91 of the Finance Act 2004, Departments and the HSE may apply to carry over up to 10% of any net underspend on the capital Vote to the following year.  If approved by the Minister for Finance, provision for such carry-over is made in the Appropriation Act for that year.  However, the HSE was not in a position to provide a firm projection of its net capital expenditure saving for 2006 within the prescribed time limit.  As a result, the Appropriation Act 2006 does not include any provision for the HSE to carry over its €25 capital saving.The HSE has taken steps to strengthen its capital management capacity, including the establishment of a single estates function and the appointment of a new director of estates.  The level of capital funding provided to the HSE for 2007 will support a continuing high level of investment in our public health services and will enable the completion and commissioning of many new acute and community health care facilities.

Why was Bantry General Hospital's orthopaedic service withdrawn four years ago?  While orthopaedic facilities had been available for years, they were withdrawn for some unknown reason.  A minor fracture cannot be treated in that major county hospital.  Fracture patients from the south-west Cork and south Kerry regions must travel more than 100 miles to Cork University Hospital for treatment.  That should have been taken into consideration and that facility should have been provided.

There would be no need to return €71 million to the Exchequer.Where is the €97.7 million, also allocated to the HSE due to be spent?

In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:"PART 1ANOMALIES IN THE STAMP DUTY REGIME1.—It shall be a function of the Commission on Taxation to be established by the Government to examine anomalies in the stamp duty regime including the plight of families and individuals leaving properties such as apartments to trade up to an affordable family home.".I begin by congratulating you, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on taking up your office.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The purpose of this amendment is to charge the proposed commission on taxation with examining the anomalies in the stamp duty regime.  During last night's brief Second Stage debate, I had time only to refer to the situation of those people caught out by the backdating to 31 March.  There are other anomalies relating to stamp duty, which I hope the Minister will review.One of these relates to the capacity of developers, builders and others engaged in the construction sector to employ mechanisms for the avoidance of stamp duty, either through licensing arrangements or through the sale of shares in a company so that the transfer rate is that applicable to shares as opposed to the residential rate of 9%.  These avoidance mechanisms are part of the same old story.  People on modest incomes who purchase modest properties, including those trading up, are subject to a fairly high level of stamp duty.  I acknowledge that stamp duty is high in Ireland probably because we do not have the year-on-year property taxes that exist in many other European countries.  We have instead one regime which applies the full weight of stamp duty to people purchasing houses in which to reside and another which allows the construction industry and people who buy significant properties to make use of avoidance mechanisms.  During the previous Dáil, the Minister conceded on a number of occasions in debates on stamp duty that he was concerned the people to whom I refer were avoiding payment.  He introduced an amendment to the last Finance Act to tighten up some of the stamp duty avoidance mechanisms, particularly in regard to licensing arrangements, but he failed to have the relevant sections commenced.This is an area that deserves scrutiny by a commission on taxation from the point of view of equity and tax justice for people in the PAYE sector.  It is difficult enough for people to pay tax at any time, but it is particularly galling to believe that one law exists for people on modest incomes in the PAYE sector and an entirely different one for multi-millionaires.  We have seen significant property transactions being conducted in certain parts of Dublin, such as the sale of hotels in Ballsbridge.  I challenge the Minister to indicate how many of those transactions were subject to the 9% rate of stamp duty.  I am confident that a large proportion were effected by the transfer of shares attracting a lower rate.  I have put these questions to the Minister on previous occasions and wonder whether he will comment.I do not want to fight the general election again because the people have voted and we have an outcome.  The position taken by Fianna Fáil on stamp duty was a fix-up solution of creating an absolute exemption for all first-time buyers regardless of the value or size of the property.  Last September the Progressive Democrats Party brought stamp duty to the national stage as an election issue, with Michael McDowell taking to the airwaves to argue for major changes to stamp duty on the grounds that most of the income derived by the Government was unnecessary and allowed for tax reliefs worth billions of euro.  However, even the Progressive Democrats argued that a house with a floor area in excess of 1,350 sq. ft., or an average three or four bedroom house, should not be totally exempt from stamp duty.  The present proposal is to completely exempt all first-time buyers.  We have no problem with exemptions for those purchasing modest former local authority houses worth €400,000 or €500,000 in Cabra, Finglas or elsewhere in the Dublin area.  However, a person who has the means, as a first-time buyer, to buy a luxury residence for €6 million or €7 million, will be completely exempt from stamp duty.  Such a person's saving on stamp duty could be multiples of the cost of an affordable home.The second anomaly, which is a serious social problem that the Minister must address, is that in the past seven years the development of affordable housing has meant that many couples have bought an apartment.  They are now in a position where they have, or intend to have, a family and they need to trade up to a house.  They bought their affordable apartment free of stamp duty.  This issue is of particular concern where people are buying a second-hand property.  It is not such an acute problem outside Dublin or in rural areas where the supply of new properties at affordable prices is much greater.  However, in cities such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, where second-hand properties are often all that is available to people in the areas where they work, they face very significant stamp duty bills although their means are modest.  The position of people who are trading up to buy a family home in which to reside should be the subject of some concern by the Government.While the Minister's proposals to increase mortgage interest relief are welcome they do not address the fact that people who move from an apartment to a three or four bedroom house to cater for a family may, depending on where they buy, face stamp duty bills of between €25,000 and €70,000.  That is a lot of money, representing a very large additional mortgage commitment.  I urge the Minister and his officials to examine this issue in the context of housing and social needs.These are some of the areas that the commission on taxation, when formed, should examine.  The Labour Party shares the Minister's concern that the revenue base from stamp duty be conserved.  The pre-budget estimates and review suggested that the total take on stamp duty last year from first-time buyers was approximately €70 million.  The stamp duty take from first-time buyers buying properties worth less than €635,000, that is, the people to whom I have referred, was €66 million.  In the Fianna Fáil manifesto, the Minister estimated that for the rest of 2007, mortgage interest relief and stamp duty relief would cost €88 million.  Therefore, the price of the package before us is relatively modest.I appreciate that the Minister's objective is to conserve part of the taxation base, but there are key people who not being facilitated by this move.  The biggest problem is for individuals and couples who have or intend to have a family but have lost their first-time buyer status because they bought an apartment.  If the apartment is on the fringes of Dublin or other cities, the capital appreciation may not be significant.  They now need to buy a family home to live in.  They are not investors and their plight is one of particular concern.  I hope the Minister will address this issue.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19827	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I welcome the amendment tabled by Deputy Burton which goes to the heart of the debate on this Bill.  Deputy Burton opens up the issue of addressing anomalies that have arisen in stamp duty.  I agree with the Deputy that the Bill before us today is only a partial response to the problems that have been created by the stamp duty structure.The Minister does not need me to tell him that the thresholds on stamp duty are entirely different from those that operate within the income tax code, for example.  One does not have a band that is exempt, a band that is at a certain rate, with only the excess over a certain price charged at the top rate.  The effect of this on families has been savage.  It means that for every 1% increase in house prices, we have seen a 4% increase in the stamp duty bill.  This has had a massive impact on very ordinary families, particularly in Dublin.  In 2002, the stamp duty on an average house in Dublin was €9,000, which many people thought was a great deal of money, although perhaps it was affordable.  However, today, the stamp duty on a similar house is €41,000.  House prices in the intervening period have grown by 75% but the stamp duty bill has quadrupled.  There is no justice in that and the people who are being singled out for this tax are not in the investor or speculator category.  They are not super rich, but ordinary families who want to buy in a neighbourhood with established services.  They include people who need to move on and make a fresh start following the breakdown of a marriage, or people who want to move from a one-bedroom apartment to a house.  Why should these people be singled out for savage tax treatment?In no other area of the taxation code has the yield quadrupled in a four-year period.  Under no other tax are people asked to pay €41,000 in one fell swoop, the equivalent of an entire annual salary of many who are in the first-time buyer market.  There is no justice in that and, as Deputy Burton stated, these anomalies were unintentional.  As the former Minister Charlie McCreevy told us, the taxation code was designed by William of Orange and dates back to a long time ago when the world as we know it was never envisaged.  We need to consolidate the code and bring people back into the inner cities where there is property.  That was not a consideration of William of Orange.  The code must be modernised, workable and accepted as fair.  This is a task for the 30th Dáil.The Minister for Finance has not been keen to reform stamp duty, but he now has five years in which to think about it.  He has agreed to a taxation commission, which should be mandated to look at it as the amendment requests.  I would go much further and I have tabled an amendment seeking to immediately reform this tax.  I will not rerun the debate during the general election but many believe the tax we are exacting from the housing market is unfair, unjust, unsustainable and incoherent.  This tax is important to many families and also in the context of long-term competitiveness because the way the housing market has gone is undermining the whole competitive base of the economy.  This is not the only area of the taxation code that must be reformed but it is an important step in producing a system that is equitable and fair.

It is a matter for another day.I support amendment No. 2 tabled by Deputy Burton.  We highlighted a number of statistics on Second Stage but when one takes on board that 36,000 out of the 38,000 first-time buyers in 2006 paid no stamp duty, it demonstrates that the numbers who will benefit from the Minister's stated intent in this legislation will be extremely small.  More worrisome is that those who will benefit are most likely to be those who can most afford to pay the stamp duty demand.  We cannot lose sight of this in evaluating the steps to be taken.  The average house in the State cost €278,000 in April of this year and no stamp duty is paid on houses costing less than €317,501.  While the Minister has not indicated a willingness to revisit the construction of the proposal, this amendment seeks to allow the commission on taxation to examine the anomalies that make it difficult and in some instances impossible for families to trade up.It must be recognised that many first time house purchase transactions are carried out by single people and couples without children.  However, people's circumstances change.  While they may have been very comfortable in the apartment or starter home in which they set out in life as independent adults in society, they may find that the accommodation is inadequate to meet the needs of young children and growing families.  There is every justification for addressing these anomalies that make it extremely difficult for people to trade up in line with their need.  It is important to emphasise need.  It is not that people simply aspire to something grander.  They need to move to accommodation commensurate with their family's requirements.  It is to represent them that I support this proposition.  There is a basis for an examination of what is possible in addressing the various restrictions, obstacles and curtailments currently in place for people moving up the property ladder in terms of scale to meet the needs of growing families.  I hope the Minister will respond positively.

To put it in context, in the past year some 2,000 people, approximately 5%, of the 38,000 first-time buyers paid stamp duty.  It is an immaterial number.  The €70 million collected from a total intake from stamp duty of €4 billion will have little, if any, impact in terms of the housing market.  The Government has missed a golden opportunity to properly reform the stamp duty regime which is currently inequitable.  It should have dealt with the issue of people trading up to their second home.Traditionally people buying their second home buy in the second-hand market rather than going back into the new house market.  First-time buyers have no equity.  However, people who have sold their house are moving with equity.  The problem is that they are selling to a first-time buyer who will pay no stamp duty but they themselves must pay stamp duty if they are buying a second-hand house.  If the house costs €300,000 the stamp duty will be 5%, just short of €16,000.  It is not my intention to rehash my party's general election proposals, but one of our proposals was to reduce stamp duty to 3%, which would have brought the stamp duty down to €10,000.  It would have meant an extra €6,000 for the person trading up.  That is an opportunity the Government missed.  People may not be aware that a homeowner buying a second-hand home is in the same position as an investor.  That should not be the case.  This is an anomaly that should be examined by the commission on taxation.The problem is that what is proposed in this Bill will achieve very little.  All it does is eliminate stamp duty for 2,000 of 38,000 first-time buyers.  It does nothing for the person moving house, and there are various reasons people move.  Should they be penalised if they have to move from one area of the country to another by reason of their job or because there has been an increase in the size for their family?  This Bill, as far as I am concerned, is nothing but a sham.  It does nothing for the genuine home owner who wants to move house.  The irony is that approximately 99% of first-time buyers purchasing outside the main Dublin area pay no stamp duty.  This Bill does nothing in terms of the proper reform of stamp duty which should take place.  The proposed commission on taxation should examine this issue.  We should push forward to ensure a fairer stamp duty system.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	350	This Bill could be described as a minimalist measure.  I support the proposed amendment.The real problem with stamp duty, as it has now developed, is that it has become an unfair tax.  We have learned in this House down through the years that if we ignore an unfair tax, difficulties are created.  I do not believe the reform proposed by the Minister will resolve the difficulties in the housing market created by the barriers which stamp duty pose.I welcome that the Minister is providing relief for first-time home buyers.  However, I agree with Deputy Burton that we are now in the anomalous position whereby a person who has lived in rented accommodation and not purchased a residential property and succeeds through business in becoming wealthy or wins the national lottery will be able, as a first-time buyer, to purchase a house worth €3 million and not have to pay any stamp duty.This issue needs to  be addressed by the commission simply because the Minister has turned his face against any other amendments to this particular inequitable duty.  Clearly, we do not have the numbers in this House to succeed with the amendments which will be discussed later.The reality is that an elderly retired couple living in Dublin in a relatively modest semi-detached home worth €900,000 to €950,000 wishing to downsize to an even more modest home or apartment worth in the region of €500,000 to €600,000 will be penalised by the State to the tune of 7.5%.  It is not possible to buy a reasonable sized apartment in south Dublin for less than approximately €500,000.  It is practically impossible to buy anything for less than that amount.  There is no reason a retired individual, an elderly individual or an elderly couple wishing to downsize should be penalised by having to pay €35,000 to €60,000 in stamp duty.  A fairer system, if stamp duty is imposed, would require those moving home to pay stamp duty on the difference between the moneys realised from the sale of the home and the cost of the new house being purchased.  Also, where a person downsizes and purchases a smaller home, stamp duty would not apply.The problem with the Minister's proposal is that for many of the elderly their homes are their only investments and they see the difference between the sale price of their home and the purchase of smaller homes as providing them with some security for the future, but the State will relieve them of €40,000 to €60,000 of that sum.  Stamp duty is an unfair tax in that context.  It is equally unfair that young married couples who are trapped in small apartments and wish to trade up are given no relief by this particular measure.I support the amendment.  I know this issue will be discussed in greater detail later.  If a commission on taxation is to look at this matter, I suggest that it be looked at inventively.  Is there any reason stamp duty, which amounts to an enormous sum, should be paid in one payment?  Should an instalment system be available as an alternative where, for example, added interest could be paid if one chooses to pay by instalment?  Many people would find it much easier to move home if stamp duty could be paid on an instalment rather than on a once-off basis.  No thought has been given to that.We will have to return to this issue at a future stage.  This legislation will lead to movement in the housing market with regard to first-time home buyers.  However, we must also encourage elderly and retired people who want to trade down to do so and make available existing housing stock for married couples with children who are seeking to trade up.  The barrier which stamp duty creates for such elderly people will not be removed.  That issue must be addressed.

The tenor of the legislation is clear and is to be welcomed.  I compliment the Minister on the Bill, which will deal with the question of first-time buyers and will bring stability to the market.  The introduction of the Bill honours a commitment given by the Minister prior to the election.  He is to be complimented on honouring that commitment.The amendment would bring back an element of instability by raising the possibility of what might or might not happen between now and budget day or the date of some future decision.  That is the last thing the construction industry wants.  The two parallel tenors of the bill are clear and the people have decided that this is what they want.  They supported what the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party put forward.  Others set out their stalls and were rejected.  Some of those stalls would have been helpful to the 50,000 sellers with little recognition of the needs of first-time buyers.The point has been made that a first-time buyer could be a multi-millionaire and would be exempt from stamp duty, but that argument does not make sense to me.  Why would such a person never have thought of buying a house until now?  If a small number of Lotto winners wish to buy their first houses, so be it.I welcome the Bill.  We must make it clear that first-time buyers may purchase houses without paying stamp duty and that stability has been restored to the market.  To extend this exemption to others who are already on the property ladder would take from the tenor of the Bill, which is to look after first-time buyers and to restore stability to the market.

One of the purposes of this legislation is to put the stamp duty issue to bed and end the uncertainty and instability surrounding it.  Anything else that may be done from time to time can be done in a budgetary context, thus taking stamp duty out of the realm of speculation.  I found the picture painted by Deputy Shatter, of a modest home worth €950,000 owned by an elderly couple, to be absolutely surreal.  Perhaps they were there for 20 or 30 years and may have paid £9,000, £19,000 or £29,000 for that modest home.  Enormous capital gains have been made by people who own homes in the Dublin area and elsewhere.  In some cases, the value of homes has appreciated by several thousand percent over 20 or 30 years.  The argument is now being proposed that people who have made such gains and are trading down, should not pay a relatively small amount in tax to support social welfare services.  I do not know where equity has gone in the argument over stamp duty.  I have not seen any of the groups or agencies concerned with poverty issues talking about this matter.  In any case, that particular suggestion is somewhat removed from Deputy Burton's amendment.  The giveaway word in that amendment is "affordable", which is what the buyer can afford.  It is well known that if buyers do not have to pay stamp duty they can afford more.  That is why very often, unfortunately, well meant concessions have the effect of driving up prices, so one ends up paying as much but with the difference that the State does not get the benefit.We need to pay some attention to the tax base.  We have been running healthy public finances and have had a reasonable surplus in recent times, but we must be careful not to erode the tax base.  Twenty years ago, I can remember the Labour Party bemoaning the lack of proper capital or corporation tax revenue.  Under both those headings, revenues have now increased exponentially.  In the case of corporation tax it is because of prosperity, investment and bringing the rate down to 12.5%, which made it worthwhile to do business in this country.  I accept the Labour Party was also involved in this.  In 1986, revenue from capital taxation was approximately £36 million, while corporation tax accounted for about £257 million.  Revenue from those sources has increased enormously, however, which has enabled us to do a whole lot more.  Therefore, the Labour Party in particular should think carefully about how much it wants to erode the capital tax base.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	353	On amendment No. 2, the programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a commission on taxation, which would give a wide remit to consider the structure of the taxation system.  The commission will be charged with examining the balance achieved between taxes collected on income capital and spending and reporting on it and reviewing all tax expenditures with a view to making recommendations on those that are unjustifiable and those that can continue to be justified on a cost-benefit basis.  The commission will also have the opportunity, as mentioned in the programme for Government, to consider options for the future financing of local government.  In the context of maintaining a strong economy, it will investigate measures to protect and enhance the environment, including the introduction of a carbon levy or tax.I will bring proposals to Government in the near future on matters relating to the establishment of the proposed commission, including formal terms of reference, but I do not consider it appropriate that the terms of reference be the subject of legislative provision, as envisaged in the amendment.The Government's position on stamp duty is clearly set out in the programme for Government and our emphasis is on assisting first-time buyers who are those most in need of assistance.  This has been the consistent approach of successive Governments of different political compositions for the reasons I have given and to which Deputy Kieran O'Donnell adverted.  We have committed to the abolition of stamp duty for all first-time buyers and this is being addressed in this second Finance Bill.  We have also committed to increasing the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers in the next budget, having doubled it in the last budget from €4,000 to €8,000 for a single person and from €8,000 to €16,000 for a married couple.  The changes to the ceiling on mortgage interest relief will affect first-time buyers and those who bought a house in the past seven years so there are more beneficiaries than merely those currently in the housing market.Having doubled mortgage interest relief in the last budget, I will propose in the next budget changing it from €8,000 to €10,000 for single people and from €16,000 to €20,000 for couples or widowed persons.  I will also propose maintaining this tax relief at 20% for all home owners even in the event of future income tax rate reductions that were also envisaged in our manifesto on the basis of maintaining a strong economy.This is what we said we would do when we went to the people and I now feel honour-bound to enact our proposals.  There has been a vigorous debate, in part instigated by others, and the issue has had a full airing in the public domain and in political debate for some time, although people will probably continue to disagree on it.Deputy Mansergh referred to re-inflation and this is something that has not been thought through.  At the moment we are seeing a correction and a reduction in housing output and this must take place because double-digit house price inflation is unsustainable.  It could have caused an unhealthy housing environment where issues of affordability were prevalent.  There have been eight mortgage interest rate increases of one quarter of one percent and this has also softened the market.  These matters are not in our direct control but are decisions made by the European Central Bank in the interest of price stability in the euro area.Even allowing for this, we are in a much more benign interest rate regime now then ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  The issue here is to have a targeted and affordable initiative that will address the matter of getting people on the first rung of the housing ladder.  The point made by Deputy Mansergh in response to Deputy Shatter is fair.  We have seen huge gains in capital appreciation for the category of person under discussion, although I accept that they are mentioned merely as an example.  The fact is that there is no annualised property tax in this country, as has been mentioned, and we have a full principal private residence exemption in respect of capital gains in the event of sale.  The argument that the imposition of the tax duty might prevent a person trading down, in the context of capital appreciation with a full tax exemption, does not stand up to robust scrutiny.  The payment of stamp duty by instalments, as has been suggested, could have implications for the registration of title in the registries.  As Deputy Shatter will be aware, documents presented to the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds must be stamped with the full duty chargeable under the stamp duty code.Notwithstanding the ideas and suggestions made by the Opposition, as Deputy Finneran noted, the context of this debate is the need to bring stability and certainty to the market.  Strong views have been expressed in the discussion of these matters.  Let us not forget that when the Fine Gael proposal, which was subsequently supported by the Labour Party, emerged it resulted in continuing uncertainty.  This has been documented.I could not see how it was equitable, sensible or a good idea to sort out a perceived problem facing the 53,000 people who enter the property market in a given year by changing the taxation code at a cost of up to €600 million — the anticipated figure for year two or three following implementation of the measure — to be paid for by 2.2 million other people in tax forgone.  It is inevitable that we will return to a political debate during our interaction this afternoon.  I regarded the proposal as a vote-catching exercise because it failed the basic equity tests.I concur with Deputy Burton that it is important to protect the tax base.  While this does not preclude reform, it precludes introducing measures costing hundreds of millions of euro annually to address a matter related to purchases of residential property, which last year affected 54,000 people.  The focus of much of the argument has been the high cost of stamp duty for houses costing more than the threshold of €635,000.  The 4,500 people who bought houses above this threshold last year would be significant beneficiaries under the Opposition proposals.At some stage, one must ask what we are trying to achieve.  Our purpose is to assist people to get into the property market and stabilise and bring some certainty to the market.  In so doing, we want to be equitable and ensure any measures we introduce are affordable.As Minister for Finance, I argued my case within the constraints imposed upon me by my office because any comments I make will be picked up by the market.  It is a misrepresentation of my comments to contend, as has been done continually, that I stated there would be no change.  I said three things, namely, that I would not enter into speculation, that anything we would do would assist first-time purchasers — I have introduced two initiatives to assist first-time buyers in three budgets — and that I would not do anything to disrupt the market.  I did not say I would not do anything.I found the span and scope of the proposals made by the Opposition parties to be disruptive of the market because they would have a reflationary effect in a period in which a correction to bring longer term sustainability and stability to the market is taking place.  The benefits of their proposals would not go to the purchaser in the vast majority of or even all cases.  As Deputy Mansergh stated on the issue of affordability, if, in a sellers market, the stamp duty imposition on a house costing €350,000 is reduced to €10,000, another €20,000 in equity becomes available to the buyer.  That is the way the market works.  These basic dynamics, which are observable to all, greatly invalidated what I am sure was a well-intentioned effort to introduce comprehensive reform of stamp duty.  I still do not believe it is the right way to go.  There will be those on the other side of the House who will defend their position and continue to argue with me about it.As was noted, this issue has been discussed.  We have hit every door in Ireland and said what we would do.  We are here in Government and I am honour bound to do this.  If the Members opposite were on this side of the House, they would tell me what they intended to do.  Fine Gael intended to do this over a three-year period.  It was pretty indeterminate as to when it would happen but it was going to happen at some stage.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The Labour Party leader said it would be done as he was coming down in the car from Áras an Uachtaráin.  That is how matters progress, how the debate develops and how it all works out in the end.When he was in the Seanad, Deputy Mansergh made the point on the Finance Bill at the time this issue was raging — he repeated it in recent days — that we need to be careful because issues such as this require to be dealt with in the budgetary context.  I am not suggesting we should impose a vow of silence in terms of policy initiatives coming up to elections — they are the reality and it is a democratic debate.  If the people want to raise the issue, as they did, we respond.  However, while we had a trenchant debate on the matter, none of us can deny there were behavioural consequences as a result of that debate in that an expectation was created, one way or the other, which had the effect of causing some dislocation to the market.  It was not the exclusive cause because, obviously, the increase in interest rates has also had a gradual effect in the past couple of years and, in some respects, as I have said, that correction is welcome.  However, the debate has had an adverse effect.I am not sure how we manage this for the future but there is a responsibility on all of us to try to have these debates within a certain period, after which decisions are taken and we move on rather than creating prolonged uncertainty, which has had a detrimental effect in this case.  It is not uncertainty from which the building industry need not recover — I do not suggest that is the case.  However, I felt that if the initial manifestation of the policy emanating from the opposite side were to operate over a three-year period, it would have a very detrimental effect.  In any case, that issue was clarified over a period.Issues such as this are dealt with by way of resolution on the day of the budget because we want to make sure a new situation applies the next day, whether in the context of excise, stamp duty or any other matter.  We do this so people do not speculate on the basis of what it is we are trying to achieve and take an unfair advantage.The other point is that we must not talk down the economy.  We can continue with good, strong growth rates.  While we recognise there is no room for complacency, we have a wider responsibility, beyond our party political interests or defending the respective positions which we have trenchantly argued recently, to make sure we do not inject a sentiment into the economic debate that would be a prophecy of doom.  We must not worsen a situation which needs to recover by injecting that intangible sentiment.  To do so would have an effect because all of us, as public representatives in our local areas and in our areas of responsibility, are in touch with people in the industry in every respect.When I talk about the industry, I am talking about the 280,000 people who work in it — the tradesmen and workers, not just those who own construction companies or land banks.  Almost 14% of our workforce gets up every morning and goes to work in this industry.  Not all of them work in the residential sector but it is a very important sector, quite apart from our public works projects, which we intend to increase as a percentage of our overall economic activity in the coming years under the national development plan.The point is that as this correction takes place, we will move from the high of 90,000 completions.  Ten years ago there were 33,000 completions, but last year 93,000 were registered, some of which, approximately 5,000, were an overhang from the previous year.  Let us assume there were 88,000 last year and that we move towards approximately 75,000 this year and 70,000 in subsequent years.  We need to get the kind of path in terms of housing output that will not have an adverse effect on confidence in the economy generally, that will maintain employment in the residential sector to the greatest extent possible and that will help in the take up of our increased public work programme and capital programmes in all the areas of social and physical infrastructure we see being rolled out year on year.  We must ensure we get through this period in a way that reinforces rather than saps confidence in the industry so as to avoid the worst adverse effects a correction may bring.We all recognise there is a softening in the market and we need to avoid doing anything to make the situation appear worse.  I do not suggest anyone here is engaged in that, but sometimes in the heat of debate a situation can be portrayed to the public as being worse than it is or it can be suggested that the situation cannot be corrected quickly so we can move on at a level of activity far greater in historic terms than would have been the average ten or 15 years ago.It is for this important reason that we have brought forward our proposal.  I do not take away from the sincerity of the arguments of the Opposition, nor do I suggest or speculate that the proposal is for other reforms.  All matters relating to tax base, revenues and spending plans are part of the budgetary context, which is an annual process.  The issue here is to bring certainty to the market and send a clear signal on the plan for the forseeable future, based on the initiatives we are taking.  They are targeted at the first-time buyer and by definition are affordable in the overall macro-economic and fiscal framework that was the basis for the proposals we put to the country.  The wider, what the Opposition would call more comprehensive but what I would call more scatter-gun, approach that thinks we can deal with every segment of the market in the same way, with a cost of hundreds of millions for 53,000 or 54,000 people annually which would be paid for by 2.15 million other workers, seems to be an approach that would not lend itself to stability or certainty nor enable the correction to take place and reduce the double digit house price inflation that has been a characteristic of our very buoyant and, in recent years, overheated market.  The market is now heading towards stability with prices heading back to where they were in August last year.  Let us ensure that as a result of the passing of this legislation, the market will take the positive signal it is meant to send and housing output will recover, not back to the record levels of last year, but to a level where we get the soft landing that is in the interest of everybody, including the tens and hundreds of thousands of people who depend on the industry for a livelihood.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I listened with interest to the Minister's points and understand why, as Minister for Finance, he argues his point regarding taxes forgone and the cost of Fine Gael-Labour proposals in the area.  With respect, he is looking at the issue from a narrow point of view and ignores important facts.  The increases in the cost of housing for young people and people who find it necessary to trade up because of an increase in family size have led to significant personal indebtedness.It is very easy not to do anything about stamp duty and just tag it on as another part of the costs of a house.  However, the result, as we have seen over recent years, is that personal indebtedness increases enormously.   When the Minister argues about the loss of revenue he ignores what is happening on the other side.  If my personal debt goes up I will look for an increase in salary or wages and that has a knock-on effect on the overall performance of the economy.  Two people in a household will have to work outside the home to cover the repayments and the cost of child care.  Recent budgets have endeavoured to deal with child care costs.It is foolish to ignore the cost of housing.  Dublin Deputies can confirm the accuracy of what I say.  My son's end-of-terrace, three-bedroom house in Stepaside cost €420,000 off the plans.  Ten months later, phase two of the development came onto the market at €525,000 for a mid-terrace house.  That is an increase of €105,000 within ten months.  If one has the income one can borrow 110% but one is borrowing to pay the stamp duty.  That drives up demand for higher wages to meet repayments and to justify the loan one must take out to purchase the house.If the Minister argues narrowly about forgoing the income from stamp duty taxes he is correct.  He is, however, ignoring the other costs involved by not doing something about them.  There is a shortage of property for people who want, or are forced because of the sizes of their families, to trade up.  I was brought up in a three-bedroom local authority house, 45 St. Begnet's Villas, Dalkey.  Does the Minister know that those houses were sold for almost €1 million each?  That was because of the shortage of housing in my constituency.  The Minister can ignore the stamp duty element of that and say that he cannot afford to forgo the taxes but he should consider the demand that will arise for higher salaries to justify the repayments for a three-bedroom house.  The Government is not taking that into account in this debate.  It is foolish to ignore relief for people trading up or down.  This will come back to haunt us.The cost of housing is changing Irish society every day.  People pay high child care costs because they have large mortgages on three-bedroom houses.  There is no choice for couples who have children but for both partners to work.  That is not the type of society I want.  If two people want to work and pay for child care, that is their concern.A question tabled for today seeks a professional meals-on-wheels service.  The knock-on effect of the changes in society is that services that were provided on a voluntary basis must now be paid for.  Housing estates are empty during the day and there is nobody to deliver meals.  In any part of Dublin I know people in their 70s and 80s deliver meals on wheels to other people their own age who are less healthy than them.  Estates are empty and that is not people's choice — they are being forced into it.  Any costs implicit in increasing personal indebtedness and driving up salaries and wages will cause huge problems in the future, including social problems, which are the most important aspect.  From that perspective, we should do anything we can to keep the price of housing down and reduce the costs for young people and those having to trade up.My final point relates to the proposed commission on taxation.  I have no problem bringing in people to give advice on different types of taxes but any decisions on taxation should be taken in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not want outside people telling me we should have this or that tax — we should be able to make such decisions ourselves as the elected representatives.  We should by all means seek advice but far too much is being done outside these Chambers.  I hope any decisions taken will be properly debated in this House so that we do not wake up one morning and find that some agreement has been entered into with outside bodies without our having had the opportunity to debate the issues.I am more interested in the type of society we will end up with.  I cannot speak with authority for rural Ireland but have considerable experience in the cities, which I have represented for a number of years.  What is happening is frightening and we should do anything we can to help people get a decent home for themselves with a reasonable mortgage.  The argument should not solely focus on the loss of revenue from changes to stamp duty but should look at the subject in a broader context.  That is what the Fine Gael and Labour Party proposals in the last election attempted to do.I took part in a similar debate on radio with the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, recently and I will make my point again.  With the greatest respect to the two Ministers sitting opposite, 41% of people voted for their proposals and 59% against.  They should not forget that.  They cannot say their proposals for stamp duty received a mandate from the people as they did not.  The Government is entitled, if it has the numbers, to vote through whatever policies it wishes but it did not win the argument at the election as 59% of the people disagreed with its proposals, while 41% agreed.

His point was, however, well articulated.  As we all knocked on constituency doors we all came across stamp duty as an issue.  It is not a question of looking at the issue with a narrow financial focus — I am talking about equity.  Why, as would be the case in the fully developed version of the Deputy's proposal, should 2.1 million people pay for a reform for 54,000, costing €600 million to €700 million of taxpayers' money?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19827	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	362	This tax raised €350 million four years ago but today it raises €1.5 billion.  The Minister has increased the amount of money it takes from people in this regard by a massive amount in four years.  It is not as if the Minister is saying from a static point of view that we need to give a concession to people who are paying stamp duty.  He is looking at a market where he has exacted a huge extra volume of money.  That is why there is such a sense of unfairness about this tax.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	363	That is a point of view.  However, the main point is that we have seen a reduction of taxes on labour and moving towards taxes on capital.  That has happened.  Since we came into office, the capital tax take as a percentage of total tax revenues has risen in this administration from 4.6% to almost 16% last year.  That is a fourfold increase from the time we came into office.  We did that to make sure that we reduce taxes on labour to promote employment as part of our economic strategy of having a greater number of people working.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19827	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	364	The Government has done that because house prices have exploded.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	365	These are choices.  About 70% of the windfall elements of capital taxation went towards further reducing national debt.  That is what one does with windfall taxes.  One does not project forward provisional services on the basis of the windfall because it might not be repeated.  When the recession hit the European and the wider economy in 2001, we saw how quickly our revenue base can dwindle.  I think it was around €5 billion within 12 months, when we moved from a 10% growth rate to a 1% rate by January 2002.  That highlights a point made by Deputy Burton, which is that one must be very careful before one decides to erode the tax base by that much.  If the residential housing tax take for stamp duty is €1.3 billion, and Deputy Bruton's proposal was to cost €600 million, that means a 40% cut on the tax base under that tax head.  That is pretty significant.  As our sustainable growth rates in the future will not be the 5-7% averages that we have seen in recent years, but more towards 4-4.5%, we will have to be careful with the tax revenues we take in.Deputy Bruton points out that the tax take has increased and is going towards the provision of services, and that is fine.  That is the change in the matrix of the tax and spend that we have, which is sustainable if we keep a healthy housing market.  I accept the point Deputy Barrett made that we have seen a rise in prices, but we have also seen a rise in output.  We were building 33,000 houses per annum ten years ago, but we are now building 93,000 houses.  This is not simply on a speculative basis, but on the basis of strong fundamentals in the economy, such as a migrant community that has come in, a rising population, greater disposable income, greater social mobility, better paid jobs, tax reforms which have put more money in people's pockets.  That is what people do when they become more prosperous.  They trade up and they buy a bigger and better house.  They can afford the luxuries that would otherwise not have been available to them when we had unemployment rates of 15% and 50,000 people were emigrating every year.  We recognise the change and we acknowledge the challenges that have come with that change.The first-time buyer has traditionally been the life blood of the new housing market.  That was always the means by which people could plan an industry.  The overall policy of successive governments was to promote home ownership and we now have a very high level of home ownership here, when compared to our European counterparts.  However, total housing per capita still has some way to go to meet the housing stock of more advanced European economies.  The Central Bank states 60,000 to 65,000 units per year are sustainable in the mid to long term.  We must now move from 88,000 units to 65,000 units with a soft landing so that we can sustain that level of growth, continued tax revenues, employment, etc., on the basis of an annual housing output which, even at that stage, would be twice the housing output of ten years ago.  That is the change in the level of economic activity we sustain in this economy because of strong fundamentals, demographics, rising incomes, etc.  Despite rises in interest rates in recent years, the interest rate regime is benign compared to that which applied ten or 15 years ago.Ending discrimination so that first-time buyers get the full exemption on purchasing a new or a second-hand house increases a first-time buyer's range of choice.  We must have regard to the social aspects of not having to buy in a new housing estate away from the immediate family circle if a second-hand home is available in the locale to enable people to support the family cohesion, to which Deputy Barrett adverted and which is also a legitimate policy objective in the context of all of this discussion.  These are consequences that can emerge as a result of these changes, which I accept are not revolutionary but which bring certainty and stability.  People understand the message and know where they are going.The rest of the industry now can pick up.  Having had this debate for the past five or six months, we can now get on with maintaining a housing policy, which — allied to the private residential market on which we are probably concentrating in the context of this discussion — will see us, under the national development plan, fully fund the NESC requirement on social and affordable housing.  It will ensure that our planning mechanisms are in place and every area is prepared to take the required planning permission decisions to ensure that the housing supply does not get to the extent where one sees — in the area about which Deputy Barrett spoke — a vast increase in house prices far above the national averages.  My understanding of the position in that part of south County Dublin is that it is difficult for planning permission applications to get through and the level of affordable and social housing being built in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire is not what one would expect, given the population and the demand.In fairness to the construction industry, by which I mean everybody working in it because they depend on it, it has been able to respond to that requirement of growing output.  It has responded, professionalised and improved.  One does not encounter the archetypal messing builder about whom people spoke 20 or 30 years ago.  Such builders cannot survive in the far more improved market, and with the far more sophisticated customer base, which they must now serve.  All of that needs to be put into the mix.We are simply honouring a programme commitment.  I realise it does not meet the approval of the Opposition.  All I am saying is we have had that debate and I just want to honour the commitment.  Our first statement on return to office was that before the Dáil adjourned for the summer recess, we would enact this legislation so that the market and the people who require housing will know exactly where we are going after the prolonged uncertainty we had up to now.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I thank the Minister for his detailed response to the Labour Party amendment.  On the construction industry in general and its critical importance to the economy, I remind the Minister that in March construction firms employing more than five persons reduced their workforce on an annualised basis for the first time in four years.  Figures for housing starts dropped significantly for the period September to March 2007, according to Davy Stockbrokers.  The Construction Industry Federation is anticipating a sharp decline in housing output this year.  The federation refers to housing completions in the range of 70,000 to 75,000, a considerable decrease.It amuses me how difficult is the debate on one-off housing in rural constituencies.  In Fingal and Dublin West I do not generally get involved in housing applications concerning fewer than 500 to 2,000 houses.  In many of those developments the current phases are finishing and people are being let go.  Fianna Fáil does not have a monopoly on the support of people working in the building trade.  People who worked on my campaign were foremen who have been asked to go on two or three day weeks where previously they worked all the hours God sent.  We are entering a changed phase in the construction industry.  The construction industry has brought many of the problems upon itself in terms of greed and land prices.The key problem in the market is affordability, which is determined with reference to interest rates.  The European Central Bank indicates that by the end of this year we may see one or two more interest rate rises.  This will cause the affordability issue to become sharper for families.I saw a Green Party Member wander from one side of the Chamber to the other, without resting in the House to take part in the debate.  It is unfortunate that they feel too scared, nervous or shy as Government backbenchers to contribute to the debate.Regarding Deputy Mansergh's point, I recall the Green Party manifesto referring only to stamp duty relief targeting families trading down.  Those in big houses in south county Dublin, where many Green Party members and voters live, were seized of the difficulties of families trading down and younger families buying the empty nest three and four bedroom houses.  In a democratic sense it is a pity that the Green Party failed to participate in today's debate.  The Labour Party amendment, about the work of the commission on taxation, is reasonable and considered.  These issues ought to be debated in a forum where all factors were raised by me, the Tánaiste and the contributors from Fine Gael.  These factors include how we help people who seek to buy an affordable home near work and family with access to child care and schools.  How can the Dáil address that?I refer to the comments of Deputies Finneran and Mansergh.  The former found it unrealistic that wealthy first-time buyers would buy palatial homes for a couple of million euro and whose savings in stamp duty forgone would be higher than the price of an affordable home for a first-time purchaser.  There are many trust fund children in wealthy districts of this and other major cities and areas throughout the country who will have an opportunity opened up to them by Fianna Fáil to buy or be assisted in the purchase of very expensive properties.  These people will be exempted.  That is fair enough if that is the Minister's policy objective, but the focus of this policy ought to be directed at people who need assistance in the housing market.  We have our Paris Hiltons in this country who, given their trust funds and the family accumulation of wealth, do not have a problem buying and can afford to buy expensive properties.  This measure from Fianna Fáil will provide them with an incredible bonus.  Even the Progressive Democrats stated the first-time buyer relief should be restricted to houses of up to 1,350 sq. ft., the size of a modest three or four bedroom family home.The Minister referred to equity, which is an important issue.  When it comes to the construction industry, while Fianna Fáil has measures intended for the many, it always slips in a few little specials intended for the few.  The lack of any restriction on who will be the beneficiaries of this measure is yet again a large bonus for well-off people who do not especially need the assistance of stamp duty relief or for whom stamp duty relief could be restricted to a total relief of €70,000, which would bring them up to a house purchase in the €500,000 category, which is perfectly reasonable for a first-time buyer.I previously asked the Minister a question about capital gains tax.  He ignored my question on tax avoidance in regard to stamp duty, specifically by sectors of the construction industry, by the entering into of licensing arrangements.  In the previous Dáil the Minister undertook to reform that loophole which is being utilised only by certain elements in the construction industry to drive the housing market even wilder.  It deserves reform for that reason alone.  We congratulated the Minister on the late amendment he introduced to the Finance Act in this regard but he has not commenced the section.  Every developer who is involved in stamp duty avoidance by licensing arrangements has had time since the budget and Finance Act debate to sort out ongoing situations where they are avoiding stamp duty.  In parts of south County Dublin enormous transactions are taking place, for example, the purchase and sale of property in the Ballsbridge area.  Almost all of that will be done through transfer of shares, thus avoiding stamp duty.  The moneys involved are significant.The Minister referred to the equity argument, which is a fundamental of the Labour Party position.  Where is the equity in bringing in a measure which is seriously flawed when the Minister does not take the opportunity to close off the loopholes he and his officials know exist?  I expect the Minister, as a solicitor, knows well that if one can find a way of avoiding stamping a document that will get one out of the stamp duty problem, that will be the approach taken.  Instead of exchanging a property, however, if one exchanges shares, one qualifies for the share rate as opposed to the property rate.  We have heard all that before.  However, the Tánaiste has acknowledged that from the point of view of equity, it is difficult to tell someone this.I know of people who bought first-time apartments in parts of Dublin West at whatever cost they could afford at the time, say €200,000.  They did it right, got married and had a family.  Such couples now live in one bedroom apartments in west Dublin with two children.  Only one works as both cannot afford to so do because of the cost of child care and they are caught in a classic bind whereby they are now unable to trade up.  What should they do?  The local authority has told me they should go on the dole, hand back the keys to the house and abandon it.The Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, may be somewhat surprised because in Limerick, the Government is moving correctly to try to rescue such situations.  In west Dublin, however, I can produce several such families from my case list and I have spoken publicly about them.  They have appeared in the media.  The husband in one couple works for an international computer company and is on a fairly standard wage.  They married, which was a big mistake, and have two little boys of three and six years of age.  They live in a one bedroom affordable apartment that they are purchasing.  Although I have been informed officially by the council that they have a housing need, they are unable to trade up.Moreover, if they ever get to the position whereby they can trade up, they will have lost their first-time buyer status.  As they would be buying at a cost of approximately €400,000 at most, we are only talking about €25,000 to €27,000.  However, when one works for a multinational and only earns €30,000 to €35,000, one does not qualify for affordable housing.  In Fingal, which has the highest number of affordable houses, the earning criteria at present for such housing is €41,000 to €45,000.  The family in question cannot afford to have the wife working because she is obliged to mind the two children as child care costs in Dublin West are up to €300 per child per week.  They are in a series of catch-22s which discriminate against married families and which were introduced by the Government.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	368	It is particularly acute in Dublin West because houses and apartments are cheaper there.  South Dublin is more expensive and as the Tánaiste stated, he can understand the housing market there is extraordinary.  However, Dublin West more closely resembles the rest of Ireland in this regard.  Fingal is building more houses and is creating more affordable apartments.  What does one do if the family drops out of employment, walks out of the apartment, hands the keys back, reneges on the loan and goes on the public housing list?Members used to have a view that one helped such families.  However, this measure will not help them and this is the reason the amendment refers to "the plight of families and individuals leaving properties such as apartments to trade up to an affordable family home".  Fianna Fáil used to fancy itself as being family friendly.  However the Tánaiste's predecessor as Minister for Finance introduced individualisation and the law of the market, which told women in the home in particular that they should go out to work or they would be penalised otherwise.  Stamp duty in this regard is a carryover that penalises families that try to trade up.It is not beyond the wit of this Chamber and Members from all sides to devise a mechanism that does not destabilise the property market but that states that families in work should be encouraged to stay in work, as well as being encouraged and facilitated to have a home of a reasonable size.  This is the challenge faced by the Tánaiste.The Tánaiste stated that one could get a lovely detached house in many parts of his constituency for less than €300,000, but that amount would not buy a family house in most large cities and towns, particularly Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.  The challenge for the Tánaiste is to face up to the fact that families are getting a rough time and a raw deal from the Government.  Everyone on this side of the House approves of the general arrangements for first-time buyers, but the Tánaiste is missing the point.The construction industry is entering a new and more difficult phase, but many of the people in it are super-greedy.  In many ways, super-greed will kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  A way of counteracting this is to devise family-friendly policies for those who wish to trade up to affordable houses.  A mechanism to achieve this is being offered to the Tánaiste in this amendment and I hope he will accept it.

Take the example of a middle income family, where the children have been reared and the husband and wife are living together.  If the husband or wife has a serious road traffic accident and becomes disabled, they can afford to sell their house and buy a bungalow more suited to their needs because their current two-storey house would cost too much to adapt to their requirements and would otherwise be unsuitable.  Those people, who are not even looking for a grant, are being penalised.The Tánaiste and I know that grants for the adaptation of a house range from €13,000 to €20,000.  If one lives in the greater Dublin area or in the large cities, not much adaptation will take place for that sort of money, but the people in my example only want to sell their house to buy a bungalow they can adapt, not to get a grant.  They could be penalised by €70,000 or more.I am appealing to the Tánaiste's sense of social justice to show compassion to the disabled, to not burden them further.  Would the loss of revenue not be minuscule in the overall scheme of things?  It would send a strong message of real support for the disabled.  Will the Tánaiste reconsider the matter?

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	379	The Tánaiste is an intelligent man, but I do not know whether he realises fully the damage being done to the home, the family and the structure of society as we know it.  The new generation is being driven out of Dublin city and forced to commute long distances from all over the country when travelling to the city in the morning and returning home at night.  They are being forced to jam our roads, which is the traffic we are seeing.  I cannot understand why the Government does not recognise this fact and take the measures suggested to correct it.My colleague, Deputy Barrett, observed that in a ten-month period, house prices in a particular development increased by €60,000 to €80,000.  That is nothing.  There are countless instances throughout the State where house prices have increased by the same amount between morning and evening.  Such houses are advertised in the morning and having been viewed by one or two potential buyers, any who come later, are told the houses advertised at the original price are sold and those in the next batch will cost €50,000 more.The Government has been the most serious beneficiary of the housing inflation that has affected our economy in recent years.  Nothing was done to arrest that inflation.  The Government cannot continue indefinitely to be a beneficiary in such circumstances.  The Minister's former colleague and former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, was of the view that the Government does not need the revenue from stamp duty.  Does he know something we do not, or does the Minister for Finance know something he is not telling us and which may prevent him from moving on this issue?  Has he divine inspiration or does he know anything at all?

In the United States, the detrimental effects of such circumstances have been labelled "nature deficit disorder".  It is increasingly the case in that society that children are deprived of both parents for the duration of every working day to such an extent that social difficulties arise when they reach their late teens.  It is not something we should laugh about, because there are indications that something similar is happening here.  Will the Minister bear in mind the serious problems that exist in terms of housing affordability and access, including the ability of people to move in either direction on the property ladder or to get on it in the first instance?I wonder when the word "unit" was appropriated for the housing market.  It apparently coincided with a marked decrease in the size of new homes and the space available to their unfortunate inhabitants.  One could embrace some of these newer "units" with both arms.

In my constituency of Dublin South-Central — in areas such as the inner city, Ballyfermot, Walkinstown, Crumlin and Drimnagh — average prices for a modest family home range from €300,000 to €400,000.  This is far below the haughty levels at which the houses of many of Deputy Barrett's constituents are valued.  In many areas of my constituency, however, a large proportion of the residents are elderly.  Some of these grey-haired, well quaffed senior citizens enjoy all the community facilities available in their localities, but they also miss the spirit of youth.Young people are unable to purchase homes close to their parents, grandparents and other family members.  The traditional extended family network persists to a greater degree in inner city areas than elsewhere.  While the nuclear family may be the norm in the suburbs, in the working class areas of Dublin that I represent people place great store in the support offered by a greater family network.  They are able to go to work because their children can be looked after by family members close by.  All of this will be facilitated by the legislation before us by enabling first-time buyers to purchase homes in the areas where their families have lived for generations.  That will be a great boost to community spirit in the aforementioned areas.  Deputy Burton represents an area comprising similar economic strata to mine.

I merely want to state that whereas there may have been a lack of confidence in previous months, the situation has changed significantly and the reports from the wholesale distributors of equipment and household goods are positive.  The increasing number of houses which are being started or completed this month as a result of definite knowledge about stamp duty is helping to restore economic confidence.As the Minister stated, we do not expect the same numbers of houses to be built in the future, but somewhere in the region of 60,000 will be built with confidence and will be sold, which will help to continue the type of economic growth this country has come to value.  It will continue to be a good country to live in, for children to be reared in and for first-time buyers to buy houses in without having to pay any stamp duty.

Nothing demonstrated that more clearly than Deputy Ardagh's contribution.  It really is a dialogue of the deaf here, although there is merit in some of the content of all the contributions.I accept the Minister's points that we must safeguard the Exchequer and that there is a demand for funding for a variety of public services.  However, we must put the want-to-be home owner centre stage in this debate.  Home ownership has been a long cherished ambition in society and it is now a dream for many people who, ten, 15 or 20 years ago, would never have been clients of local authorities for housing, be it social or affordable.  That is the issue that must be centre stage in this debate.  While there may be a cost to the Exchequer of yielding on some of the points raised, there is also a cost to society of not addressing this issue, which the Exchequer will end up bearing indirectly.  There will be a greater demand for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to build more social and affordable housing because people are put at such a financial disadvantage that they cannot afford to buy houses themselves.  It is a dialogue of the deaf.  It is fundamentally depressing.All the Minister needs to do is to yield on some of the issues raised, which have merit.  If there were a willingness to engage in serious debate, it would not be beyond the capacity of this House to come up with a solution that would address the problems of many want-to-be home owners for whom this Government is killing the dream.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	400	——or 4,000 people, if that is the estimate.  However, it is a very small and modest proposal in the context of the housing industry and the difficulties faced by many families.It restores certainty to the market, which will be reflected in some positive trends over the summer months.  However, it does nothing fundamental.  There is a serious issue facing the Minister as he prepares his next budget.  Whatever about the merits of the commission on taxation, he needs to make a serious economic statement in the early autumn giving his view on where the building industry is going.  The demand for mortgages in the first half of the year has dropped by 21%.  It peaked at over 30% last year.  The 21% drop in the demand for mortgages has nothing to do with the former Tánaiste's statements on stamp duty but has to do with rising interest rates.  Housing starts for the first part of the year run as follows.  In January, year on year, housing starts were down by 17%, in February they were down39%, in March they were down 23%, in April they were up 4% and in May they were down 43%.  The 12 month trend shows a drop from approximately 90,000 housing units last year to 60,000 units this year.  That is an astronomical drop.  However, the demand for social housing is not the same as financial demand.  The number of housing starts can drop significantly and, with it, take down the number of affordable and social houses that are statutorily required to be put in place by builders and developers.  At the same time, there is an increasing social demand for houses for those who simply cannot afford them.  Many builders have priced themselves out of the starter market.  With eight interest rate increases of 0.25% each over the past 18 months, and a forecast of three more to follow, affordability is now a major issue.The contention by many economists that the supply of houses has now met demand is not accurate.  The drop in the supply of houses to 60,000 will be close to the financial demand for houses.  It will be close to the number of people who can afford to purchase but beyond that there is a huge social demand for houses which will not be met.  The number of affordable and social houses being put in place by builders and developers is dropping in proportion to the total number of housing starts this year.  The Minister knows that the building and construction sector makes a huge, yet disproportionate, contribution to the wealth of the country and the Minister's revenue flow.  I think it is now €3.5 billion or €4 billion, but this measure will not reduce that very much.  The number of housing starts will significantly reduce the flow of VAT, income tax and PRSI into the Minister's coffers as soon as the autumn.  I wonder what the estimate by the Departments of Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is of how many people will not commence work this summer in the building industry after the builders' summer holidays.  I would be interested to know how many will not go back.There is also some mismatch in the infrastructural programme.  My information is that the National Roads Authority has not given out new contracts yet this year for structural work.  The Minister should beef up the national plan by investing heavily in the roll-out of infrastructural work to take up the obvious redundancies that will occur in the house building sector.  The Minister knows the issues as well and probably better than any of us, but it is time he produced a reasoned paper on trends early in the autumn.  In that way, when we come to debate the budget we will base our arguments on solid facts rather than anecdotal evidence or speculation.

I know that Deputies on the Government side of the House are sympathetic to this proposal.  I ask the Minister to implement it.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."This Bill is required to give effect to the decision by the Government to increase the maximum number of Ministers of State from 17 to 20.  As members will be aware, the number has remained unchanged since 1995, when section 1 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1995 increased the maximum from 15 to 17.It is appropriate to set before the House the reasons behind the Government's decision in this matter, which are similar to those set out by Deputy Ruairí Quinn when he moved the Bill to increase the numbers in 1995.The major consideration, as in 1995, is that of workloads.  In determining the number of Ministers of State to be appointed by the Government, the Taoiseach has taken account of the growing burdens on Ministers and Ministers of State as a result of the greater complexity of the policy agenda, the management pressures in giving political direction to extensive Government programmes and the increased engagement with stakeholders at all levels, both domestically and in Europe.  As a result, the Government has decided to increase the number of Ministers of State by three.  A Minister of State may receive delegated powers from a Minister of the Government in accordance with the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1977.It remains true, and is inevitable, that the business of Government has grown and continues to grow yearly in volume and complexity.  While this is probably true almost everywhere, there are obvious reasons for the increasing workload in Ireland.  Our population has increased significantly and continues to grow.  The economy has grown rapidly, providing us with the resources to deal with issues which in less affluent times we could not address as thoroughly as we might have wished, and generating demands for Government to allocate some of our new wealth to areas that previously could not be prioritised against competing demands.  Our economic growth has also produced needs of its own, for example, the need for improved infrastructure, public transport and investment in education, research and development if we are to retain our competitiveness.Many of the new challenges are cross-cutting issues which require cross-departmental responses.  For example, the increase in the number of people coming to live and work in Ireland over the past ten years is a welcome concomitant of the growth in our economy, job opportunities and social and public services, but it also presents real challenges in the provision of public services on a number of fronts.  For example, the provision of education services to the large number of newcomers requires the provision of physical and teaching resources and language support.These factors, and the ageing of our population, plus the increasing importance of lifelong education and the promotion of innovation in the educational and enterprise sectors are the background to the particular challenges for which the Government requires an increase in the cadre of Ministers of State.  Specific areas for increased focus and activity during the life of this Dáil encompass integration policy, lifelong learning, innovation, children, disability and older people.The management of the asylum-seeking process has perhaps tended to overshadow, especially in the media, the challenge of facilitating the effective integration of the greater number of immigrants settling in Ireland for the medium to long term.  Ireland is late on the scene as a major recipient of economic immigration.  Most of our previous experience has been in the opposite direction.  The immigration experience in other countries shows that the most important factor in avoiding socio-demographic problems is the effective integration of the immigrant groups with the indigenous population and with each other.  Where this has been mishandled or neglected, the long-term economic and social consequences have proved deleterious, even disastrous in some areas.We have the opportunity to avoid this potential downside by addressing the integration issue in a measured, focused and strategic fashion.  To this end, the Government has appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for integration policy.  It is envisaged that this Minister of State will draw on expertise from several Departments and State bodies which provide services in this area.  Integration issues, in so far as they affect all non-Irish nationals coming to the State, will come under this remit.  A major priority will be the development of a coherent national policy on integration which draws on global best practice, establishes what works best and is tailored to the needs of Irish society as well as the reasonable requirements of immigrants who are lawfully resident in the State.Another area of public policy, arising from demographic changes which the Government believes merits increased and intensified focus is the range of problems arising from the steadily increasing proportion of persons aged 65 and over in the population.  In 2006, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over was 11%.  By 2011, this is estimated to rise to 14.1% and to 20% by 2036.  This expansion must be planned for and the problems of particular relevance to this older group addressed.  These include matters relating to the development of services for older people, the development of palliative care services and the capacity and standards of nursing homes.As the programme for Government indicates, a central element will be involvement in the preparation of a new national positive ageing strategy.  The objectives identified in the programme for maximising the independence of older people and making it easier for them to stay in their own homes represent crucial challenges for our ageing population.  These are only some of the problems that fall to be addressed as the population of older people continues to increase, both in absolute and percentage terms, and which reinforce the need for extra assistance at Minister of State level.Public policy has become more complex as our society has grown and developed.  We are all aware of the need to tackle various policy issues, such as drugs etc., in a cross-departmental and more focused manner.  This has been a successful approach in the past, as I know from my own direct experience.  The increase in the number of Ministers of State will enable the Government to extend this approach to different areas.The additional Ministers of State will play an invaluable role in the delivery of our extensive programme for Government.  Accordingly, I commend this Bill to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19827	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	409	We are being asked today to approve three new Ministers of State, which will cost €4 million each over the lifetime of the Government.  That €12 million could buy 700,000 home help hours for the people the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has mentioned.  It could provide 23,000 extra families with medical cards and could make a real difference to people's lives.  However, we are being asked to forfeit all those opportunities and, instead, vote for these extra Ministers of State without any business case being presented as to why we should have them, any performance tests setting out what they are to achieve or any indication of the value for money to be derived from the new posts.No other business in the country would decide to spend €12 million of its own money, let alone taxpayers' money, without some firm indication that the money would yield something of value to the people paying for it.  The thought process behind the three new Ministers of State is the very same as that which saw us pay out €1.3 billion in benchmarking awards and receive virtually nothing in return.  It is soft option politics based on the notion that when we need to, we can dip into taxpayers' pockets and take some more from them because it is convenient.  That is not the type of politics that will meet the challenges we will face in the coming five years.We know the era of soft money is at an end, as the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance has spent the past two hours telling the House while we debated other issues.  Within minutes of the Minister telling the House how frugal we must be with taxpayers' money and, accordingly, not offering any concessions in the area of stamp duty, a Minister of State in the same Department comes into the House and, without offering any significant business case, tells Members we must shell out money for three new Ministers of State.I have no objection to the lucky €4 million-men this legislation will create.  I am sure many are of estimable character.  In reality, we are being asked to allocate money which is scarce for other purposes.  A justifiable case needs to be made but the Minister of State opposite has not done so.The reason we have this type of politics goes back to the attitude the Taoiseach has taken.  He refuses to set standards, either for himself or his Ministers, and that is a core issue.  Politics must command respect because it sets standards for those who assume high office.  I do not pretend to believe standards of personal propriety have not been damaged by this Taoiseach.  I abhor the notion that it should be acceptable that a Minister for Finance would allow a "dig out" to be organised on his behalf when speaking in his capacity as a sovereign minister of a government.  That is wrong.  The Bill to outlaw that practice has not yet surfaced.  I hope it will be returned to the Order Paper quickly.  It was not passed, despite the promise that it would be passed in the last Oireachtas.This same "dig out" culture is still very evident.  Only last week we saw it clearly in the appointment of people to chair and manage important State bodies.  This is not the sort of culture we want.  We cannot afford to appoint people on the basis of their past loyalty when deciding who occupies important positions in State bodies.  I am not naive enough to think that people who have a Fianna Fáil background should not be appointed to these bodies, but I do not accept that persons who bring no proven skills or aptitude to the task they are undertaking should be appointed because they support Fianna Fáil.  That is unacceptable, but that standard continues to prevail and we have seen it since the election.The issue of standards goes much deeper.  It is about performance and setting important standards of performance for Ministers and Ministers of State.  We are being asked to approve three more Ministers of State without any standards of performance being applied to the existing Ministers.  We need to ensure that public procedures are applied to protect the tax payer, but that is not happening.  We need to see standards on delivering pledges made solemnly to the public, but that is not happening.  What about the solemn pledges made on class sizes?  What about the solemn pledges on the number of people on hospital waiting lists?  What about the pledges on the number of social and affordable houses that would be delivered?  All of these promises were breached and no Minister took any responsibility for them.  What about the failure of evaluation procedures — designed by the Department of Finance — to protect the tax payer when decisions are being made?  The Department of the Taoiseach tore up those procedures when trying to develop Stadium Ireland.  Those procedures were also torn up with the failure of e-voting, MediaLab Europe, the Punchestown equestrian centre and so on.  These projects were prominently promoted by Ministers who destroyed the evaluation procedures that were there to protect the tax payer.  There was no consequence when these projects failed and cost the tax payer millions of euros.  The Ministers who were involved were either promoted or left in their position.These are the issues at stake when we see new people being given the nod.  We have seen the virtual collapse of major public policies, but no Minister has suffered the consequences.  At the end of the period when decentralisation was to be completed, less than 10% of it was implemented.  Ministers hide their personal responsibility for this behind an implementation group which has been given an impossible task, because its political masters have not thought out the implications of what is to be done about it.  The climate change strategy was published in 2000.  By 2007, it had not achieved one whit of what it had set as a target, yet no Minister took responsibility.When we expect the tax payer to pony up to fund Ministers and new Ministers of State, we must see Ministers take responsibility.  Even a Minister who would not read his brief — and it cost the tax payer millions of euro — has not been sanctioned and he continues to operate within the Cabinet.  No tests of performance are being offered today for these Ministers of State.  If a system exists where performance is not at the core of promotion and of holding posts, then the capacity of an organisation to deliver is dumbed down.  Efficiency is undermined, as is the value of high performance.  That is what has happened.  Posts are being filled on the basis of loyalty and endurance, rather than on the basis of merit and performance.  That is not acceptable.  This Bill is designed to quell unrest among Fianna Fáil backbenchers who rightly see a congested and unfair system of promotion, where an existing plutocracy bars the way for new talent within that party.I take with a grain of salt this argument about greater complexity and the need to manage new volumes of business.  New challenges always arise.  That is the nature of politics.  One will always face new challenges, just as there is always a case for new programmes.  What we have learned the hard way in the past is that if there are new priorities, other matters must take the back seat.  When one decides on priorities one makes something a posteriority — something that has lower value.  That is what Governments must do.  That is what Taoisigh must do.  They must set priorities, decide what is important.  When the new demand arises one finds space elsewhere to accommodate it, but that is not the way this is being approached.I do not dispute that there are new tasks to be addressed.  I do not deny that there is a strong case for an innovation strategy, for example, but is there still a case for having separate departments for fisheries, for forestry and for horticulture, and a senior Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  I doubt there is still a case for having a separate Minister for food and for food safety?  I doubt there is a case for having a separate Minister for integration and for equality?We need a proper debate if we are to give this the nod, but such a debate will not occur.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has come in with no such brief.  There is no policy agenda to be pursued under these headings.  There are no performance tests by which we might be able to judge in a year's time or two years' time whether these new Ministers of State were justified.  That is not an acceptable way to play free and loose with taxpayers' money, and it is part of a culture that must change.  I am disappointed that the Department of Finance, of all Departments, comes in here to rubber-stamp this sort of shoddy approach to public business.The truth is it was not a concern about new areas that led to this allocation.  If we were discussing meeting the challenge of innovation, we would look on the Fianna Fáil benches for someone who had skill and aptitude to address a task like this.  While I know many members in Fianna Fáil, I would have said Deputy Sean Ardagh is an ideal person to occupy that position.  He is a professional accountant.  His family has been involved in innovation within business.  He has a perfect identikit to bring value to this post.  I have no objection to the person who has been given the post, but genuinely looking around on the backbenches for persons who would bring skill is not the test and we do not see such a test being applied in the way these positions are being doled out.  That is what is deeply disturbing about what is happening here.  Jobs are being chucked out because it is politically expedient to do so and that is not a fair or correct reason for doing it.It has been said that the successful politician is one who will promise a bridge, even where there is no river.  I suppose the Taoiseach is building three such bridges today.  People will take off stating that he is the cute operator, and he probably is.  He is probably correct in making the calculation that by the time the people come to vote again they will have forgotten about this cavalier attitude.They also will have forgotten about the cavalier attitude that agreements which they negotiate with Independent Deputies to support the Government should not be revealed, which is also a clear breach of any decent standard of accountability.  The voters will have forgotten, where a particular Deputy was in the courts contesting a law and had a deal to negotiate with RTE about the money she owed, that the Taoiseach had come out in the midst of those sensitive negotiations stating that this was a Deputy who ought to be in Government.  If that is not interfering with the independence and due process of matters that are being dealt with elsewhere, I do not know what is.These are cavalier abuses of the high trust that people have in this Government and they should not happen.  They should not happen at the beginning of Government because the Government is confident that people will have forgotten about them by the time it is all over.  If we ourselves do not have standards, and believe that we must apply and honour high standards, people will take us for what they see.  By this decision and by many of the decisions that have been taken in the past two weeks, we are undermining the trust we want to see people have in their politicians.  It is time to get away from soft option politics.  If the Minister of State were genuine, he would say that new Ministers of State were needed and he would provide strategy approaches and performance tests to judge them.  That would be great but this Taoiseach does not have the authority to do so because he has allowed shoddy standards to apply in the past without sanction.  That has undermined the important accountability of Ministers to Government and of Government to this House.I will not ask the taxpayers to stump up €4 million for each of these three Ministers of State.  I do not see the case for it and I do not accept it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I read the Taoiseach's announcement yesterday about the gallery of Ministers of State.  On a personal basis everyone is pleased for the Members and their families.  It is a signal honour to be asked to serve in Government as a Minister or Minister of State.  We wish them well.The Department of Education and Science has five Ministers of State and one Minister.  The Department of Health has four Ministers of State and one Minister.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform kicks in with another four Ministers of State and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has another four Ministers of State.  I do not know if the Taoiseach was having a laugh when he provided the Department of Education and Science with five Ministers of State.  What is the Secretary General to do — order an extra large conference table for the ministerial meeting room?  The Minister and the Ministers of State all have advisers, press attachés and personnel to hold their hand and carry out ministerial duties.Deputy Bruton referred to sound management principles in respect of Departments.  Many have management meetings to which the Secretary General and various assistant secretaries are invited.  In most Departments this runs to at least six or seven people.  In the Department of Health and Children there is one Minister, her senior advisers, a Secretary General, five Ministers of State with one adviser each, and the assistant secretaries.  Is this additional work for the Office of Public Works?  Was this a clever ruse by the brother of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to invest in new, state-of-the-art, Irish designed ministerial furniture for all the posteriors that will occupy places around departmental conference tables?  It is unbelievable.One could draw a matrix of this.  The Minister with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith, is a super junior but the super man is Deputy Jimmy Devins.  He is the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In fairy tales, when a prince or princess is born, they are given a series of titles.  When Deputy Devins is introduced at some grand state function at the UN, in some marbled hall or perhaps when he meets the King and Queen of Belgium, and the major-domo holds out his staff and stamps for attention, will he read out the full and mellifluous titles to be enjoyed by this proposed Minister of State?  It is a cod.  His responsibilities are spread across four Departments with special responsibility for disability issues and mental health (excluding discrimination).  This reads like a treaty of some kind.  I presume when the Green Party was negotiating with Fianna Fáil, the brackets were square ones but subsequently when the deal was done they were converted to round brackets.  That is the way it is done in international diplomacy at the UN and in various other such organisations.One of the first jobs of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, will be major orders of furniture and fittings for the offices of the new Ministers of State.  All of them will require nice curtains, carpets and so on.  We need to establish whether they will have an office, however modest, in each of the Ministries to which they have been allocated.  That was the tradition where Ministers of State had multiple functions.  They usually had a home Department in which they had their primary base.My second question, which is a serious one, relates to what will be the designated functions of these Ministers of State.  As someone who has served as a Minister of State, I expect any civil servant or Secretary General worth his or her salt would tell any Minister of State that unless he or she has designated functions, he or she will have office but no power.  In the previous Government, perhaps because it was its second term in office, there was a growing tendency for Ministers of State to have no designated functions.  At that time the Ministry of State with the largest budget, namely, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, had little in the way of designated functions.  Given that we are now spending in excess of €500 million and we are all committed to increasing it, I note the senior Minister began to move back to exercising his right to be in command of overseas development assistance.A number of Ministers of State on the list before me have real jobs, including the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Ahern, who is present.  I congratulate him.  As Members are aware, being Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW is one of the plum jobs of Government.  It is probably one of the best possible Minister of State positions.  In effect, he has a budget and a range of interesting responsibilities.  Given his experience and connections, I am sure he will have designated responsibilities.  He will make sure of that.Let us examine some of the proposed appointments.  Deputy Pat Carey has been assigned some direct responsibilities, such as for the drugs strategy and community affairs.  That is an important job.  However, what are we to make of the responsibilities of the poor Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan?  He is to be Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with special responsibility for integration policy.  One who is Minister of State in three or four Departments is Minister of State for everything and nothing because one has no budget line and, by and large, one has no delegated functions.  This brings Members back to the issue whether the Taoiseach is acting with supreme political cynicism by filling offices.  To keep happy the parties that compose the Government, a plethora of Ministers of State exist with little thought given to how they will do their jobs.I revert to the Department of Education and State which has five Ministers of State.  One of the key areas in this regard concerns the development of a national preschool education system to give all children an opportunity to go to preschool.  However, preschool education is not mentioned in the list of responsibilities of the five Ministers of State.  Another important educational issue pertains to having a Minister of State with responsibility for universities because in investment terms, as far as continuing our economy's growth is concerned, it is education, education, education.While we have good primary and second level systems, we must expand into a preschool system for disadvantaged children in particular.  We must give them an opportunity to get involved in preschool, thereby giving them a flying start in life.  At third level, the universities and institutes of technology are critical to our economic future by supplying graduates in fields such as information technology, in which there is a huge shortage, business, in which the numbers applying for degrees are falling and, in particular, in mathematics and science.  There is a serious shortage of candidates who are interested in mathematics and the sciences, and all Members are aware that these are critical areas for our future.In recent years, Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and others have done good work by putting more money into science and technology at third level.  However, no Minister of State is responsible for this issue and it is not even mentioned.  There is something called innovation policy, which constitutes a Civil Service fudge by the permanent government.  Presumably the Department of Education and Science did not wish to hand over a directly stated designated responsibility for the universities, the institutes of technology and higher education in general.  Instead it came up with this entity which is to straddle the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Science and which has no title other than innovation policy.  It is a case of adding a little bit of this to a little bit of that, putting in a little bit of salt and pepper, stirring the mix and hoping that something will emerge.  In the context of this economy's present status and future development needs, I am surprised and disappointed that the Taoiseach copped out to the permanent government in this regard.I understand the establishment cost of each Minister of State, excluding their salaries and so on, is €450,000 per year according to answers supplied last year to my colleague, Deputy Eamon Gilmore.  I would not begrudge this money to the present cast of 20 were they to have serious defined responsibilities in respect of some critical areas.  I feel sorry for some of the individuals in question because they will be running from one Department to another having interviews with Secretaries General, they will have no designated functions and they will comprise a hodge-podge.  In some cases, they will be distributing cheques and funds to community organisations, but that will not help our economy in terms of the challenges we will face.  I am sorry the Government has missed the boat this time.

I can think of no more suitable a person.It is a great honour and responsibility to be elected to Dáil Éireann to represent the people of Tipperary South with my party colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, and Deputy Tom Hayes of Fine Gael.The legislation to expand the number of Ministers of State to 20 accompanies the formation of a third Administration under the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, an extraordinary political achievement without parallel since the days of Éamon de Valera.  Some allege that the continued dominance of Fianna Fáil is harmful to democracy, but elections were always hard fought and there was not the slightest advance certainty about the outcome of the recent election.We have heard much about performance criteria, business tests and so on from Deputy Bruton.  Ireland is regarded at home and abroad as a high-performing country whether one examines economic performance, progress in terms of increased incomes and development or the success of the peace process.  These cannot be measured by a cost benefit analysis of particular Ministers or Ministers of State, nor was such done previously.  Those in Gordon Brown's Britain — it is no longer Tony Blair's — are fond of benchmarking everything, but it can create a great deal of extra bureaucracy that costs money.Nostalgia has been expressed in the press for more austere days when there was only a handful of parliamentary secretaries, but let it be remembered that the last rainbow coalition increased the number of Ministers of State to 17, including an extra super junior who could attend Cabinet meetings.  From 1992 to 1997, there was a separate Department under the Tánaiste.  Upon entering the rainbow Government, one Minister appointed five special advisers immediately.  It is all very well to talk about dipping into the pot, soft options and so on, but will Deputy Bruton explain the qualitative and moral difference between what occurred in 1994 and 1995 and what is being done now?The increasing responsibilities, the new problems and complexities of decision making and the need for better cross-departmental co-ordination have contributed to the legislation to appoint three extra Ministers of State, which smooths the passage of a novel and exciting coalition arrangement involving the Green Party for the first time.Deputy Burton expressed criticism about Ministers of State being attached to several Departments.  I do not know what her experience is, but my own is that attention to problems that are at the edge of one Department's responsibilities, and perhaps marginally eligible for the attention of another Department, may fall through the cracks.  It is necessary to have people who can pull together those with different responsibilities and from different Departments to address problems.  I do not see the same problem that Deputy Burton does in somebody being attached to more than one or even several Departments.For example, our ageing population and the integration of the immigrant population, the new Irish as they are called, are important issues requiring special attention as they are problems that are increasing.  As people live longer, the proportion of the population that is ageing is on the increase.  There are predictions that we will soon be in a situation where 10% of our population will have been born outside Ireland.  We are all aware of the language problems involved in this and the potential threats to social stability in the event of a serious downturn in the economy which, however, I do not foresee.In many governments throughout the world, Ministers of State, Secretaries of State, Under-Secretaries, or whatever title may be used, are attached to each cabinet member.  That we will have 20 at the second level attached to the 15 Cabinet members under the Constitution is neither disproportionate nor unusual.  A picture has been painted of four Ministers of State attached to a particular Minister and five attached to another.  In many cases, however, each Minister of State may be attached to several Departments.  It is my understanding that no single Minister will have four or five full-time Ministers of State.Those who depict a bloated Government leave out of account that Irish people value the accessibility of their political decision makers and their ability to contact and encounter them personally.  The representative dimension of officeholders also includes representation to the media, the demands of which are forever increasing.In the brief time I have been in this House, I have found that the word "cynical" is undoubtedly the one most overused.  It features practically in every other breath in Opposition speeches.  I suppose it is us they are accusing of being cynical rather than they being cynics themselves.  In focusing on this legislation, we should not succumb to the cynical view that only the holding of office counts.  Being an elected parliamentarian, together with exercising the duties of a public representative, is important and valuable in its own right.  In many countries and multinational organisations where there is a clearer separation of powers, officeholders cannot remain members of parliament.  This is the case in the United States, France and the European Parliament, for example.I warmly congratulate all who have been appointed to this Government, especially the three new Ministers of State whose offices are created by this Bill.  I congratulate my fellow countywoman, Deputy Hoctor, on being granted an important responsibility for older people.  I look forward to continuing active cross-border co-operation with her, especially given the overlap of constituency and county council borders from Annacarty to Killenaule.  The two Government Deputies in Tipperary South, like party colleagues in a similar situation in six other three-seater constituencies, will have to work hard, without relying on the advantages of ministerial office or an independent arrangement, to ensure the same level of Government assistance is delivered to our constituents.  It can be done.  Earlier this year, for instance, sports capital grants to County Tipperary in its entirety doubled, notwithstanding the absence of officeholders in either constituency at that time.  I offer my support to the entire Government team which will be enhanced and completed by this Bill.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I agree with everything my colleague, Deputy Bruton, said in this debate and I will try to avoid repeating some of his comments, although I may be tempted to stray into some of the issues he raised.  I also found Deputy Burton's contribution to be especially interesting.  She is correct in the context of one or two Departments in which it appears that Ministers of State will be tripping over each other to find relevant work.  However, I do not wish to be churlish because I regard it a great honour to be re-elected to this House, so I wish all those appointed as Ministers of State well and hope they will find relevant work.  However, the track record for Ministers of State has tended to be that five or six have real jobs while the remainder have notional duties.It was not that long ago when legislation provided for only ten Ministers of State, a figure since increased to 15, 17 and now the 20 provided for in this Bill.  According to my theory on the matter, there are two reasons for the increase in the numbers of Ministers of State.  The first is the simple political reality of senior Ministers who retain their positions in Government, Fianna Fáil Members on the backbenches for too long, and Fianna Fáil Taoisigh feeling the need to keep Members under some degree of control and preserve a certain level of personal happiness while also ensuring they retain their sanity.  The only means of achieving those aims is by increasing the prospects for Deputies of being appointed Minister of State.  With each new intake of Deputies, the number of Ministers of State has increased in an environment of limited reshuffling of Ministers.The problem is a fundamental one.  I was interested to hear Deputy Mansergh's comments as a new Member of this House.  He raised a matter of importance which is missing from the manner by which the Dáil operates when he referred to the fact that simply being a Member of Parliament offers a meaningful and important role and should allow a meaningful contribution to the legislative process.  That is the nub of the problem because, if we leave aside the need to appoint Ministers and some Ministers of State to ensure a functioning Government and the political reasons for appointing extras who have no serious jobs to perform, the second reason for such appointments is because this Parliament requires root and branch reform.It is interesting to return here after an absence of five years and discover that no meaningful reforms have been made to parliamentary procedures.  The committees which were created by the previous Dáil have had a limited impact on the workings of Government and the provision of policy.  The real difficulty for Deputies who want to do work other than simple constituency services while also ensuring their re-election is that non-ministerial Members perform no meaningful legislative function of any nature whatsoever.  The present Government, which has been in office for the past ten years and could have its remit extended a further five years, has done everything it can to ensure Deputies on the backbenches of the Government and the Opposition sides of the House play as meaningless a legislative role as possible.  I say that as someone who has published 25 Private Member's Bills and was fortunate enough to manage, in circumstances where governments had limited majorities, to pass four of them.  The remaining 19 Bills, while ultimately defeated by the Government, resulted in very similar Government legislation within two to three years.There is a need to reform the way this House operates and this Government has a unique opportunity to do so.  Perhaps if this House operated differently and if Members who are not members of Government were allowed to play a real legislative role, there would not be a need for us to continue to grow what are largely meaningless positions of Ministers of State, to give people titles so they feel better about what they are doing, while giving them no meaningful functions at all.I wish to highlight an issue I discovered through research I carried out in the few weeks since the general election.  I have discovered the extraordinary statistic that in the 29th Dáil, a total of 70 Private Member's Bills were published, all of them by Opposition Deputies.  Indeed, the Leas Ceann Comhairle himself published some of those Bills.  In any normal parliament, given the broad range of issues with which those Bills dealt, a reasonable number over a five-year period would have been enacted.  The Bills covered a broad range of issues, some of which were of great importance but were not given priority by the Government.  Many of them dealt with issues that should not have embarrassed the Minister of the day.The Government should have welcomed constructive proposals coming from the Opposition side.  Instead, the Government has a knee-jerk, negative reaction to Private Member's Bills published.  Ministers feel that, rather than being worthy measures that should be encouraged, they in some way diminish the stature of the Minister and undermine his or her legislative potency in the eyes of the public.  Of the 70 Private Member's Bills published, only one was enacted.  That was a Bill published by Deputy Rabbitte, making an important but minor amendment to the coroners legislation.  The Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2005 was eventually enacted in December 2005.  A total of 70 Private Member's Bills were published but only one was enacted.The way this Parliament operates is fundamentally wrong.  This Government should, in the context of retaining and preserving the sanity of its own backbenchers and allowing this House to play a meaningful role, make a policy decision that it welcomes constructive legislation published by Members from all sides of the House.  If legislation is published by a Fianna Fáil backbencher, it should not been seen as treachery and an attempt to embarrass the Minister.  If legislation is published by an Opposition Deputy, the merits of that legislation should be considered.  It should not simply be allowed a first reading and then either squashed on Second Stage or put into a vacuum in a committee that never progresses it.  Specific time should be made available in this House to allow Private Member's legislation a degree of priority to progress various issues.We must ensure on Committee Stages, particularly in committees, that Ministers welcome constructive amendments proposed by Opposition Deputies and do not always perceive them as being a political trap.  We should no longer go through the charade of voting down amendments from the Opposition, only for the Minister, on Report Stage, to produce an identical amendment in order to say the legislation is his or hers and the Opposition played no hand or part in it.

There is no more glaring example of the price that will be paid for the infection of Fianna Fáil by a PD proposal to build private, for-profit hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals.  The Taoiseach, who has now taken on this proposal as if it were his own, stands exposed in another respect.  I have witnessed his so-called campaign for citizenship around the country, which in reality is an appeal for volunteering.  There is nothing wrong with volunteering, which is a good thing, but it is not a campaign for citizenship.  Missing from the Taoiseach's campaign is any hint of those egalitarian values that might be at the basis of genuine republicanism.  This shows in a whole series of ways.  It shows also how the public capital programme can be held back to make room for the most vicious kind of private accumulation.  That is clear to anyone who has visited the University Hospital in Galway, known as the regional hospital, where there is an effective plan.  If that plan was implemented, it would immediately yield up 150 beds.  That plan relies on public capital investment, which will be withheld to facilitate the racket of private, for-profit hospital proposals.Consultants are happy to work with their great professional gifts and training.  The Minister for Health and Children's invitation for them to become involved in a new contract was minimally about their work and conditions.  The majority of the contract's pages were about the opportunities in the new private racket to build on public hospital grounds.  The Government is withholding public capital moneys from good projects in public hospitals to facilitate a private racket, in exactly the same way as with the 14.5 acre site in the centre of Galway city.  Not one penny of public money will participate in a €1 billion development because it will sell off the greater proportion of the site for 800 apartments.  The Government is withholding public investment to allow the private racket in.All around the country, water systems require management and testing facilities.  Instead of local authority projects being accepted, however, they are held back to facilitate build, design and operate projects from the private sector.  It is profoundly ideological but deadly also.  Those with whom the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children have chosen to do business are people whose intellectual, corporate and moral history in the United States is something of which anybody would be ashamed.  It is interesting that the HSE, in forcing itself to provide a half honest answer, said that those bidding for contracts are not currently involved in any investigation.  It would have been interesting if they had looked at the intellectual, corporate and moral history of those with whom they are dealing.  The evidence from such corporations includes having been sued by patients and insurers, investigated by the FBI, and having done incredible deals to literally stay out of jail as a result of their practices.  In 2001 the health care corporation formerly known as Columbia HCA, the largest for-profit hospital chain in the United States, agreed to plead guilty to criminal conduct relating to five areas of medicare and medicaid fraud and paid over $840 million in criminal fines and civil penalties to the federal government and the affected states.Can the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Health Service Executive say that those with whom they are dealing have a clean history regarding fraud?  I do not believe they can and this is why we are not receiving answers to fundamental questions.Any definition of a caring health system in a republic would involve a unified hospital system providing universal access based on medical need, not income.  This is the kind of system we can now afford to have, given Government revenues, but instead we are inviting the commodification of health.  We are inviting an ethos and ideological drive that sees not a health care system but a sickness industry.  Similar companies have attended bank-sponsored promotional meetings in Dublin and have suggested in Britain that, ideally, the state, in addition to providing incentives allowing them to exist, should guarantee a certain number of patients.  As was said at the conference in Dublin, the great thing is that if the system does not ultimately make money the State can buy back the contract after a period of years.  The companies may get paid whether or not patients turn up.This is a disgraceful abuse of public space in Ireland that abandons public land owned by the Irish people and delays the public capital programme that could deliver a first-class health care system.  This policy discards all values of citizenship and equality and splits the health service.  One principled consultant, Dr. John Barton, has resigned because of his objection to this racket that compromises the professional integrity of consultants.  Consultants are being invited to agree to the new contract and in return participate in the racket taking place on hospital grounds.In the United States 16% of income is spent on health care, 43 million people are without health cover and, on average, insurance premiums cost three times more than in Ireland.  A limited service is provided that is bloated by fraudulent and excessive costs that raise premiums and this is what is being created on Irish hospital grounds.Studies have been done of private, for-profit hospitals and we should unemotionally examine what should be the test of a health system.  Are these hospitals better for patients?  Are they safer?  Do they provide excellence?  In every journal in the United States that has examined private, for-profit hospitals and public hospitals under these criteria, public hospitals have emerged as better.How is this model of health care to be imposed?  It is to be imposed through a refusal to spend money in the capital programme and in plans in the Department of Health.  The greatest blackmail of all is to suggest no extra beds can be provided except through the co-location of hospitals.  This pathetic blackmail has been forced on Tallaght Hospital but luckily there are other locations in the country where medicine means more than this, where professionals will choose to work in a way in which their vocation suggests is for the benefit of all citizens.  Everyone who has examined the Irish health service, including Marie O'Connor, Risteard Mulcahy and Maeve Ann Wren, has suggested it needs reform but not a private, unaccountable racket on public hospital grounds.  They object to the tap of badly needed capital funds being turned off, though those funds are available to give us the health service we need.When all the Taoiseach's posturing and commemorations are over he should note that it is a shabby version of a state and certainly nothing that could be called a republic that decides to go down this road.  In public transport, health and the maintenance of public water supplies it is always the same, the Taoiseach bends his knee to the ideological poison that is the influence of the Progressive Democrats in Cabinet and which was rejected comprehensively by the people.  There is no public mandate for the Minister's policy, which is bad for medicine, the Republic and the State and will take generations to undo.  For these reasons, it should be opposed by Fianna Fáil backbench Deputies who know very well that what I say is true.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I wish to share time with Deputies O'Connor, Ó Fearghaíl, Fleming, McDaid and Moloney.I congratulate Deputy Howlin on his election to the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  From working with him on committees, I know he will do a fine job.  I also congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on her re-appointment.Having spoken on a number of health motions during the 29th Dáil, I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion.  The Minister and her Ministers of State in the previous Dáil are to be commended for the efforts they made in a difficult portfolio.  Throughout her term of office in the previous Government, the Minister secured increased funding for the health budget.  I hope that Government's policy of trying to ensure taxpayers got value for money will continue to be the cornerstone of the Minister's stewardship of the Department of Health and Children.In recent years, I have seen the value for money we get in keeping patients in publicly funded hospitals.  If we could shift expenditure towards providing care in the home where patients would prefer to be, we would get much better value for money.  The Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, local authorities and the Health Service Executive have done a great deal of work in this area and provide many supports, including home helps and disabled person's grants.  The Alzheimer Society of Ireland has a programme in place offering assistance to families who look after a relative at home.  We should provide more supports to the general practitioner service to ensure families are able to care for patients at home.I support the co-location principle.  One of last night's speakers stated that under co-location private patients will turn right and public patients will turn left when they enter a hospital campus.  This is already the case as many regional and general hospitals have separate wards for public and private patients.  The proposals, therefore, will not make a great difference in that respect.I am pleased the Green Party now supports the Government's efforts to bring about co-location, which is already a feature in a number of public hospital campuses, including the Mater Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin.  Apart from providing up to 1,000 additional beds for public patients over the next five years, the initiative will encourage the participation of the private sector in generating additional capacity for patients, maximise the potential use of public hospital sites, which would be a welcome development, promote efficiency among public and private acute service providers and foster greater competition in the supply of hospital services.The Health Service Executive will have a hands-on input in the roll-out of the co-location programme, which will be reviewed in several years.  I support the co-location policy and wish the Minister every success with it.

If the Minister prefers, I can talk about my wishes for my local hospital, but she knows all those so I do not need to do so.With regard to the motion, it is good that we have the opportunity to discuss these issues.  We traditionally compliment parties in this regard although this motion is more politically motivated than most.  It is not for me to tell Fine Gael how to look after its Private Members' business but it does not seem able to count and it certainly does not seem to understand the result of the last election.  When I spoke in April last, Deputy Enda Kenny took the view that after the election he would be on this side of the House and I would be home in Tallaght tending my garden, but he is still on the other side of the House and I am back here.  The people have made their decision.In this debate we hear all kinds of views as to what the people decided.  The people returned many colleagues and if one considers the result in Dublin South-West, one has to interpret what the people were thinking, and two Fianna Fáil Deputies from that constituency are still in the House.In July 2005 the Minster announced an initiative to have co-located private hospitals built on the campuses of public hospitals.  The aim of that initiative is to enable up to 1,000 beds in public hospitals which are currently used by private patients to be redesignated for use by public patients.  Co-location is already a feature on a number of public hospital campuses, such as the Mater and St. Vincent's.There has been much talk of Tallaght in the past couple of days.  I am always happy to mention Tallaght but I am on comfortable ground today as a number of colleagues have already done so.  I do not usually pay much attention to what newspapers tell me, but The Irish Mail on Sunday recently stated “Hospital reform is a healthy move”.  It stated that the decision on Saturday:... by the board of Tallaght Hospital to embrace Health Minister Mary Harney's co-location policy is both a welcome and a courageous one.  There can be no doubt that Tallaght's previously expressed reservations about the policy, founded as they were on the ethos of the old city-centre voluntary hospitals, were sincere and deeply held.  But times change.The article continued:... over many years, the famous city-centre hospitals which merged to form Tallaght, the Adelaide and the Meath, had no difficulty in providing, on the same site, private treatment for their wealthier patients, and free treatment for others, including the poorest of the city poor.I will continue through this Dáil term to regularly raise issues relating to the health services and Tallaght Hospital.  The Minister will get different views from across the House but there is positive as well as negative reaction in Tallaght.  It is very important that we understand that there is much to be done in Tallaght, and I support that.I take the opportunity to remind the Minister that it is the aspiration of Tallaght Hospital to develop a landmark building on the current site.  I understand the building will include vitally necessary administrative space and crucially required outpatient clinic services.  With other issues, I hope we will continue to have the Minister's support for Tallaght Hospital.

It is welcome to return to the House following the general election, during which, as we knocked on doors in our various constituencies, health featured as a particularly prominent issue with the electorate — it certainly did so in Kildare South, as I am sure it did in many other constituencies.It is appropriate that one of the first issues we get to address on Private Members' time is health related.  However, I must join my colleague Deputy Charlie O'Connor in chiding the Fine Gael Party on bringing forward the motion in this format at this time.  I suspect he is right in saying that what Fine Gael is about is an attempt to embarrass the Green Party, our new partners in Government.  Rather than attempt to embarrass the Green Party, Fine Gael should, perhaps, look to it for guidance on how to be a constructive Opposition party.  Over the course of the past five years in the House, I was conscious of the number of occasions on which the Green Party used its Private Members' time to bring forward constructive legislative proposals.  Perhaps if Fine Gael had adopted a more positive approach during the past five years and the general election, it would not find itself languishing on the Opposition benches.  It is clear from the motion that Fine Gael has learned no lessons.  After finding itself on the Opposition benches six elections in a row, the Fine Gael motto now appears to be "If it is broke, don't fix it".Fine Gael used to have some interesting points to make on health.  This was before it signed up to the bogus Labour Party accusation, as enunciated trenchantly and vehemently by Deputy Michael D. Higgins, that the Government is privatising the health service.  On 4 May 2004 the Fine Gael health spokesman said: "It is only with the introduction of competition that we can capture for patients the benefits of the market".  He went on to say:I do not expect that this will happen overnight or indeed that competition and private provision is the solution to all healthcare provision, but I believe it is in the direction in which we must go.However, this evening Fine Gael asserts that moving 1,000 private beds from public hospitals is privatisation.I support the amendment to the motion and Government policy as enunciated by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, who has been an outstanding Minister in this area.  Its central objective remains the freeing of publicly funded beds for public patients.  The co-location initiative will achieve 1,000 new public beds quickly and more cost effectively, ensuring better access to acute hospital services for public patients.  I heard this demand from constituents throughout County Kildare over the past weeks and months.  We want to achieve a situation where there is no two-tier entry into publicly funded hospitals, as has been the case for many years.  We do not want to continue the current system forever, under which public hospitals and consultants are paid more for private patients than public patients for treatment in our tax-funded public hospitals.  It is not privatisation to free beds for all patients, public and private.  Nor is it privatisation to ask the private sector to finance and manage private beds and private hospital services.Private or independent hospitals here are not new.  Indeed, it seems Fine Gael supports them as long as they are not on the same site as public hospitals.  Private care has always been an integral part of our health care services and is not confined to one service or a group of people in one locality.  The Mater Private, St. Vincent's Private Hospital, the Blackrock Clinic, the Bon Secours group and, in my constituency, Clane General Hospital have been embedded and accepted in health care provision for many years.  I reject the suggestion, so eloquently but so mistakenly put forward by Deputy Michael D. Higgins, that this represents some form of racket.  I assure him that people who choose to avail of the services in those hospitals do not consider themselves as participating in a racket.

As long as medical research continues around the world, there will be waiting lists as international medical practitioners attempt and succeed in medical and surgical procedures only dreamt of previously.  One of the greatest breakthroughs happened over 50 years ago in South Africa with the first heart transplant.  If that procedure was carried out today in the same manner, it would be regarded as quite cumbersome.  Even in this country we are performing liver transplants, heart transplants, lung transplants and heart and lung transplants, procedures we only dreamed of performing ten years ago.  These procedures have become a way of life but, unfortunately, as I speak people are awaiting transplants.That is why I look forward to the advent of stem cells because the future of medicine lies in the pursuit of research in this area.  I hope we debate this subject in the House soon.  Waiting lists will only become extinct the day that medical research stops.  In too many cases, however, waiting lists are unacceptable.  The high-tech issues I mentioned earlier are directly related.  If we are to proceed in this area, space must be created.  Given the huge steps taken over recent decades, the waiting lists are more a sign of our progress than of our deficiencies.I fully accept that the co-location of hospitals is essential.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is the only available comparator and initially I wondered how it would work.  The fund, however, has dealt with 171 of my patients.  If one asked any of them did they mind whether they were treated in a private or public hospital they would say no.  The pain they had suffered for years was gone and they now had a better quality of life.  The ultimate aim of us all, especially those working in the health service, is surely to expedite the journey of the patient through the system so that he or she can have quality of life again.The co-location policy must answer two questions: will it provide more beds more quickly than any other method and will it represent value for money?  During its election campaign, the Fine Gael Party promised 2,500 beds for which the money was available through the national development plan.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	430	Actually the number was 2,300.

In other words, a bed-only policy means that it planned to curtail the onward march of medicine in other fields.Is value for money as important in this area, where people are already diagnosed and awaiting operations so they can be pain free and resume a quality life with their families?  I would support such a situation in the north west where we are still asking cancer patients to travel to Belfast, Dublin and Galway for radiation treatment at a time when they are most vulnerable.  They spend weeks away from their families.This was brought home to me last Friday night at the midsummer ball in Letterkenny where one of the auction prizes was two years' commercial advertising on the back of the specially commissioned oncology bus which travels several times a week to Dublin hospitals.  It was described as a golden opportunity to promote a business.  The space was sold for €6,000.  That is why I am prepared to support co-location.  If we can find a reasonable solution to the question of beds, while continuing to debate value for money, by all means let us do so.  Let us, however, put the patient first as that is the priority.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I welcome the Government policy on co-location.  The point has been made that it is a Progressive Democrats-driven policy but it is important to remember that Fianna Fáil, when fighting the election, made it clear it fully supported the policy.  It was Government policy going out and it is Government policy coming back in.Co-location cannot be termed a "racket".  The people who supported the Government parties recognised that the proposal would free up waiting lists and create 1,000 new beds in the system.  That was the issue going before the people and that is what they supported.  In answer to the allegation that it is a racket, purely for profit, it is worth noting that the National Development Finance Agency, the financial advisers to the Department, has recognised the value for money in the proposal for co-location.It is also important to take other points into account.  We need change within the health structure.  The point has been made that, over the years, funding for health has quadrupled yet waiting lists have remained.  I congratulate the Minister on her initiative in bringing the policy of co-location before this House.  Co-location will mean that publicly-funded beds in public hospitals will always be available to all patients in order of medical need.  The initiative will free up designated public beds on each site.  Public beds will no longer be used for fee-paying private care.It is important to note more beds will be freed up than the number of designated private beds.  Most important is that, by the time this initiative has been implemented, we will have 1,000 new beds.  That will demonstrate cause and effect in regard to this proposal and will clear the waiting lists once and for all.I support the co-location policy because it is a way of increasing bed capacity in the major public hospitals, in a forward-thinking way, in a new partnership with the private sector, whose involvement I welcome.  I was alarmed when I heard the process characterised as one in which the rich go into a hospital and turn right or left and the poor turn the opposite way.  That is an unfair comment which does not stand up to scrutiny, particularly when it is recognised that, in the policy document, one accident and emergency unit is provided for on site.  There is no prospect of people being left to one side because they did not have the necessary financial arrangements.  The policy document also makes it clear there is no validity in the claim that facilities will be built to too high a specification.It is also important to recognise that the proposal will encourage investment.  It will be open to scrutiny and will be guided by the Department of Finance.  Any suggestion of plundering for profit alone will not stand the test of time.I publicly support the co-location policy.  It is one of many initiatives introduced by the Minister for Health and Children.  I am glad to see her back in the job and believe that, by the end of this Government's term in five years' time, the issues currently surrounding health will have been totally resolved.  I welcome this initiative, as well the many others the Minister has brought forward.

I firmly support the position adopted by the Minister for Health and Children and the Government in co-locating private beds on grounds attached to our public hospitals.The Minister should be complimented on the initiative and I also compliment her on the initiative to create the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That has been a success second to none.  Deputy McDaid stated that from his surgery alone, 171 patients have benefitted from this scheme.

The only deficiency in the scheme relates to the inability of people to get appointments with consultants.  I hope the Minister takes on that matter at some stage and sorts out the bottleneck that exists.  I am not accusing consultants, but I feel there is a reluctance to go ahead with appointments.  They know we can deal with the matter through the Department soon after that.The opportunity to provide 1,000 extra beds and free those beds that are currently being taken out of the public system for private use is an innovative and welcome development.  I compliment the Minister for it and I have no doubt it will be successful.  Any further investment in the health services by the private sector is most welcome.  Deputy McDaid made the point that we must keep investing because new technologies are coming into the health services all the time.I was here for the contribution to the debate by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  He is quite lucky that he has two private hospitals in his city.  They provide a wonderful service and he is lucky to have that service in Galway city.

If the Minister is looking for a location, we have about 25 acres attached to Roscommon County Hospital and I would support a decision to make that location available for any further expansion of the health services, whether private or public.  It would be very welcome.I compliment the Minister for her innovation in the health portfolio.  She has had five good years in it and I look forward to five more progressive years.  I have no doubt that the success behind her will be doubled by the time she finishes the job.  She has set out a very clear agenda which is becoming very apparent.  I am glad the consultants have had the common sense to go back into discussions with her and are now prepared to enter into new contracts.  I was glad she took the initiative in announcing new posts.  Sometimes people in government must take decisions and she is one who does this.  I am glad to support her decisions on issues that should have been dealt with many years ago.Vested interests in the health services have been a major problem and a block on services to the public over many years.  I am glad the Minister is taking on the vested interests and looking to the customers who come from the public.  The vested interests must take second place.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I congratulate Deputy Brian Hayes for his initiative in bringing the motion forward.  People are very divided and concerned about this issue.  There is grave concern that public property will be moved into private ownership at knock-down prices at the expense of the taxpayer.  There has been little consultation about this.  The Minister has not held any consultation.  It seems more an ideological approach to moving the entire health system into the private sector rather than a consultation on what is best for the delivery of patient care.There now will be two types of patient on site.  Those of us who are in politics a long time, and dealing with the public, see the divide in the service provided to people in hospitals.  Those who can afford private insurance and those who can afford to pay get a different level of service from those who cannot.  In dealing with the health service, that is the most glaring fact all of us face.  This relates especially to waiting lists, but also to other areas.  When somebody comes to you stating he or she has VHI or Quinn-Healthcare, one knows that he or she has a better opportunity of obtaining the service.  I have seen cancer patients having to wait three or four months for a proper consultation, whereas somebody who can afford private insurance will get attention within weeks.  This is unfair and discriminatory.  The proposal to co-locate in public hospitals will exacerbate that position.No doubt key personnel will move from the public service into the private service because the incentive will exist.  We all are human.  Consultants are human.  They will see a better return in being in the private sector and will move that way, and the investors will attract the key personnel, who are most qualified and who attract the most patients, into the private sector and leave those who are less qualified or in whom the people in the public sector have less confidence.  It will exacerbate the division between private and public delivery of patient care.  There is no evidence that the new system will be more efficient.Deputy McDaid spoke about the National Treatment Purchase Fund and in that regard, I want to raise an issue with the Minister.  I understand that those who wish to remove marks from their bodies, including tattoos, can be facilitated under the National Treatment Purchase Fund because it is a surgical intervention.

I do not have a difficulty about that, but a child waiting two years for a psychiatric consultation will not be facilitated under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  We know that intervention at an early stage in psychiatric illness and emotional difficulties, especially among children, is vital to the opportunity for a full recovery, and that is not allowed.  The Minister should examine psychiatric intervention under the National Treatment Purchase Fund because the longer someone is left without treatment, the more chronic the case becomes, the poorer the chance of recovery and the greater the later demands on the resources of the HSE.

The Government is effectively selling the family silver at a questionable price.  Many of the hospitals to be used are located in key areas of towns and cities, where the value of the land is high.  If we need to build public facilities in these areas, those of us who make representations on behalf of public hospitals are told decisions are delayed or the project will fail to be approved because of the lack of land in the area and the cost of buying land.  It is similar to the position of schools, where the purchase of land is delayed because of cost.  The same will happen in the provision of medical facilities.  Today's decisions will cost us dearly tomorrow.Co-location is hailed by the Government as the answer to all the problems in the health service.  Rather than seeking a quick fix solution the Government would be better occupied solving all problems in the system.  It sees co-location as the grand plan but the cost of the plan is less than clear.  One of the Government Deputies incorrectly referred to the number of hospital beds to which Fine Gael was committed.  The performance of the three Fianna Fáil Ministers at the press conference in respect of this issue was less than clear.

The public did not support giving public land to private developers.  Deputy Finneran has almost sold the site beside the hospital in Roscommon.  The area is not far from my constituency and I am aware of the difficulties.  I remind him that people in that constituency spoke very clearly and elected two Fine Gael candidates out of three seats.  He will hear that loud and clear when he returns to Roscommon-South Leitrim.  We are giving public land to private developers to build hospitals that will have the aim of making money, not caring for patients.  That there was no Green Paper to examine the issue and no cost benefit analysis calls the Government decision into question.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I congratulate Deputy Mary Harney on her appointment as Minister.  Responsibility for health is a difficult job and it is testament to her courage as an individual and her dedication as a politician that she sought the job despite her party's result in the election.I join with party colleagues in expressing my concern about the co-location proposal and my opposition to it, not just on the basis that it has no mandate, which is the case, but more important on the basis that it is bad public policy.  The policy is bad for three principal reasons.First, it will lead to the perpetuation of the two-tier health service.  Freeing up 1,000 public beds by providing 1,000 private beds misses the point.  What we should be trying to do is move towards a system where there are no private or public beds and no private or public patients in the health service.  The best way to achieve that is through a system of universal health insurance, as is done in many other countries, whereby all patients are effectively private patients and money follows the patient.  By going down the route of this co-location plan, the Minister is making it harder for future Governments and generations to achieve that.  She is making it especially difficult by introducing a new vested interest into the health care system in the form of up to ten private hospitals.The second reason I am opposed to this proposal is that it will result in the downgrading of our existing public hospitals.  New beds, new facilities, new radiology services and new laboratories will inevitably go to the co-located hospitals rather than public hospitals.  For example, the Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown has been waiting for almost 15 years for the implementation of phase 2, namely, the provision of new radiology and new laboratory facilities.  We know what will happen inevitably is that this investment will not be delivered; it will now turn up in the co-located hospital instead.In yesterday's debate the Minister stated Tallaght had not been bullied into making its decision in favour of co-location, but that is untrue.  Most members of that board are opposed to co-location but it was clear to them that if they did not agree to co-location, they would not get the beds or investment they need.  Essentially, hospital boards now have a gun to their heads and they are being told that if they do not back the Minister, Deputy Harney's co-location plan, there will not be investment in their hospitals.  That is not to mention the loss of revenue to them, which by the Minister's own estimation is €80 million per year for six hospitals.  I do not know how much it will be if there are nine or ten co-located hospitals.The third reason is a personal one.  I am not sure the Minister has considered the fact that by introducing co-location we will introduce a two-tier admissions policy in accident and emergency departments.  I am most concerned about this issue.  Essentially, an SHO or registrar admitting a patient in an accident and emergency department will for the first time have to make a distinction between a private patient and a public patient.  It will be necessary for the doctor on duty to talk to both the private hospital and the public hospital to see if a bed is available in one or the other.  If there is a space in the private hospital, the patient may get admitted; if there is no space, he or she will not get admitted in the public hospital either.It may also be necessary to talk to two different consultants, one in the private hospital and one in the public hospital where there may be different thresholds for admission depending on whether the patient would bring in money.  That is an ethical minefield for doctors.  Currently, the accident and emergency department is the only place in a hospital where patients are treated equally.  The Minister has proposed to get rid of this last area of equality in the health service by making a distinction between patients in accident and emergency departments at the point of admission.To sum up, this policy has no mandate from the people, it will reinforce the two-tier health system, downgrade public hospitals, cost the taxpayer millions and lay a new moral and ethical minefield for doctors admitting patients in accident and emergency departments.  It is a bad policy for the taxpayer, public hospitals, patients and society.  I appeal to Deputies to support the motion.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I thank my family and the people of Longford-Westmeath who elected me to represent them.  During my campaign I placed health at the top of my priorities for them when elected and pledged to bring about the long-promised completion of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital.  One may ask what this has to do with the debate but it is my contention that it is at its heart.  It relates not only to my priorities but to those which should be at the centre of the agenda of the Minister for Health and Children.  Sorting out the existing difficulties and outstanding projects in the health service should be to the fore in her endeavours rather than further diluting our resources.  Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not acceptable when the losers will be the public hospital sector.In reply to a question I tabled yesterday on phase 2B of Longford Westmeath General Hospital, which was the latest effort in my decade-long campaign to get closure on this issue, once again the Minister took refuge in the fact that she is waiting for a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the outstanding funding for this project, conveniently overlooking the fact that this issue has been dragged out for in excess of a decade and that she is trying to drip-feed the final funding necessary for the completion of this lifesaving facility for the midlands.Although many Members have asked the Minister to publish the cost-benefit analysis of all the aspects of the proposal under debate it is not available.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children show an alarming lack of knowledge of the financial implications of co-location and neither can give the full lifetime cost to the State of this proposal.Longford-Westmeath is a long way from the £62 million promised ten years ago, given the present delay in the provision of the sum of €45 million required to complete the project.  Lives will continue to be lost until this facility is fully up and running and I am determined to see this project completed sooner rather than later.  I call on the Minister to honour the Government's oft-repeated promise to the midlands in this regard.  Given an underspend of €100 million by the Health Service Executive in 2006, I am at a loss to understand how on the one hand the Government can continue to ignore the needs of the sick, the elderly and the disabled while on the other, the Exchequer grabs back the money earmarked for their well-being.However, the Minister's disregard for the suffering of her fellow man was surely illustrated horribly by her latest pronouncement in which she assured Members that it was pleasant for many patients on trolleys in accident and emergency departments.  The Minister's statement was outrageous and I wonder what the 200 or more patients who are forced daily to spend days on trolleys think about such an extraordinary utterance.Moreover, the Minister has stated clearly that a difference exists between her and the head of the HSE in respect of co-location policy.  The Minister's attempt to disregard the comments of the HSE's chief executive have only served to reveal a deeper disparity between his views, those of the Minister and Government policy.During both today's Question Time and this debate, the Minister has shown that there are key areas of confusion regarding the co-location policy.  Professor Drumm has stated that co-located hospitals and the HSE will be competitors, whereas the Minister has stated that the public and private facilities will be integrated.  Moreover, the Minister claims that the project is designed to provide an additional 1,000 acute beds, while the head of the HSE states there is no requirement for additional acute beds.While the Minister may attempt to blur the lines of these divisions, the facts are clear for all to see.  It appears that the HSE's chief executive has as much enthusiasm for the advancement of this project as does the public, who voted in such numbers for candidates who opposed it.  It is high time the Government recognised it as a misguided and ill-conceived plan before our health service is further damaged and vital public land is irretrievably lost.  This will be the case if the Minister proceeds with this policy.On behalf of the people of Longford-Westmeath and the entire region, I beg the Minister——

It is a sad day for Irish democracy that a policy that is so wrong and so widely rejected should still be pursued in this manner.  It is also sad and disgraceful that the Green Party and Independent Deputies who expressed strong opposition to co-location are now likely to vote for it along with Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats-Green Party Government is ploughing on regardless with its disastrous private for-profit hospital co-location scheme.  This plan must be stopped before it is too late.  It is the biggest single step towards the privatisation of our public health services.  It has met with widespread opposition, both from within the health services and from the wider public.I welcome the efforts of patient and community groups which yesterday highlighted the fraud carried out by the parent US corporations of private health care companies benefiting from Government money in this State.  These companies are lining up to profit from the co-location scheme.  They have also been given lucrative HSE contracts for cancer screening and cancer care.  Quest Diagnostics Incorporated in Ireland is under contract with the HSE to carry out smear tests in US laboratories.  From 1996 to 2004, it is reported that Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its predecessors in the US paid $175 million in settlements under the False Claims Act, involving, among others, charges for medically unnecessary tests and overcharging for prostate cancer blood tests.  Laboratories in Irish hospitals are being closed to give business to privateers such as this.At the heart of the Government's policy is a glaring contradiction.  On the one hand, it is removing services from local public hospitals on the spurious basis that they do not have the critical mass of patients to sustain them and, on the other, it is giving tax subsidies and access to land to private hospitals to provide services on a for-profit basis.  The co-location plan is being carried through by means of coercion.  The board of Tallaght Hospital was, despite the Minister of State's denial here this afternoon, presented with an ultimatum to accept co-location or to go without the additional beds needed.  This is an outrage.Sinn Féin Deputies will today and everyday continue to oppose this plan and the privatisation of our health services.  Accordingly, I welcome and look forward to supporting the Fine Gael Private Members' motion as tabled.

Private patients are receiving priority access to public hospitals at the expense of public patients.  Some 2,500 beds in public hospitals are ring-fenced for the exclusive use of private patients and that is not equitable or fair.  As the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated last night, the State pays for nurses and other staff to look after the patients in those beds and provides the diagnostic equipment needed, but the beds are off limits to patients unless they are the private patients of consultants.  The initiative will provide that 1,000 of the 2,500 beds in question can be used by public patients.In July 2005, the Minister issued a policy direction and the HSE identified the most appropriate sites to include in the initiative based on existing and planned capacity.  It identified what a co-located hospital would need to deliver for each site to best serve the interests of the public hospital and prospective patients.

When the co-located hospital has been built and opened, every public bed in the public hospital will be accessed on the basis of medical need and no other.  There will be no preferential treatment in the public hospital system for insured patients or self-payers.As part of its contract with the HSE, the co-located hospital must provide 24-hour admission, train doctors and share its profits.  Public hospitals will also benefit in the case of debt refinancing.  Details in respect of each site will be made public, but it is not possible to release details of bids during a procurement process or to provide commercially sensitive information.Last night, a figure of €700 million was quoted as the loss of income to hospitals, but the six hospitals in the first tranche of co-location collected €80 million from private health insurers in 2006, less than half the cost of running the beds.  No land is being given away.  The land on which the co-located hospitals will be built will be leased at above the market value.

The new private co-located hospitals will be required to provide services to the HSE at discounted prices under the rules of the capital allowance scheme.  Last night, the Opposition put forward a figure of €70 million for seven years in reference to the cost of the capital allowance scheme.  The precise capital allowance cost to the State of each project depends on the financial profile of each of the successful bids.  However, this is necessarily less than half the construction cost, since relief would be claimed at the marginal income tax rate applicable at the time.As the Minister pointed out last night, the capital allowance costs to the State will only come on stream after the new co-located hospital facilities have opened — from 2011 onwards — and the costs to the State will cease after the seventh year.  For every €1 million in allowable investment, the gross tax cost to the State would typically be €455,000 at current tax and PRSI rates, spread over seven years, without taking account of tax buoyancy from the activity generated.  The expected capital allowance costs have been included in the financial evaluations of tenders.Last night, Deputy McManus questioned the statutory basis for the policy direction on the co-location initiative that issued to the HSE in July 2005.  The Minister is satisfied that this policy direction conforms with section 10 of the Health Act 2004.  Claims were made by Members last night and again today that the HSE bullied Tallaght Hospital.  However, the board of the hospital was asked whether it wished to continue to participate in the co-location initiative.

No hospital has been forced  to participate in this initiative.Private health care has always been a feature of the State's health care system, and public and private service provision have complemented each other.  Access to public hospitals should be based on need only.  The co-location initiative will provide an additional 1,000 beds for public patients.  Private patients at these hospitals will be treated in the new co-located private hospitals.  It is the quickest and least expensive means of providing 1,000 beds for public patients.  There is much interest in the initiative.  The HSE has evaluated tenders for six sites and expects to appoint the successful bidders following approval from its board at the beginning of next month.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I am pleased to have the opportunity to express concern at the Government's plans to build private hospitals on public hospital lands.  I thank Deputy Hayes, our new spokesperson on health, for bringing this motion forward so quickly.  It is appropriate that we are debating two of the key issues concerning the electorate in the first week of the new Dáil.  Earlier today we discussed stamp duty reform and we are now dealing with hospital health care provision.  Ironically, it is the Opposition and not the Government that reflected the public mood in our calls for a comprehensive stamp duty reform package and an end to the controversial and unpopular plan to locate new private hospital beds on public hospital sites.The Progressive Democrats Party approach to health care reform was rejected comprehensively by the electorate.  Yet there is no reflection of that in the new Government's policy.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has on many occasions justified her plans for co-location by claiming it is the quickest and most effective way to introduce more beds into the hospital system by freeing up beds in public hospitals currently occupied by private patients.  This makes some sense mathematically.  What about the other factors which need to be considered and what is the cost of such a plan?  One would assume with plans this far advanced that detailed costings and a cost-benefit analysis would be available and publicised but not even the Minister for Finance knew during the election how much this plan would cost the taxpayer.  We were first told it would be co-neutral and that the taxpayer would not have to pay anything.  On "Questions and Answers", the Minister quoted a figure of €70 million per year over seven years, or nearly €500 million.  The following day, that figure was again revised in a press conference and we were told it would cost €40 million.  This is the Government's main plank for hospital health care provision, yet we do not even know how much it will cost in terms of site leasing cost and tax relief on investment.Pragmatic problems also arise, particularly in the area of staffing.  At present, seven private hospitals are being built or are in the pipeline.  Adding a further eight co-located hospitals will bring the number to 15.  With limited availability of consultants, experienced nursing specialists and, most important, the absence of a new consultant contract, we run the risk of supporting the building of private hospitals without adequate planning for how they will be staffed or consideration of the knock-on staffing consequences for public hospitals.However, my strongest objection to the Government's insistence on pursuing the co-location policy is a more principled one.  Issues such as costing and staffing implications can be addressed with a pragmatic response but the question which must be asked is whether we should be selling valuable landbanks on public hospital campuses for the construction of private hospital beds when we urgently need additional beds in our public hospital system.  Should we not instead prioritise the financing of public hospital beds and the expansion of public health care provision?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	481	How can we maximise the potential of public landbanks on public hospital sites?  Fine Gael has no problem with the principle of private hospitals being built on private sites and it is ridiculous for Government spokespersons to suggest otherwise.  We have not been inconsistent at any stage in what we have said on this issue.  However, we are strongly opposed to the sale of precious landbanks which could be used for the expansion of public hospital provision and which will have significant implications in the medium and long term for public health care and hospital expansion programmes.As Deputy Enright noted earlier, in the same way that we encounter problems in finding sites for new schools, we could end up leasing precious landbanks for long periods of time only to pay out huge amounts of money to provide public hospital beds.  That seems like mad logic.  By facilitating the construction of additional private for-profit hospitals as a policy alternative to building public hospital beds, we are increasing the public's reliance on private health care provision.  That will only serve to deepen the divide between those who can afford private health insurance and those who cannot and threatens to widen the already existing gulf between the quality of care a public can expect compared to the care received by private patients.  Surely modern Ireland should aspire to something different.  I urge the Minister to reconsider how the State can make best use of the available valuable landbanks on public hospital sites to advance health care provision and prioritise public patients.

My first reaction to the co-location concept was amazement because there is no way it can benefit public patients who cannot gain access to hospital beds at present and remain on trolleys and waiting lists.The proposal before us, as my colleague Deputy Coveney has pointed out, will not in any way alleviate the problems that exist.  In fact, it will contribute to them.  I cannot understand how private patients who are allegedly occupying public beds in public hospitals at present will suddenly disappear from the face of the earth, to be replaced by public patients.  I do not think that will happen.A new formula has been found.  A number of years ago when Deputy Micheál Martin was Minister for Health and Children, he decided to solve the health problem.  He had discovered that the problem was the health boards, so he abolished them.  That was the panacea that was going to solve all the health problems for the foreseeable future.  What happened?  Absolutely nothing happened, except that the problems that existed before got immeasurably worse.  This has gone on and on.  The current Minister for Health and Children and former Tánaiste has obviously been in the Department, shifting around and sifting in the sands, looking for some other magic formula to solve the health problems.It will not work.  In four or five years' time somebody will tumble to the notion that it was a bad, expensive experiment.  In the mid-1980s a proposal was put forward to realise as much from State assets as possible.  The Government decided to sell sites owned by CIE, Iarnród Éireann and other lands owned by the State.  That is what happened and a number of years later people asked why it was done.  Why we are doing this now?  There is no evidence to support the concept that this proposal will address the issue that must be addressed, namely the deficit in the public health service.I cannot see any evidence of the much vaunted benefit to the public health sector and no Government speaker has illustrated from where it will derive.  If one discusses the issue with health service workers, they will tell one that the service is full of chiefs, with not enough Indians.  There are many turf wars going on and health workers will tell one that readily.Let us examine some of the structures that will emerge.  Let us suppose the proposal goes wrong, which I believe it will.  How will we unravel the leases on the white elephants sitting on public hospital grounds for our lifetime and long after that?  How will the beds be shared out and in what proportion?  The Minister said these matters will be resolved but many other simpler issues within the health service have not yet been resolved and will not be in our lifetime unless some other formula is found.The delivery of health services begins with local health centres.  We have a reasonably good network of health centres throughout the country which could be upgraded, thus relieving a considerable amount of the burden on accident and emergency departments, providing a very valuable service, complimentary to hospital services.I worry about the logic behind this proposal.  In recent years, in the Department of Health and Children, somebody who Members of this House cannot identify, has been making decisions.  Somebody made a decision to close St. Luke's Hospital and to relocate the children's hospital to a place, it was said, which would be convenient because it was on bus, train and Luas routes.  One must ask who goes to hospital on a bus or a train.  Has anyone heard of a child or adult doing that?  What motivated the people who came up with those answers?  Do they think we are all fools?  With regard to the proposed relocation of the children's hospital, surely someone argued that the Mater Hospital site is very confined and inaccessible from all quarters and that it would be better to build a new hospital on a site that is accessible, readily available and large enough to accommodate the requirements of that sector for the foreseeable future.  That did not happen, however, and it is unlikely to occur.  I want to issue a friendly warning to Members on the Government side of the House.  I do not know whether that was a policy of the Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil, the Green Party or the Independents, but there must be some policy there that somebody will own up to.

In the aftermath of the general election, the Government is ignoring the will of the people.  I do not know what people said to the Government candidates, but in the course of the election, not a single person said to us that a great job was being done on the health service, that they agreed with co-location, the closure of St. Luke's Hospital or the relocation of the National Children's Hospital.  No one in the country made such a statement, as far as I am aware.  We have done our best to make the case and bring the issue to public attention.  God help the Government Deputies if they ignore it.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	485	I thank all my colleagues who contributed to this important debate both yesterday and today.  We have heard excellent contributions, including some particularly good maiden speeches from colleagues on all sides.  It should be noted that during the debate we did not hear one contribution from the Green Party.  This is the same party whose Member, Deputy Gormley, described the co-location proposal as a Frankenstein in a press statement issued six months ago.  He did not have the courage of his convictions to explain why he has done such a drastic U-turn on the issue.  The Green Party has serious questions to answer in respect of its duplicity, given the firm commitments it gave the public during the recent election campaign.The Minister, Deputy Harney, had to leave the House as she was so overcome by the love-bombing from Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  It was not always this way, of course.  About a month ago they were individually filleting her in each of the 43 constituencies because she was being blamed for public anger on the doorsteps.  I recall the remarks of Deputy O'Flynn at the time, who was specific as to where the blame lay.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	487	A few weeks later, however, all that has been forgotten.  Speaking from both sides of one's mouth at the same time is a path well trodden by Fianna Fáil backbenchers over the years.One of the most fundamental questions in this debate was posed by Deputy McManus, although it was not answered by the Minister of State.  Since May, she has been attempting to elicit a response, by way of correspondence, concerning the statutory basis for this proposal.  The Minister said the Government's initial decision conforms to section 10 of the Health Act 2004.  It has taken them eight weeks to come up with that pathetic explanation, which goes to the heart of this problem.  I believe the Government is making it up as it goes along.  It has not thought through any of the consequences that will follow once our land is handed over, even by way of lease, to private for-profit hospitals.  A Government decision was taken 18 months or two years ago, which has no statutory basis.  We could face litigation from any of the unsuccessful bidders for each of these hospitals.  In addition, we could face litigation on EU competition grounds from any of the existing private hospitals which bought their own land ten or 15 years ago because of this preferential deal that is now being given to new private hospitals on public lands.  If the Government is going into this Frankenstein scenario, as Deputy Gormley called it six months ago, it should do so with its eyes open.  The Government could quite quickly find itself in courts up and down the country and I have not heard a legitimate statutory or legal reference point, bar the kind of limp excuse I heard from the Minister tonight.My party has no problem with private money in medicine.  I would have no great difficulty, in principle, with the Government allowing private builders to construct a hospital and lease it back to the State, provided the State runs the operation.  We have no problem with public private partnerships, PPPs, in the construction of new schools, but this proposal is like handing the schools over to the private sector tomorrow.  There is no argument for such a course of action and it has never happened before.  Schools are built by the private sector but are still controlled by Marlborough Street and the same principle should apply when it comes to hospitals.Last night the Minister said this unified model of public and private hospitals working side by side will benefit everyone.  Do people actually believe that?  In the real world, will public patients receive exactly the same treatment as private patients?  Such a suggestion is absolute rubbish, as every Member of this House knows.  The two-tiered system of health care that exists at the moment is deliberately beneficial to private patients and this will continue.The notion that intensive care beds will be divvied up between public patients and private patients is rubbish.  If there is only one intensive care bed and both a public patient and private patient need it, who will get it?  If an anaesthetist is working at 2.30 a.m. and calls come from both the private hospital and public hospital, where will he or she go?  This is all on the basis of the service agreement the Minister spoke of, yet her chief executive officer in the HSE suggests the HSE will be in competition with such ventures with no unified system.  This, Sir, is more of the same from the Government, thinking things up as it goes along, putting things in the public domain when caught on the hoof.The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, revealed the new piece of the jigsaw to the House last night that the green light for this project has been by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.  This is a new piece of information and I would like to hear from the Minister in the coming days how it came about.  Was it as a result of this Private Members' motion that the National Development Finance Agency suddenly produced its report, like a rabbit from a hat, stating that this is fine and should proceed?  This report still has not been published and we have not received a copy.  I request that the Minister immediately send a full copy of the report to the health spokespersons on the Opposition benches.  I want that report in the public domain.  The Government, surprisingly, could not produce a copy of this report for the past six months but, hey presto, the election is over and the report has emerged.Are people fools?  The 52% of the population with private medical insurance will pay greatly for this proposal and they have seen their premiums double in the past ten years.  Premiums will double again because of this stroke that is being played.The Minister argues that locating two hospitals on one site means consultants will go merrily back and forth between hospitals rather than whizz around town wasting time.  There is nothing to prevent consultants from working in three or four hospitals.The majority of people oppose this proposal because it is a tax wheeze that is deeply contrary to their wishes.  The majority of Deputies elected to this 30th Dáil object to and have taken stances against this proposal.  It is now time for Deputies to put their money where their mouths are, honour the mandate they received from their constituents and reject this proposal, which will have drastic consequences for public health care for a generation to come.

I suggest that if that does not happen in the next couple of years the Taoiseach, if for no other reason than to preserve the sanity of the remaining backbenchers in the Fianna Fáil Party, will have no choice but to introduce yet another Bill  providing for possibly an additional ten Ministers of State to be appointed  to the existing Departments.  We need to tackle the manner in which this House operates and the fact that the ability of Deputies to act as legislators is curtailed.  If we do not soon introduce major reforms of this House, public cynicism about the way we work and the level of disinterest in politics will increase and as a result fewer people will vote at the next election.A rather strange crowd is assembled at the back of the Chamber.

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	490	Unlike other Opposition parties, Sinn Féin Deputies will not oppose this legislation.  There are genuine concerns that the creation of additional Ministers of State may be for the purpose of rewarding political colleagues.  However, in looking at the list of junior ministerial positions, Sinn Féin is not so much concerned about numbers.  For us, the key question is whether these positions allow for necessary additional focus on vital areas of public policy.  We are, therefore, taking an open-minded position on the increased numbers of Ministers of State and are not prepared simply to oppose it for opposition's sake.For example, we welcome the fact that the drugs portfolio and the housing portfolio each has a full junior Minister looking after what are important areas of social policy.  We have long argued that these two portfolios needed a stronger focus and this arrangement should allow for such an approach.  Given that it is the start of the new Dáil, I express the hope that the creation of the position of Minister of State with responsibility for housing, urban renewal and developing areas will concentrate the minds of the Government on the need for a real housing policy with a proactive role for the State and local authorities.  For the past decade the Government has abdicated its responsibility to provide social and affordable housing and has abandoned to market forces this key area of public need.  All around us we see the dire consequences, in terms of bad planning, substandard housing and prices spiralling way beyond the means of many thousands of people seeking a home.We are disappointed by the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs strategy and community affairs is linked only to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  We believe that a cross-departmental approach, including the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is necessary for the development and implementation of a cohesive drugs strategy.  We believe the threat to our society posed by drugs warrants such an approach and we call for it to be adopted.  I would welcome the Minister giving a positive indication in that regard in his closing remarks to this debate.I welcome the appointment of Deputy Brendan Smith, my constituency colleague, to the position of Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, with responsibility for children.  This is an important post, with much progress needed in areas such as child care, children's health, special needs and tackling educational and economic disadvantage.  I wish the Deputy well in his new portfolio responsibility.  As Sinn Féin's spokesperson on health and children, I will be carefully following the progress that he will record across all the key areas that impact on the needs and well-being of our children.I welcome the new position of Minister of State with responsibility for integration policy, who has a cross-departmental portfolio similar to the position Sinn Féin advocates for the drugs portfolio.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, will again note the point I have made.  If it can apply in this instance, surely it should apply in the other instance.  It makes best sense.  We will be watching the performance of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, in his new role.  He can be assured of that.I welcome the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for services for older people and I congratulate Deputy Máire Hoctor on her elevation to the junior ministerial ranks.  We in Sinn Féin advocated the creation of this post in line with the campaigning case put forward by Age Action and other senior citizen lobby groups.  There is a need for more clarity and more concentration on the implementation of the national disability strategy.  Sinn Féin proposed that this would be a function of the Department of the Taoiseach, with a dedicated unit in that Department with cross-departmental responsibility.  The Government has appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health under the aegis of the Minister for Health and Children.  I extend good wishes to Deputy Jimmy Devins in his first ministerial brief.  Disability is primarily an equality issue rather than a health issue.  Nonetheless, we hope that the full implementation of the national disability strategy, with yearly targets, will be pursued vigorously by the new Minister of State.We are concerned that tackling educational disadvantage has been dropped from the title of the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science.  We hope that this is not a signal that the incoming Government will put less emphasis on tackling educational disadvantage.  There needs to be clear responsibility and a clear determination to make progress in this vital area.However these posts pan out in practice, we will all monitor each of them carefully and Sinn Féin will present keen and focused opposition throughout the term before us.  Non-governmental organisations and campaigning groups across a whole spectrum of interests will welcome the designation of their focus, their issues and their needs to a stand-alone portfolio holder.  This has long been a demand of many groups and organisations whose expertise and recommendations should be acknowledged, appreciated and acted upon.  These new Ministers of State and their streamlined senior Ministries have a real opportunity to make a critical difference in the lives of many people, including people with disabilities, drugs issues and housing needs, older people and children.  On behalf of the Sinn Féin Deputies — this is something they will not always hear from an Opposition party or group of voices — I wish all the new Ministers of State a fair wind, but I caution them not to disappoint.

I had a few remarks to make, but it is difficult to make them in just one minute.  The appointments are obviously dictated by pressure for promotion rather than any real policy need.  That is fair enough in present circumstances.  Some years ago, there were many part-timers in the Dáil who pursued their own profession for the best part of the week.  We have full-time politicians now and there needs to be a career path for politicians in the Government and in the Opposition.  The committees are not fulfilling that role at the moment.  There must be a better balance between the Executive and the Parliament, but we do not have a tradition of the powerful committees that might stand up to the Executive, as happens in other parliaments.  I will have an opportunity to develop these thoughts in future.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I thank the Members for their wide-ranging comments and thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for his support.  Fundamentally, the Bill is about increasing the number of Ministers of State from 17 to 20.Deputy Bruton stated it would cost €4 million and I do not know how he arrived at that.  The cost of a Minister of State, depending on the number of years' service, is probably between €40,000 and €50,000, and if one takes account of the daily allowance which Ministers of State do not receive, there is probably very little in it.  If one includes a full complement of staff, one might come up with a figure of over €1 million, provided one included press advisers and all those other sorts of advisers of which I heard Deputies speak, which in my five years as a Minister of State I personally have not seen.It was interesting to hear the different comments.  Deputy Burton spoke of Ministers of State being stuck in so many different Departments.  In many cases that is necessary, where there is no structure.  That is in total contrast with the drugs area in which I served, for example, because the structure exists.  The Minister chairs the interdepartmental group which is made up of principal officers and assistant secretaries, and the National Drugs Strategy Team which is made up of persons from all the Departments who give two and a half days a week to this specific function.  The Minister of State presides over the cross-departmental team.  Many of these Ministers of State are looking at new policy areas where there is that joined-up government or cross-departmental process, and the drugs area is a good example of how it is working.  The Minister of State in that area, at least in my time, did not need to be involved in the other Departments because the officials are part of the process and the structure exists.  That example is being rolled out.  While Deputy Burton ridiculed the fact that some Ministers of State might have a foot, a toe or an involvement in three or four Departments, it is to pull together the policy structure in many of those areas.Fundamentally, the Bill is quite brief.  It merely increases the number from 17 to 20.  The cost involved is far less than €4 million.  It might be somewhat over €1 million per office, if one had all those press and other advisers which certainly not many Ministers of State see.  Other Deputies in the A-team might get such assistance but the Ministers of State do not.I thank Deputies for their comments and seek their support.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	494	Are formal delegation orders being sent?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	495	That will follow.  From my five years of experience, in some cases one can have a delegation order and in others one does not.  As Deputy Noonan will be aware, much depends on the relationship the Minister has with the Minister of State.  Some Ministers of State will say that they had great freedom without delegation orders and some of them might be honest enough to say that, depending on the individual and how confident or otherwise the Minister was, one might not always enjoy the freedom one might like, with or without a delegation order.  Much depends on the individual Minister and I am sure Deputy Noonan would know far more about it than I would.  That issue will flow down.I suppose it is good for the Minister of State to have the delegation order in that the structure and the Civil Service take more note of it.  In some cases Ministers have the overall responsibility for bringing matters to Cabinet but it generally works better if one has a delegation order, although it is not always essential and, from my limited experience, it is not always the test of whether one has the freedom to properly examine a role or not.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19827	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I wonder whether the Minister of State has the authority to consider any consolidation within the various roles that have been set out.  It seems extraordinary that there are separate Ministries for forestry, fisheries and horticulture, compared to other sectors that assume greater importance in the development of the economy.  What thinking went into the selection of subsectors for which a Minister of State has responsibility?  Does it continue because it was always done this way?  Is there any consideration of the sectors that require specialist oversight by political masters?Some years ago, Mr. Colm McCarthy humorously referred to the number of hairdressers and suggested that we should have An Bord Gruaig to address their concerns in a manner similar to how other interests are addressed by State boards and Ministers of State.  Will the Minister of State consider consolidation within the ranks of the Ministers of State?  In this way when new tasks are required, as is the case with the Ministers of State with responsibility for innovation and older people, we can consolidate and make room for new tasks.  If we need a new Minister of State for every task it will continue to grow indefinitely, with the taxpayer as the patsy.Does the Minister of State have any mandate in respect of how this will develop?  Perhaps he could suggest the need for an objective review of the areas that justify a Minister of State.  We could apply the resources of the talented people promoted to these posts more effectively if we identified sectors with genuine new challenges.  I welcomed the increased attention given to some areas, such as drugs.  In other areas I fail to see the impact that Ministers of State have.  As I stated on Second Stage, there should be an obligation on Government to set out the areas of responsibility, the expectation of performance and some way in which the House, which ultimately sanctions the appointments, can decide that the concerns are valid, that new challenges exist, that genuine policy initiatives are pursued and that it is not a case of leaving someone in the position because there was always someone in it.  I wish to see this set out in the House, in order not to trivialise the appointment of the Ministers of State as has been the case.  The Oireachtas has virtually no say in the shape of administration even though we deal with the consequences of poor administration on a daily basis.  We have views, as have the Government backbenchers, on how ministerial responsibility should be structured.  I would like more creativity in involving the Houses in shaping Government administration.  I also seek greater involvement in the shaping of policy and legislative programmes, for which Deputy Shatter called.  Backbenchers and the Opposition have no real opportunity for input.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I return to the issue of delegation orders.  We are giving authority to the Government to appoint three additional Ministers of State.  Some 17 Ministers of State have a legal basis for their appointments.  There has been some discussion as to whether the appointments are cosmetic or real, politically driven or policy driven.  The point can be argued back and forth but the acid test is whether the individual has authority underpinned by a delegation order.  If there are no delegation orders they have no legal authority to carry out functions in the Department without the consent and assent of a Minister.  On the other hand, if they are appointed to a specific role and have delegation orders they have legal authority to carry out specific functions even though the Minister has overall responsibility for policy.  This is a key issue.For instance, if Deputy Hoctor with her new responsibility for the elderly does not have a delegation order, her writ will not run unless it coincides totally with the senior Minister who is a member of a different party.  The responsibilities of a number of Ministers of State are intended to cross Departments.   The Minister of State with responsibility for children is considered a senior position with the officeholder, Deputy Brendan Smith, being allowed to attend Cabinet meetings but not having voting rights there.  The ludicrous situation could arise whereby he would have a delegation order in respect of his role in the Department of Health and Children but he might not have delegation orders in respect of his roles in the Departments of Education and Science or Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is crucial this matter is addressed.  If these positions are real, policy-driven ones and they are deemed by the Government to be necessary from a policy point of view to implement part of the programme for Government, then the officeholders should be given the legal authority to do the job.  If it is a kind of "how's your father" arrangement with the senior Minister and if it hinges on the relationship between the senior Minister and the junior Minister, the precedents are not great.One could consult the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, about her relationship with her senior Minister in her first appointment as junior Minister with responsibility for issues close to the heart of her new partners in Government, namely, the Environmental Protection Agency among other issues.  Her senior Minister was the former Minister, Mr. Flynn, from Mayo.  Everything works while everybody is friendly and until there is a difference of opinion.  When that happens, in the absence of a delegation order, only one voice prevails, the voice of the Cabinet Minister.Many of us in the House would in all sincerity have difficulty in naming the Ministers of State who recently went out of office.  We would have difficulty in naming the names and nominating their portfolios.  Due to the fact that they did not have delegation orders, the arrangement was informal.  They only had the trappings of office.  I do not criticise that; trappings go with office, but the Ministers of State did not have the statutory authority to do the job they were supposed to do.What I want to establish in this debate is whether it will be different this time.  Are titles such as "Minister for the elderly" or "Minister for children" or whatever is the title for the Minister of State with responsibility for tackling the drugs issue, driven by PR and a desire to indicate that serious action will be taken in particular areas simply because the titles are appropriate, or do they signify a real intention to give the people who have been promoted and who have ability, the authority to carry out the job?When he is replying, perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, will inform us about the 17 Ministers of State who have already been appropriately appointed under existing legislation, how many of their functions have been designated by order by their senior Minister and of the three new Ministers of State who are being appointed, whether it is the intention that their functions would also be designated by a delegation order?
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	498	This appointment of extra junior Ministers is a bizarre arrangement.  A senior Minister should be responsible for the full ambit of responsibilities within his or her Department.  A junior Minister should act within that ambit.  From my experience in Dáil Éireann I found that junior Ministers were necessary only in so far as their subordinates are concerned.To my mind, this constitutes jobs for the boys and girls.  Deputy Máire Hoctor has been appointed Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly.  She is a reputable Member who has been elected by the people of Tipperary North and is a person who is well able to carry out her duties.  However, she is meant to see to the needs of the nation's elderly.  What other Member is better qualified to look after the elderly than the Deputy who should be responsible?  I refer to the Deputy from Sligo-North Leitrim.  To have a proper approach to such Ministers of State, one must appoint them to carry on with responsibilities that overlap with the senior Minister concerned.  There is no point in creating additional posts.When John Bruton as Taoiseach created two additional posts, he incurred vehement protests in this House from all angles.  However, at that time he put a man in charge of the islands, namely, the former Deputy, Donal Carey, from Clare.  He put his imprint on the offshore islands throughout the jurisdiction.  The first time island people received recognition was from John Bruton as Taoiseach and Donal Carey as Minister for State with responsibility for the islands.  He gave them a £1 million budget, which constituted the first relief ever secured for the people of the islands.  This was a worthy cause.However, we now have jobs for the boys and girls, to be brought in from the outside and to preside over what I would describe as nonsensical Departments.  The time has come for common sense to prevail in this House.  Members are either with it or they are not.  If they are unable to govern and if Ministers are not responsible for their Departments, why appoint an excessive number of Ministers of State to take care of matters that should be the responsibilities of the respective Ministers?It is time to let common sense prevail.  I appeal to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Ahern, who knows his business well and knows where the shoe pinches.  If Fianna Fáil gets back in again after the next election, its Members will appoint 25, not 20, Ministers of State.  Is the sky the limit?  Let sanity and common sense prevail.

The Minister of State questioned where Deputy Richard Bruton got the figure of the millions of euro it will cost the Exchequer to appoint the additional Ministers of State.  While I am delighted to hear they have specific roles within their Departments, how can the Minister of State prove this is the case?  Have they signed some form of order?  The Minister of State should answer this question in the House tonight.  He should not leave the House without doing so because when Opposition Members approach a Minister of State, it is important to know whether he or she has some real clout or must revert to the senior Minister of the relevant Department.  Were I or any other Deputy to bring a delegation from our respective constituencies, there would be no point in going to the messenger boy or girl.  One would go to the highest level in the Department.  Will the Minister of State answer my question tonight?Deputy Sheehan is correct in that this is about jobs for the boys and girls.  The Taoiseach has many people to please and the best way to do so is to give them jobs, State cars and staff.  However, what is given should not stop there.  Have the people in question specific roles in their Departments?

This is a matter of joined-up Government, a phrase Fine Gael used often during the election.  As good and as perfect as the Civil Service is, civil servants fight battles on behalf of their Departments in many instances.  Where cross-cutting issues are involved, Ministers of State with responsibilities that cross a number of Departments are beneficial.  Delegation orders are issued.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I am not an authority in this regard, but Ministers heard which specific functions the Taoiseach was allocating.  The allocation was passed by Government.While I may be wrong, not every Minister of State gets specific delegation orders approved by the Cabinet.  From anecdotal information, those who might not have delegation orders might be given more freedom or have a greater amount of their Ministers' confidence than those with delegation orders.  I will try to find out for the Deputies the percentage of people who have delegation orders, but that information is not known yet.  The issue will drift for two months or so before the roles have bedded down.Deputy Bruton asked how Minister of State positions are granted.  Some are traditional whereas others are new and cut across different Departments, which seems to be the trend.  Issues can run across many Departments and it is necessary to pull them together under a Minister of State who can give them time and energy because Ministers, who can be busy with many matters, will concentrate on the core issues.  Pulling the issues and functions together has been beneficial.  For example, the integration and innovation functions touch on several Departments.Ministers of State have influence and power. Ministers may have overall responsibility but the question is whether Ministers of State also have influence and power, whether delegations will be interested in putting their case to them and so on.  That is very much the case.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19827	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	517	This is not a trivial matter.  If there is to be any degree of integrated thinking across Departments, there must be delegated orders, particularly in respect of Ministers of State with cross-cutting responsibilities.  Without these, there is no authority.  We have seen time and again in the case of initiatives at cross-departmental level that if the body that controls the budget does not consider these cross-cutting operations to be important, they will stifle them at birth.Will the Minister of State convey to the Taoiseach the view of my party that he should insist that every Minister issues delegation orders specifying powers to the relevant Ministers of State?  That is the only means by which the latter will have some meaningful role to play.  It is vital for the protection of Ministers of State and for the purpose of ensuring better governance.  I ask the Minister of State to convey that view formally.

Five Ministers of State for one Minister represents a complex structure.  Will we be given a flowchart to indicate how the various responsibilities will be executed?  I do not understand why a Minister who is deemed to be competent should need five Ministers of State.  Can we have some information on the designation of functions?  Three other Departments — Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Enterprise, Trade and Employment — each have four Ministers of State.  I understand this is unprecedented in the history of the State.We have emphasised the need to specify the delegated functions.  From those functions flow responsibilities and authority in regard to budgets and powers of decision-making.  I also pointed out the case of the proposed Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, who will have responsibility in no less than four Departments.  That barely leaves him time to visit one Department on each day of the working week.  There must be clarification in this regard.  Is this duplication a joke?  Will the Minister of State demonstrate that it has some meaning and its implications for the various Departments?

Ministers of State will obviously not necessarily have an office in each of four Departments.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.The individual involved is 18 years old and after spending 13 years at the Nano Nagle special school in Listowel, she commenced a three-year training course at the St. John of God training centre, Ashe Street, Tralee, last September.  The course deals with independent living including the use of ATM machines, shopping skills and other social skills.  Her self-esteem and confidence have improved considerably and she is very happy with the course.  Her parents are also very happy that she is making considerable progress.The individual's sister has driven her to the centre every morning since she commenced the course and she was allowed to use the bus servicing St. Ita's and St. Joseph's special school in Tralee to travel home every evening.  This bus collected her at the centre and the arrangement worked well.  However, as St. Ita's and St. Joseph's school has now closed for the summer holidays she has no transport home in the afternoon.  Her sister will not be able to drive her to the centre over the next three months as she will not be working in Tralee.An application was made to the Health Service Executive for funding for a taxi service.  However, I understand this will not be granted because it would cost too much as the individual involved lives over 13 miles from Tralee.  The individual is not capable of using public transport as she is not mature enough to do so and could be vulnerable if she were to meet the wrong person.  Her parents, who are very concerned, are willing to play their part but expect to receive some assistance from the State.  This does not seem to be forthcoming.  Surely the public finances needed to look after individuals such as the girl in question are available.The girl wishes to complete this course.  Her parents also want her to continue the training course but it now seems they may have to keep her at home and she may have to abandon her course because transport is not being provided.  As I indicated, while her parents are willing to help with the transport, they are not prepared to transport her twice a day.  Both of them are getting older and need some assistance in this regard.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to direct the Health Service Executive to provide the necessary assistance in this case.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the important issues raised by Deputy Deenihan.  I emphasise the Government's commitment to providing a high-quality service to all those with a disability.  This commitment is illustrated by the substantial investment we have made in disability services in recent years.  Between 1997 and 2006, additional revenue and capital funding of €851 million was invested in health funded support services for people with disabilities, of which €549 million was provided for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.A sum of €75 million for revenue purposes was provided for disability services in the 2007 budget, of which €41 million was provided for people with intellectual disability and those with autism.  This sum incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the national disability strategy, which is committed to providing approximately €900 million capital and revenue funding over the period from 2005 to 2009.  The €41 million will provide 255 new residential places, 85 new respite places and 535 new day service places.  This funding includes €2.2 million for the transfer of persons with an intellectual disability or autism from settings which are inappropriate to their needs.The priority in 2007 is on enhancing the assessment and support services for children with disabilities.  This will also help to build the additional capacity in multidisciplinary and other support services required under the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.On the matter raised by the Deputy, I understand from the Health Service Executive that the St. John of God, Kerry, services are not funded directly to provide transport to and from the home locations of their service users.  Consequently, many service users and their families access funding for transport from the community welfare department of the Health Service Executive, southern region, to fund private transport arrangements such as taxis, depending on the individual's circumstances and-or location.  The executive has also advised that the person referred to by the Deputy in details supplied has applied to the community welfare officer for the Health Service Executive's southern region in Tralee and the matter is under active consideration.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I wish to share time with Deputy Creed.  The issue I raise arises from the decision by a former Minister for Transport, Deputy Seamus Brennan, to break up Aer Rianta into three airport authorities, namely, Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  At the time, the then Minister stated on a visit to Cork:When I establish the independent Shannon and Cork authorities on a statutory basis they will both commence business free of debt.  The existing debts associated with both airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme at Cork will not be assigned to the new companies but will remain with Dublin Airport.At the time the Minister also stated, "Given the strong growth at Dublin, the overall scale of operations there and the reality of the present situation, I do not feel that absorbing the debts for Shannon and Cork would place an unreasonable additional burden on Dublin."It is a different situation today.  There has been no movement on the proposed separation of the three airport authorities, no move on the independence of Cork Airport and obfuscation and denial by the Government on the debt issue.  Despite continual pressing from Members of this House, local public representatives, the chamber of commerce in Cork and the Cork Airport Authority, the Government still refuses to commit to the debt free status that was originally promised.  The Government has been hiding behind consultants' reports instigated by the Dublin Airport Authority, the Cork Airport Authority and the Government itself but there has been no resolution of the issue.This was everybody's favourite issue before the election, whether one was in Opposition, a member of the governing parties or the leader of the Green Party.  As reported in the media, the former leader of the Green Party, Deputy Trevor Sargent, signed a pledge in Cork stating he would commit to ensuring that Cork Airport would be independent and debt free.  We were told the programme for Government would contain a commitment to ensuring Cork Airport's debt free independent status but there is no sign of it.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Sargent, should explain to the House exactly where he stands on this issue.  He should explain how he was able to sign a pledge as leader of the party when in Opposition but now, when he has led his party into Government and seconded the nomination for Taoiseach last week, we see no sign of that commitment in the programme for Government.This is a serious matter.  The airport has been open for 12 months but there has been no resolution to the debt issue.  Nobody knows who is paying for the airport because it has not been made clear.  Morale is very low at the airport.  The Cork Airport Authority refuses to accept anything other than debt free status.  We need a resolution of this issue, which is very important for Cork Airport but even more important for the Cork region.  Without a viable airport, the region has no future.  I look forward to the Minister's response on the matter.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment and wish him well.  I thank Deputy Deirdre Clune for sharing time with me.If anything reflects the Pale mentality of the current Government, it is the decision on Cork Airport.  A commitment by Government announced by the previous Minister was alluded to by Deputy Clune.  It calls into question the value of a Government statement or a Government collective decision announced by an individual Minister, and the value of the programme for Government entered into by the PDs, the Green Party and Fianna Fáil, of which we have been advised, if commitments given are not honoured.The boardroom at Cork Airport is in turmoil and the main losers will be the travelling public who use the airport, which is a brand new facility and a tribute to everybody who contributed to its development, design and opening.  However, if the airport is not debt free, the costs for the travelling public will be much higher than they should be due to higher air fares and the availability of fewer destinations — in recent weeks a decision was made by Aer Lingus to withdraw the Cork to Madrid route, for example.  Other operators are not coming to Cork and other destinations will be dropped because costs will be higher for operators using Cork Airport.This is the consequence of the decision the Government has left with Cork Airport.  There is turmoil in the boardroom and this uncertainty does not serve the public in Cork well.  I appeal to the Government and to the Minister, at this late stage, to honour the commitments announced by the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Seamus Brennan.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	532	The State Airports Act 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports.  As part of the airport restructuring process the boards of Cork and Shannon airports are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.  Due to the fact they are interlinked, the production of the three airport business plans must be co-ordinated by the Dublin Airport Authority before being submitted to the Ministers for Transport and Finance for their approval under the State Airports Act 2004.   They must be satisfied that the airports have the capacity to operate on a sound commercial basis before giving final approval to the business plans.The Minister for Transport understands that the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has been advised by consultants on the appropriate financing proposal that would facilitate the statutory objective of the separation of Cork Airport from the DAA in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of the State Airports Act 2004 and the Companies Acts.  He is aware that the outcome of this analysis was that Cork Airport could sustain a certain level of debt while remaining a viable enterprise.  He understands that the board of the Cork Airport Authority also engaged consultants to further examine the issue of the Cork debt.The debt issue is crucial to the business planning process and must be addressed by the Cork Airport board and the DAA before any business plan is completed and submitted to the Ministers for Transport and the Marine and Finance.  The Government's position is that the funding of the new terminal and other works at Cork Airport must take account not only of what is commercially and financially feasible for Cork Airport but also what is commercially and financially feasible for Dublin Airport.If the Cork Airport Authority is to achieve autonomy in the foreseeable future, it must accept responsibility for a reasonable portion of the outstanding debt in return for the substantial assets to be transferred to it on separation.  In deciding what level of debt is to be borne by Cork, it must be manifest to all concerned that it is a manageable debt burden that would not put at risk the airport's commercial future.There remains a significant opportunity for Cork Airport to achieve the autonomy that the region needs and desires.  On behalf of the Minister for Transport and the Marine I urge all concerned to seize the opportunity for autonomy by recognising that a manageable debt burden is essential in order to make Cork Airport's independence a reality.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the issue of public transport services, particularly bus services, in the greater Dublin area, but it is unfortunate the Minister for Transport and Marine is not in the House to respond.  I raise these issues in the context of significant under provision of public transport generally within the area.We know it makes sense for all kinds of reasons — economic, social and environmental — to encourage and facilitate as many people as possible to use public transport.  In the past, the need was to convince people of that argument, but now they fully accept it.  The issue now is the Government's inability to provide adequate public transport to meet the demand.  It is clear from the length of bus queues during the morning and evening peaks and the cramming of people into buses, trains, the DART and the Luas that the demand far outstrips supply.  This is the challenge for the Government, but it has failed in this regard in recent years.Late last year the Government finally allowed Dublin Bus to acquire the 100 additional buses that had been promised for years.  To date, only 40 of these have been put into service, leaving 60 brand new buses idle in garages around the city while people stand in queues waiting for buses to get them into or home from work.  This makes no sense.  This morning the Taoiseach said the reason was that there were not enough drivers.  This is not true.  Dublin Bus has been recruiting drivers for the past six months and has many new drivers ready and able to take up employment.  Unfortunately, Dublin Bus has not received the necessary approval from the Department to deploy the buses on the routes on which they are needed.  Dublin Bus proposes to introduce new routes, the 141 to serve the huge conurbation of Swords and the 128 for the north fringe and the housing development there.  People are demanding these services and Dublin Bus is ready to provide them but is precluded from doing so because the Department will not provide the necessary approval. It claims it has received requests from private operators, but there seems to be a serious ideological hang-up or log-jam in the system.  As long as an application from a private operator is under consideration the public bus company is not allowed to provide new services.  That does not make sense.  Those applications could be under consideration for nine or ten months or even longer because of the inefficient system in the Department.  Meanwhile people are left without services.Dublin Bus wants to use the Dublin Port Tunnel as a fast route into the city centre.  It has started to do this recently for the 41X bus, an express bus running from the Swords area into the city centre every morning.  Six buses operate on the route.  A total of 25 minutes could be cut off the journey time if the buses used the Dublin Port Tunnel.  As the buses are full by the time they reach Whitehall where they hit the traffic jams, they would not bypass passengers.  As express buses they should have a direct route into the city centre.The route has been provided at taxpayers' expense in the form of the Dublin Port Tunnel.  It is a fast, direct route and it makes sense for Dublin Bus to use it but because a private operator has submitted a request the Department of Transport and Marine will not allow Dublin Bus to do the sensible and rational thing.  I appeal to the Minister of State to give the message clearly to the Minister for Transport and Marine that people in Dublin cannot afford to wait any longer for decent bus services.  The buses and the drivers are in place.  They await only approval from the Department of Transport and Marine.  I urge the Minister to do the sensible thing, give those approvals and provide people with the service to which they are entitled.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment and wish him every success.In September 2006, Exchequer funding of €30 million was announced towards the cost of 100 additional buses for Dublin Bus.  Dublin Bus took delivery of these buses in 2006.  These additional buses enable Dublin Bus to expand the number and frequency of services throughout its network to the benefit of customers across the Dublin Bus network.  As a result up to 8 million additional passengers are expected to be carried each year.The deployment of these buses across the network is an operational matter for the company.  Since the arrival of the new buses, the company has commissioned and introduced 42 into service in areas such as North Wicklow, Tyrrelstown and Finglas, Skerries, Portmarnock and Malahide.Dublin Bus has informed the Minister for Transport and Marine that the balance of the new buses will be commissioned and in operation in time for the peak period from September next when demand is greatest.  Areas to benefit in the coming months include the Merrion Road quality bus corridor, the Ballymun quality bus corridor, Blanchardstown, Finglas, Meakstown etc.The only area where Dublin Bus has been advised it is not in a position to proceed with a new service is the route 141 from Swords to the city centre via Drumcondra.  This is because the company must await a decision on a prior application from a private bus operator for a licence for bus services along the route.  In the past year, the Department of Transport and Marine has received a total of 76 notifications from Dublin Bus to initiate or amend services.  Of these 56 were noted and therefore authorised, three were withdrawn by the company, two were advised they would require section 25 applications, three have been deferred due to a prior application from a private operator and one service has been part approved and is now in operation.  The Department, however, has deferred a decision on some bus stop elements of that proposal and 11 notifications have been received in the past three months and are being processed in the normal way in respect of other routes across the city.  As can be seen from this data, most Dublin Bus service changes have been approved.Since January 2001, Dublin Bus is required to give at least four weeks' advance notice to the Department of Transport and Marine about proposals to initiate new services or to alter its existing bus services.  The purpose of this procedure is to ensure a level playing field between Dublin Bus and private operators in the authorisation of service changes.  Dublin Bus is also subject to compliance with the requirement of the provisions of section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 concerning competition with licensed private operators.There is no delay in clearing Dublin Bus notifications where there is no conflict.  However, where the proposed service change is judged likely to compete with an existing licence, the application may be refused or a decision deferred until the prior application has been finalised.  In accordance with standard regulatory procedures, the prior application from the private bus operator, made under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, has to be considered first.  Once the licence application has been processed, the Department of Transport and the Marine either clears the notification or Dublin Bus is asked to review its proposals in the light of the licence issued to the private operator for the route in question.  Under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958, Dublin Bus also has the option to seek the Minister's consent for the initiation or amendment of services operated so as to compete with a licensed passenger road service.  These procedures are adopted in the interest of an orderly approach to the regulation of the bus market and considered to be of benefit to Dublin Bus, private bus operators and the consumer.The use of the Dublin Port tunnel by Dublin Bus on a regular basis for its services is subject to the company complying with the requirement to give formal notification to the Department of Transport and the Marine.  So far, the company has only formally notified the Department of its wish to use of the port tunnel for three of its services.  Approval has been given, without delay, for two of these services and Dublin Bus is now operating routes 33X and 142 through the tunnel.The third proposal from Dublin Bus for use of the Dublin Port tunnel is for changes to four of the existing services on the 41X route and no extra services have been sought which would require the deployment of extra buses.  Dublin Bus has been informed that a decision on the proposed 41X changes has been deferred because the Department of Transport and the Marine has a prior application from a private operator to provide a commercial express bus service, without State subvention, from Swords to the city centre, via the port tunnel.  Deliberations on this application are at an advanced stage.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I join my colleagues in congratulating Deputy Howlin on his recent election to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I also thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to address this issue tonight.  It concerns an emerging crisis in Dublin 15 at both primary and secondary level.  I particularly want to discuss the secondary school crisis in Castleknock, a suburb of Dublin with a population of 40,000 and only one secondary school.  It is clear from the numbers attending the primary schools within the catchment area that by 2009 the 210 places available in the school each year will not be adequate.  They are already not adequate but by 2009 at least 90 local children will be turned away from their local school.  The direct responsibility for this lies with Fianna Fáil and, in particular, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, who, as recently as last year, told us in written answers that an additional school was not needed in Castleknock.  As a result of those answers, attempts by me and other councillors to reserve a site in the Fingal county development plan were thwarted.  I hope the Minister of State, in his response tonight, treats this issue with respect.  I do not want to hear about Hansfield, Tyrellstown or Phibblestown, any more than I want to hear about schools in counties Westmeath, Kilkenny and Carlow.  I hope he will address directly the secondary school crisis in Castleknock.I have four simple questions which I hope the Minister of State will answer.  First, does the Department accept its responsibility for allowing this crisis to develop?  Second, has it acquired a site and, in particular, entered negotiations with Castleknock College, the local fee-paying school, with regard to acquiring a site?  Third, will the Minister commit to establishing a new school, even if it has to be on a temporary site, by 2009, regardless of whether a site can be acquired?  Fourth, will the Minister commit to appointing a provisional board for the new school before the end of the year?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the actions being taken by the Department of Education and Science to address the post-primary school accommodation needs of the Dublin 15 area.  The Department is conscious that Dublin 15 is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country and, as a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for primary school places in the area.  A range of extra primary school accommodation has or is being put in place to address this need.  The knock-on effect of this development is expected to start manifesting itself at post-primary level from 2008 onwards.  There is currently spare capacity in two post-primary schools in the Dublin 15 area, namely, Riversdale community college with 150 spare places and Blakestown community school with 350 spare places.  In the circumstances, the Department is satisfied that there are sufficient places to cater for needs in the short term, even though every pupil may not secure a place in the school of first choice.For the medium term, the Department is advancing plans to make 4,000 extra post-primary places available in the Dublin 15 area.  It has already given the go-ahead for the delivery of a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school in Phibblestown.  This new school will be delivered, with new schools for the rapidly expanding areas of Donabate and Laytown, under a design and build contract.  The Department is working with the relevant parties on the delivery of these projects within the earliest possible timeframe.  It has also reserved a site for post-primary provision in the Tyrrelstown area of Dublin 15.  It is likely that this school will also be a 1,000 pupil facility.  The educational reservation in the Hansfield strategic development zone also allows for the development of a post-primary school for up to 1,000 pupils.  A project manager has recently been appointed to oversee the development of educational provision on this site.With regard to Castleknock specifically, the Department is working closely with Fingal County Council to identify a site for the development of a new post-primary school.  Once acquired, a timeline can be set for the delivery of a building.  Consideration will also be given to an early start-up of the new school once the Department is satisfied that the use of all other accommodation in the area is being maximised.In the coming years the Department will be delivering four new post-primary schools in the Dublin 15 area.  Apart from the considerable extra primary provision also being made, this will represent a massive and unprecedented capital investment in the area.  The Department is keenly aware of the need to deliver this infrastructure in line with demand and is working assiduously to achieve this.  It will also continue to keep the situation in the area under review and to work with the local authority to ensure any other emerging needs are addressed as quickly as possible.I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter in the House.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 78 together.The final out-turn on Vote expenditure for the Health Service Executive, showed a capital saving of €114m of which €42m was used to offset a revenue overspend and a further €47m was used to offset a shortfall in projected Appropriations-in-Aid.   This left a balance of €25m to be surrendered to the Exchequer.The Health Service Executive's Appropriation Account for 2006 will show an overall surrender of €365m — the €25m capital and €340m in respect of the Long Stay Repayment Scheme.  Unspent capital funding can not automatically be transferred from one year to the next.  However, under Section 91 of the Finance Act, 2004, Government Departments and the Health Service Executive may apply to carry over up to ten per cent of any net underspend on the capital Vote to the following year.  If approved by the Minister for Finance, provision for such carry over is made in the Appropriation Act for that year.However, the HSE was not in a position to provide a firm projection of its net capital expenditure saving for 2006 within the prescribed time limit.  As a result, the Appropriation Act 2006 does not include any provision for the carry over by the HSE of its €25 capital saving.  The HSE has taken steps to strengthen its capital management capacity, including the establishment of a single national Estates function and the appointment of a new Director of Estates.  The level of capital funding provided to the HSE for 2007 will support a continuing high level of investment in our public health services and will enable the completion and commissioning of many new acute and community health care facilities.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 83, 102, 120 and 145 together.I wish to state at the outset that, by the end of this year, there will be substantially more staff working in delivering frontline health care services than at the start.  In this context, discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to new posts required this year to reflect policy initiatives and service developments throughout the health service.It is a long-standing feature of the public service that both pay levels and serving numbers have been subject to a range of control mechanisms to manage Exchequer costs. The Government needs to have available to it a clear understanding of both the numbers and grade make-up of the various sectors of the public service. Such information is vital in circumstances where the Government is seeking to manage its overall fiscal, particularly expenditure, policy and in assessing future public service pension liabilities.In December 2006 a revised employment ceiling for the health service of 108,000 expressed in whole time equivalents was sanctioned.  This represented an increase of 10,450 over the previous approved ceiling.  In conveying this sanction, the HSE was asked to ensure that staff costs are controlled and managed to best effect, that an appropriate balance is achieved between clinical and non-clinical posts, that there is a better skill mix within the clinical areas and that staffing levels provide cost-effective and safe/quality care to patients.Sanction for the revised employment ceiling of 108,000 was, however, subject to the condition that a revised employment ceiling of 107,000 would apply with effect from the end of 2007, i.e. an implicit reduction of 1,000 posts is to be secured through better management of staff resources.  This represents an effort to increase efficiency of staff resources by less than 1 per cent, even as staff levels for service developments are being increased substantially.I am aware of ongoing, routine discussions between the HSE and Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin in relation to budgetary performance.  As part of these discussions the hospital has been advised of its requirement to deliver services in line with the Service Plan and to operate within its employment ceiling.  The HSE is working closely with the Hospital with a view to ensuring that the delivery of services  is in line with the Hospital's Service Plan and that the Hospital operates within its employment ceiling.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	539	Asthma is not a notifiable disease and consequently, detailed information on its incidence in the general population is not routinely available.  From the research available in this country, however, asthma is a common childhood condition with approximately 10% having experienced an attack of asthma.  Similar to other European countries, the level of asthma has increased and is now approximately 20% in young teenagers.There are a variety of risk factors for asthma, including environmental and genetic factors.  In recent years, the Health Research Board has funded a number of proposals relating to asthma and respiratory disease.  Legislation on smoking at work has also provided greater protection from toxic tobacco smoke which contributes to asthma.  There is a major international research effort underway to identify risk factors for asthma.   Ireland's involvement included the European Union's Joint Research Council initiative on childhood asthma and the co-ordination of an EU approach under the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2004.  Ireland has participated in international prevalence studies on asthma and there is ongoing work on the development of information systems on asthma.I have no plans to include asthma in the Long Term Illness scheme.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI scheme can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €85 per calendar month, or approximately  €20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The National MRSA Reference Laboratory is operated by St. James's Hospital.  It is a purpose-built facility that provides an essential national support to the overall HSE effort in dealing with the problem of MRSA through a range of services.  The current budget for the Laboratory is just over €270,000.  Plans for expansion of its operation and resources have been submitted to and are under consideration by the HSE which provides the funding.  Tackling Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) including MRSA is a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).  I share the public concern in relation to MRSA.  The HSE recently launched its ‘Say No to Infection' action plan and a new HCAI Governance Group was established.  This Group will manage the HSEs approach to tackling HCAIs including MRSA and is responsible for reducing infection levels in Ireland's healthcare facilities.  The Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams to ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the targets set down.Over the next three to five years the plan aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings and to reduce and alter antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Group has already agreed a detailed Infection Control Action Plan.  This Plan involves a number of targeted actions, based on best practice, that will be delivered across the healthcare system.The HSE has clear hygiene and infection control standards, has undertaken initiatives on reducing antibiotic consumption and education of the public and of health professionals, including a T.V. and media campaign.  In addition, the HSE is currently appointing a number of new infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists.  These staff will strengthen specialist support for infection control and facilitate the development of the national surveillance system.  I have also instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contract MRSA.  While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.

The Government has recognised this by providing an additional €2.5m in both 2006 and 2007 for the service.  This has resulted in an increase of 50% in the funding for this service.  In addition, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has provided additional capital funding to ensure that quality standards are put in place and maintained by voluntary groups.   Meals on Wheels is generally provided on the basis of grant payments by the HSE to voluntary groups which in turn undertake the day-to-day management and delivery of the service.The HSE also provides a range of other supports to the voluntary groups through the community workers in each Local Health Office area, their Environmental Health Officers and their community nutrition service. For example, training has been provided on food safety and hygiene, healthy eating and financial management.  Service Level Agreements are now in place with the larger organisations who deliver this service and Community Work Departments have provided training to voluntary management committees on standards, guidelines and financial management of the service.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 104, 114, 152 and 156 together.I am familiar with the approach being adopted by the Health Service Executive in seeking to improve safety and standards across the acute hospital network in the North East Region, having regard to the issues raised in the Teamwork Management Services Report — "Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East".  The Teamwork Report includes a number of recommendations to improve patient care in the region.  It particularly highlights the need to develop a high quality, responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards.  It recommends that there be one major regional hospital in the North East, supported by the five existing local hospitals.  The new hospital is to provide emergency and trauma services on a 24 hour basis and also provide planned specialist procedures that are complex and require the facilities of a large regional hospital.The hospital reconfiguration process is being overseen by the HSE Steering Group which is leading the project.  No decision has been made to date on the location of the new regional hospital. A sub-committee of the Steering Group was established to progress the issue of site selection.  Following a tendering process, the HSE appointed consultants to carry out an independent site location study. The study, which the HSE expects to be finalised in August, will take account of various criteria including demographics, access, planning and development considerations and interdependencies.The specific issues relating to the criteria for the selection process and submissions relating to the new hospital are a matter for the HSE.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to have these issues investigated and to reply directly to the relevant deputies.The first step in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure that the people of the North East have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life saving emergency care.  Over the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency in-patient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, services at the existing five hospitals will continue to be improved.   My Department has been advised that the existing hospitals will continue to provide services which meet the majority of health needs of the community.The HSE has given me an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of the Teamwork Report, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place. The HSE advises that the implementation plan will involve some level of redeployment of existing staff, including the 48 staff referred to, but that the plan will result in an increase in the overall number of staff in the region.

The completion of the first stage of the project will increase the bed complement from 215 to 244.  This phase includes the fit out of the existing ward shells, the refurbishment of the existing paediatric and obstetric wards and an interim Special Care Baby Unit.   The HSE has advised that the fit out of the existing ward shells is scheduled for completion by the end of September. These wards will then be utilised to facilitate the completion of the refurbishment of the existing paediatric and obstetric wards and the development of the interim Special Care Baby Unit.The second stage of the project, which proposes to increase the bed complement to 324, is estimated to cost in the region of €48 million.  It includes a new Acute Psychiatric Department, an Intensive Care Unit, a new Medicine for Elderly/Rehabilitation Unit, increased capacity in the Medical Assessment Unit and increased capacity for day procedures.In accordance with Department of Finance requirements, any capital project in the Health Sector costing more than  €30 million requires a detailed cost benefit analysis.   My Department is advised by the HSE that this analysis has now been completed in respect of the second stage of the Phase 2B development at Mullingar and is due to be considered by the Executive shortly.

This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy to build on the improvements we have made in recent years, particularly the improvements in survival in all the major cancers.The HSE, at my Department's request, is conducting a national needs assessment for cancer control which will set out priorities in the medium term.  I have made available an additional €20.5m this year for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes €3.5m to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  The Programme will manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  It will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.The Service Plan of the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the Programme.  This includes the establishment of the leadership team to implement the Programme, including the Director of the Programme and key medical leaders at network level.  I wish to see the appointment of a Director as soon as possible and my Department is in discussions with the HSE to expedite such an appointment.

Subject to overall parameters set by Government the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In this regard, it is a matter for the HSE to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.The HSE has recently commissioned a comprehensive review of maternity and gynaecology services in the Greater Dublin Area. This review will include an evaluation of current capacity, usage and deployment of consultants, midwives, beds, neonatal care, theatres, outreach clinics, home care, emergency facilities, diagnostics, gynaecology and other services provided. An independent report will be produced which will make recommendations on the optimal configuration of primary, community and hospital services for safe, sustainable, cost effective and high quality maternity services.The Government has invested heavily in the education and training of these professions to provide for the healthcare needs of the population. I provided funding for a new direct entry midwifery degree programme which commenced in six higher education institutes in autumn 2006. This programme will reduce the time it currently takes to train midwives.   There are 140 places available on this programme each year.  The post registration midwifery programmes are also continuing. The current two year post registration midwifery programme is to be replaced by an 18 month programme in autumn 2007 which should make it more attractive to potential candidates.  There will be 154 places available on this programme nationally. The combination of the direct entry and post registration programmes will increase the supply of midwives in response to existing and anticipated future workforce needs within a changing health service.

The HSE monitors the level of elective activity in each acute hospital.  A month on month comparison of elective activity for 2006 compared with 2005 was carried out by the HSE and it did not indicate any significant change in the proportion of elective work.  The analysis also suggested that elective activity had not suffered as a consequence of the focus on managing A & E performance.The National Hospitals Office (NHO) of the HSE is responsible for the collection and publication of performance data on acute hospitals nationally. The  NHO has been implementing a system across all NHO hospitals during late 2006 and 2007 to collect a range of performance monitoring data, including information on cancellation rates. Depending on hospital systems, start dates for collection of this information has varied across the hospitals.  My Department has requested the HSE to furnish as much information as possible to the Deputy in the matter.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The well-being of older people living in nursing homes is of critical concern.  Formal standards are a key requirement for inspection and registration.  The present standards for nursing homes are set out in the 1993 Care and Welfare Regulations and the Health Service Executive (HSE) inspects private nursing homes on the basis of these standards.   In 2006 a HSE Working Group produced a report on nursing home inspections and registrations.  Last July the Executive began a phased implementation of all the Group's recommendations.  There is now in place a national standardised approach to nursing home inspections across the system and this currently underpins the inspection process.The HSE has made important improvements to its nursing home inspections process since the Working Group report was completed.  It has been working to standardise the reports and has engaged with the nursing home inspection teams and with the private nursing homes sector.  It is now putting in place dedicated Nursing Home Inspection Teams.  All inspections are now unannounced and nursing homes are now inspected at least twice a year.  All inspection reports are now available on the HSE website. The Government has allocated an extra €6m for the further development of the nursing home inspection process in 2007-2008.The HSE has advised my Department that the principal expertise involved in inspections is that of medical, nursing and environmental health professionals.   Staff are currently employed on both a full time and part time basis and the position can be summarised as follows: In HSE West, there are 6 teams comprising of 6 Medical Officers, 6 Nursing Staff, 9 Environmental Health Officers (WTE) and 2 Clerical Officers undertaking inspections in Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary, Donegal, Roscommon, Mayo Galway and Sligo/Leitrim; in HSE South, there are 9 teams comprising of 9 Medical Officers, 9 Nursing Staff and 9 Environmental Health Officers undertaking inspections in Cork -South Lee, North Lee, West, and North, Carlow / Kilkenny, South Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Kerry; in HSE Dublin North East there is one centralised team covering Dublin North East, Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan.  The team comprises of 2 Medical Officers, 7 full-time and 2 part time Nursing Staff and an Environmental Health Officer as required; in HSE Dublin Mid Leinster there are 9 teams consisting of 10 Medical Officers, 19 Nursing Staff, 7 Environmental Health Officers and 10 Therapists undertaking inspections in Dublin South City, Dublin South West, Dublin South East, Dublin West, Dublin South/Dun Laoghaire, Wicklow, Kildare/West Wicklow, Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath.  Donegal, Limerick and Dublin North East teams work full time on the inspection process.  The remaining teams consist of staff working on inspections part time.  Forty additional posts have been approved since the beginning of 2007 and the majority of these posts have now been put in place.  The approach in the implementation of these new posts is being tailored to meet the needs of each area.Finally I would like to advise the Deputy that the Health Act 2007 provides for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority on a statutory basis.  It also provides for the registration and inspection of all nursing homes — public, private and voluntary.  Inspections will be carried out by the Social Services Inspectorate, part of HIQA.   The HSE is liaising with HIQA to facilitate this and transition arrangements will be agreed as we move towards the new system of inspections which will be governed by HIQA in line with the recently enacted legislation.

The position at 15th June, 2007 was that 3,200 offers of repayment, with a value of approximately €60m have been issued by the scheme administrator. Arising from these offers approximately 1,800 repayments with a value of approximately €38m have been made to date.  The rate of repayment is lower than had been projected. I understand from the HSE that this is due to a number of factors including the legal and technical requirements, a high level of deficiencies in the application forms submitted to the scheme administrator and complexities in the operation of the probate process. In accordance with the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, priority has been given to repaying living applicants as they were most immediately affected, however repayments to estates have now commenced.A dedicated website, an information phone line and an e-mail facility have been established by the scheme administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 9.00 am and 6.00 pm Monday to Friday.  The helpline has dealt with over 50,000 queries to date. The HSE is monitoring the operation of the repayment scheme and has agreed a range of initiatives with the scheme administrator to speed up the repayment process. The closing date for receipt of applications is 31st December 2007 and I have been informed by the HSE that final repayments should be made by mid 2008.

I have recently met with the organisations representing the consultants, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation, and both organisations expressed their willingness to resume talks within the context of the chairman's proposed framework.  I have also met with Mr Connaughton and I am hopeful that the talks process will get underway again shortly and will be concluded by early Autumn.In relation to consultants engaging in private practice I would like to emphasise that all patients, whether public or private, and subject to clinical need, should receive equitable access to care provided by consultants on public hospital campuses and public community facilities. Where private practice is carried out on public hospital campuses/community facilities, it must not compromise patients' access to consultant-provided care and must be compatible with an equitable and efficient allocation of public funds. In this regard management has already proposed two variants of a new contract:  Type A whereby consultants will not receive private fees and Type B where consultants will have access to private practice on-site within agreed parameters.I would like to remind Deputies that the current consultants' contract needs to be reformed in order to achieve the following objectives: a consultant-provided rather than a consultant-led service; greater flexibility in consultants' work practices and working times; a clearly defined commitment by consultants to the public hospital system; the introduction of consultant team-working as the norm; enhancement of the role of consultants with respect to managerial and financial accountability; a more pro-active and strategic role for consultants in the supervision, education and training of NCHDs; and more effective planning and monitoring of consultants' services.

This will provide inter hospital comparisons which will drive best practice in this important area.

It has been estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.The Health Service Executive  received an additional €10m in funding in 2006 to enable the establishment of up to 100 Primary Care Teams in development; a further €22m is being provided in 2007 to meet the full year costs of the 2006 developments and to enable a further 100 Primary Care Teams in development to be established.  The Government has committed under the Towards 2016 agreement to the establishment of 300 Primary Care Teams by 2008; 400 by 2009; and 500 by 2011.  A review of these targets will be undertaken in 2008.The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the Health Service Executive, having regard to a number of factors.  These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matters raised by the Deputies.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have replies issued directly to the Deputies.

Phase One of the campaign was launched in March 2007 with the launch of a TV advert campaign both here and in Northern Ireland. Development of Phase Two of the campaign is being led by the National Office for Suicide Prevention and commenced with launch of a national public attitudes survey on mental health in April, 2007. The aim of the campaign is to develop, in conjunction with voluntary organisations, a national multimedia campaign to combat the stigma of mental health and to encourage the seeking of help.

The report found that there was limited follow-through on the obligations set out in the contract concerning clinical audit. The report indicated that consultants have a pivotal role to play in this area and consequently future contractual arrangements should address the obligations of the respective parties and the mechanisms through which clinical audit will be implemented.I am advised by the Health Service Executive that a significant amount of clinical audit is already undertaken by consultants and their teams in the hospital setting. Currently the National Hospitals Office is developing a framework for quality and risk management  and continuous quality improvement across the acute hospital sector. A comprehensive programme of clinical audit, that includes involving professional groups in multi-professional clinical audit, will be one of the key elements of continuous quality improvement in the framework.Earlier this year I launched the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance which will advise on the most appropriate systems for patient safety, including the participation by all health care staff in audit programmes which will aim to ensure quality improvement. The Commission is expected to report mid-2008.

While the exact duration of the investigation cannot be fixed, it is predicted at this stage that HIQA will complete their Report by October 2007.  In the case of the second person named by the Deputy it has not yet been decided whether it might be necessary for HIQA to initiate an investigation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I wish to state at the outset that, by the end of this year, there will be substantially more staff working in delivering front-line health care services than at the start.  It is a long-standing feature of the public service that both pay levels and serving numbers have been subject to a range of control mechanisms to manage Exchequer costs. The Government needs to have available to it a clear understanding of both the numbers and grade make up of the various sectors of the public service. Such information is vital in circumstances where the Government is seeking to manage its overall fiscal, particularly expenditure, policy and in assessing future public service pension liabilities.In December 2006 a revised employment ceiling for the health service of 108,000 expressed in whole time equivalents was sanctioned.  This represented an increase of 10,450 over the previous approved ceiling.  In conveying this sanction, the HSE was asked to ensure that staff costs are controlled and managed to best effect, that an appropriate balance is achieved between clinical and non-clinical posts, that there is a better skill mix within the clinical areas and that staffing levels provide cost-effective and safe/quality care to patients.Sanction for the revised employment ceiling of 108,000 was, however, subject to the condition that a revised employment ceiling of 107,000 would apply with effect from the end of 2007, i.e. an implicit reduction of 1,000 posts is to be secured through better management of staff resources.  This represents an effort to increase efficiency of staff resources by less than 1 per cent, even as staff levels for service developments are being increased substantially.

Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputies in relation to the matters raised.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	560	The Deputy may wish to know that while the main emphasis will continue to be on providing supports that help older people to remain in their own home for as long as possible, additional long-stay residential places will be required in the coming years to meet the needs of an ageing population. Last year, the HSE, in conjunction with Prospectus, undertook a Needs Assessment of bed capacity requirements in the areas of long-stay, dementia specific and respite care beds. This report was submitted to the Department of Health and Children in September 2006. While the report indicates a small national surplus of long-stay beds, it also notes that this surplus masks the uneven distribution of beds between and within regions. In particular, HSE Dublin North east and HSE South have an immediate requirement for additional beds. This shortage is being addressed by the measures outlined below.In 2006, the HSE contracted a total of 1,050 extra beds in the private nursing home sector. A total of €28m is being allocated to cover the full year cost in 2007 of these beds. In addition, the HSE hopes to contract a further 350 beds in 2007 at a cost of €12m. 220 of these will be procured in the Greater Dublin area and 100 will be procured in HSE South.The HSE also proposes to expand public capacity by 397 beds in 2007 and by 408 in 2008. This expansion will take account of the regional variations identified in the HSE/Prospectus report. The running costs in full year of this additional public capacity will be €42m. According to the overview document for A Fair Deal there is a total of 9,488 beds in public nursing homes including Welfare Homes of which about 8,250 are long-stay beds. Approximately 7,415 older people currently occupy public long-term care beds. Overall between public and private residential facilities there are currently 21,200 older people in long-term residential care nationally. This equates to 4.6% of the over 65 population nationally.As well as the provision of domiciliary services to support older people to remain living in their own homes, quality residential care facilities will be available to provide, not only long stay beds, but also assessment, diagnostic, rehabilitation, day care and respite services to help prevent hospitalisation and/or admission to long-stay care.

The figures are provided on a net basis showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive's database e.g. following a review of an applicant's circumstances.As of 1st June 2007, 1,243,466 people held medical cards. This is 98,383 more people than in January 2005 (1,145,083). As of 1st June 2007, 68,208 people held GP Visit Cards. Approximately 31% of the current national population qualify for free GP services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	562	In line with commitments made in the Health Strategy 2001, Quality and Fairness — ‘A Health System For You', work is underway on a new legislative framework to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility and entitlement for health and personal social services. The aim is to produce a clear set of statutory provisions that ensure equity and transparency and to bring the system up to date with developments in service delivery and technology that have occurred since the enactment of the Health Act 1970. It is intended that the heads of a new Bill will be brought to Government during 2007.Additional funding has also been made available in recent years to allow for additional persons to become eligible for the medical card and free access to GP visits for those on low income. During 2005 for example, significant changes were introduced making it easier for people to qualify for a medical card or GP visit card.  The income guidelines and the income allowances for children taken into account for the purposes of assessment of eligibility for the medical card were increased by 7.5% from 1st January, 2005. A further increase of 20% was made to the income guidelines for medical cards and GP Visit Cards in October 2005. In June 2006, the income guideline for GP Visit Cards, a 25% differential over the new medical card income guideline, was further increased to 50% in excess of the guidelines.As of May, 2007, the number of people with a medical card was 1,241,331 and an additional 64,690 people held a GP Visit Card. 1.31 million people have free access to a GP through the General Medical Services Scheme.Since the publication of the Health Strategy, the number of in patient beds and day care places available for use has steadily increased by an average of 300 beds per year. There was around 1,150,000 in-patient and day case discharges from acute hospitals in 2006. Since 2001, in-patient discharges have increased by in excess of 6% and day cases by 55%. In addition, the National Treatment Fund arranged for the treatment of almost 17,000 patients in 2006 bringing the total treated by the fund since it was established in 2002 to 54,890 patients.The Primary Care Strategy is also being implemented by the HSE, at an operational level, since 2005 and the establishment of 100 Primary Care teams is well underway. These teams will further develop capacity for the delivery of services at local level as part of a modern health system that is accompanied by specific initiatives such as GP Co-operatives, physical infrastructure and upgrading of equipment in support of the Strategy.Finally, the policy objective behind the hospital co-location project is to free up private beds in public hospitals in order to improve access to acute services for public patients.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	563	I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 139 together.The final out-turn on Vote expenditure for the Health Service Executive, in 2006, shows a capital saving of €114m of which €42m was used to offset a revenue overspend and a further €47m was used to offset a shortfall in Appropriations-in-Aid.   This left a balance of €25m to be surrendered to the Exchequer.   The Health Service Executive's Appropriation Account for 2006 will show an overall surrender of €365m, €25m capital and €340m in respect of the Long Stay Repayment Scheme.  In 2005 there was an overall surrender of approximately €79m.  The capital programme had a saving of €50m, non-capital programmes saved €4m and Appropriations-in-Aid showed a surplus of €25m.With regard to expenditure to-date in 2007, the latest figures available from the Health Service Executive report total expenditure to the end of May as being approximately €4.8 billion against projected expenditure of €4.77 billion.  Within these figures the trend in expenditure is much the same as in 2006.  The capital spend is behind that planned, while the non-capital is running ahead of budgeted spend.  I will be discussing corrective action with the CEO as a matter of urgency.The capital programmes submitted by the HSE in each of the three years, and approved by me, included sufficient projects to absorb its capital allocation for each year.  However, actual capital expenditure in 2005 and 2006 turned out to be less than had been planned.  In relation to the HSE's capital programme, 2006 was a year of significant transition for the HSE with the establishment of improved arrangements for the planning, implementation and monitoring of the programme.  The HSE's Capital Plan for 2006 included a large number of projects across the health sector, many of which were characterised by relatively low levels of required capital investment.As the year progressed, the HSE endeavoured, where feasible, to introduce substitute projects to compensate for any projected availability of funding arising from slippage on the intended capital programme. The eventual year-end saving on capital expenditure arose mainly from a lower level of progress than anticipated on a range of intended projects, combined with the transition to the new capital monitoring and management structures introduced by the HSE during the course of the year.The HSE has taken steps to strengthen its capital management capacity, including the establishment of a single national Estates function and the appointment of a new Director of Estates.  The level of capital funding provided to the HSE for 2007 will support a continuing high level of investment in our public health services and will enable the completion and commissioning of many new acute and community health care facilities.

I indicated publicly at that time that I would shortly be signing an Order establishing the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on a legal basis.  I recently signed the legal instrument giving rise to the legal establishment of the Board.  I met with the Development Board last Monday when it held its inaugural meeting.The principal function of the Development Board will be to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new National Paediatric Hospital in accordance with a brief to be approved by the Health Service Executive.  The brief, which is being finalised, will set out the preferred model of care, the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and the additional range of services to be provided outside the main hospital, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children's hospital services.The HSE is being advised in this context by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Ltd., an established UK-based healthcare planning company.

A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of physiotherapy graduates.  Training places for physiotherapists have increased by 134% (from 64 to 150) while the number of physiotherapists employed in the public health service has risen by 130% (from 593 to 1364) since 1997.The provision of additional physiotherapy services through developments in a number of service areas has been prioritised in recent years.  A number of additional physiotherapists will be employed as a result of additional funding provided for new developments in 2006 and 2007.  Additional physiotherapists will be required, for example, for the extension of the home care package scheme, the development of primary care teams and networks and the enhancement of the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services in the disability sector.However, I am aware that a situation emerged whereby some 2006 physiotherapy graduates had difficulty in obtaining employment in the public health service.  My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, undertook to address this situation in a proactive manner and made significant progress in creating employment opportunities for these graduates.  In this regard, my Department is continuing to chair a working group comprising representatives from the HSE, the therapy managers and IMPACT.  The Group has identified the contributing factors and has developed an action plan with a view to addressing these factors to minimise similar difficulties for 2007 graduates.  The group is now working through prioritised actions and continues to make progress on several key actions.I understand that the HSE is reviewing the current panel for basic grade physiotherapists with a view to establishing a new basic grade physiotherapy panel as soon as possible.  As a result of the proactive approach taken by my Department and the HSE, I understand that a large majority of the 2006 graduates are now employed.

Additional funding of €5 million was announced in Budget 2007.  This funding is being used to improve palliative care services in consultation with the newly established Regional Development Committees.Also in 2007, my Department will be working with the HSE on developing a paediatric palliative care policy in line with the Report.  The HSE, which is now charged with the operational responsibility for delivery of healthcare services is also committed to a number of further initiatives this year including rolling out the Minimum Data-Set for Palliative Care Services and agreeing a framework for National Standards for Palliative Care with the relevant stakeholders.In relation to the National Cancer Control Strategy, the aim of the Strategy which was published in June 2006, is to reduce our cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality rates relative to other Member States of the European Union.  This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy to build on the improvements we have made in recent years, particularly the improvements in survival in all the major cancers.The HSE, at my Department's request, is conducting a national needs assessment for cancer control which will set out priorities in the medium term.  I have made available an additional €20.5m this year for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes €3.5m to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  The Programme will manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  It will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.  The Service Plan of the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the Programme.  This includes the establishment of the leadership team to implement the Programme, including the Director of the Programme and key medical leaders at network level.

In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive (HSE) a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.In assessing eligibility, the HSE uses national guidelines to assess people's means, which includes their income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of  other factors which may impact on people's ability to meet the cost of GP services.  Under the assessment arrangements, persons whose sole income is derived from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the assessment  guidelines, qualify for a medical card.  Since January 2005 to June 2007 an additional 166,591 people have free access to GP services.  This figure consists of an additional 98,383 people with a medical card and a further 68,208 people with a GP visit card.I have no immediate plans to change the guidelines used in the assessment process.  However, my Department and the HSE monitor the number of medical cards and GP visit cards on an ongoing basis and the need for changes to the guidelines is kept under review, having regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes to the various social welfare schemes.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	579	The Deputy's question mainly relates to human resource management within the Health Service Executive.  I am very aware of the unique challenges faced by employees across the Health Sector, including social care workers, as they carry out their duties.  Assault in the workplace is a phenomenon which needs to be taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.  I know that a joint working group was established in February 2006, under the auspices of the Health Service National Joint Council, to examine and report on the matter of tackling violence and aggression against staff in the workplace.  The terms of reference for the group are to produce a standard policy for the health service on the management of violence and aggression in the workplace, having regard to the body of work currently available within the Health Service Executive and its agents and to best international practice generally.As the processes in place to deal with and record assault rates would be a matter for the Executive under the Health Act 2004, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have it investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

This audit is scheduled to be completed in early Autumn.  In addition an audit of the implementation of the existing cardiovascular health strategy ‘Building Healthier Hearts' is being finalised by the HSE.  While these audits will inform the development of cardiovascular and stroke services, my Department considers that there should be an over-arching policy framework to set out the broad policy guidelines for development of policy on cardiovascular disease including stroke.  My Department is therefore in the process of establishing a national working group to draw up a such a policy framework.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	581	There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.  I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.  My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.While considerable work has taken place to develop arrangements which would ensure that no top-up charges are applied, it is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements and the process by which they are arrived at comply with the terms of the Competition Act 2002.  In this context consideration is being given at present to the most appropriate way in which to put in place contractual arrangements for the provision of services by self-employed health professionals.My Department does not compile statistics on the number of chiropody professionals practising in the State.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that the Health Service Personnel Census for end March 2007 returns 33.42 Chiropodists in wholetime equivalent terms.  As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the other matters raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	582	I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Report Early Detection of Cancer: A Needs' Assessment of General Practitioners.  The key findings of this study are a need for increased patient awareness, community diagnostic facilities, improved communication with hospitals, further education and clinical practice guidelines on identification of early stage cancer, appropriate investigative pathways and referral criteria for suspected cancer, identification and screening of ‘high risk individuals' and elimination of inequity between public and private patients.Population based screening programmes are proven strategies in the early detection of pre-cancers and cancers.  I am fully committed to the roll out of BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Programme, and I have made available the necessary resources for this programme that will ensure national roll out beginning later this year.  I expect the roll out of the National Cervical Screening Programme, which will be available to every woman in the 25-60 age group, will take place around the end of the year.  Both screening programmes will be available without charge.  I have also asked the National Cancer Screening Service to advise on the development of a population based colorectal screening programme and a colorectal screening programme for high risk groups.  I expect this advice later this year.  The service is required to implement special measures to promote participation in its screening programmes by disadvantaged persons.In relation to the development of GP protocols and equitable access to diagnostic services, these are key priorities of the National Cancer Control Strategy which is being implemented by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The HSE and the Irish Cancer Society also have education and awareness programmes in place on the early signs and symptoms of cancer.  The National Development Plan 2007-2013 will also support the implementation of the Strategy including infrastructural investment in diagnostic equipment and facilities to support improved access by general practitioners.

Tackling Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) including MRSA is a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The HSE recently launched its ‘Say No to Infection' campaign and as a result of this a new HCAI Governance Group was established.  This Group will manage the HSEs approach to tackling HCAIs including  MRSA and is responsible for reducing infection levels in Ireland's healthcare facilities.  Over the next three to five years the Group aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.The HSE has clear hygiene and infection control standards, has undertaken initiatives on reducing antibiotic consumption and education of the public and of health professionals, including a TV and media campaign.  In addition, the HSE is currently appointing a number of new infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists.  These staff will strengthen specialist support for infection control and facilitate the development of the national surveillance system.  I have also instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contract a HCAI or MRSA.MRSA is not a notifiable disease but the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE collects data on MRSA.  The data is collected on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter.  This system shows that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 592 cases in 2005 and 588 cases in 2006.  There are no figures available to date in relation to 2007.It is not possible to identify the number of fatalities attributable directly or solely to MRSA as most cases involve significant co-morbidity factors.  The State Claims Agency is dealing with a number of claims against the State which involve an element relating to MRSA.  However, the matter of liability in such cases has yet to be established.  In relation to the issue of overcrowding in hospitals, focused efforts under the Winter initiative scheme have achieved a reduction in the numbers of patients waiting for admission on trolleys in A&E and a reduction in the time those patients spend waiting.  Admission lounges have been put in place in a number of hospitals to ensure that patients are treated with dignity while awaiting admission.A number of new A&E Departments commissioned in 2005/06 have provision for minor injury clinics, including Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Cork University Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and St. James's Hospital.  In 2006, over 1,000 additional extended care places were provided through privately contracted arrangements.  In relation to 2007, the HSE has developed proposals to contract a further 450 beds in private nursing homes throughout the country.  There are also proposals for an additional 450 beds within the public system.  Additional home-care packages have been put in place to facilitate discharge from hospital to the patient's own home.  It is important that people do not remain in hospital any longer than is medically necessary.While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.  The Department of Health and Children will be monitoring and evaluating the progress being made by the HSE in the management of this issue so that patients can be assured that in the future the risk of contracting an infection will be reduced to the minimum level possible.

The HSE has advised that the infrastructural deficits identified in the seven hospitals referred to by the Deputy are being addressed through a combination of interim and long-term capital improvements and refurbishment.  The Task Force recommends that the issues in Emergency Departments be examined on a whole hospital and whole system basis.  It identifies the requirement for hospital specific initiatives as well as the development of national responses in relation to key structural issues.  A key requirement is the development of strong internal management control processes at hospital and community levels to ensure that capacity is fully optimised and that measures designed to unlock capacity are supported by strong controls which enable an appropriate balancing between emergency and elective workloads.My Department is assured by the HSE that a series of additional measures are being put in place to ensure the delivery of an improved service for patients and to reduce pressure on A&E Departments.  These include a series of hospital avoidance measures including:—Expansion of the Hospital in the Home scheme to the Dublin Academic Teaching HospitalsDevelopment of Community Intervention TeamsRoll-out of more primary care teamsExpansion of out-of-hours GP servicesExpansion of community diagnostic servicesMeasures being taken to improve and optimise acute hospital capacity and capability include:Seven new Community Nursing Units in DublinAdditional long-stay beds outside of DublinDevelopment of Admission LoungesAcute Medical Assessment Units at Navan and NaasAcute Medical Admission Units at Beaumont, Sligo and TallaghtDevelopment of enhanced diagnostic capability in hospitals

The National Office for Suicide Prevention was established by the Health Service Executive to oversee the implementation of the Strategy; to coordinate suicide prevention activities across the State; to consult widely in relation to the planning of future initiatives and to ensure best practice in suicide prevention.In 2006, an additional €1.2 million was allocated to the Health Service Executive specifically for suicide prevention initiatives.  A further €1.85 million has been allocated for 2007 bringing the total funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives on an annual basis to approximately €8 million.  This funding will be used to develop and implement national training programmes; to complete the availability of self-harm services through A&E Departments; to implement recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services; to support voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention and to support the World Congress on Suicide Prevention which is being held in Killarney this year under the auspices of the International Association for Suicide Prevention.The 2007 funding is also being used by the National Office for Suicide Prevention to implement a national positive mental health awareness programme.  Future funding will be considered in the context of the estimates process for 2008 and subsequent years.

The report provides additional supporting evidence for a new consultant's contract.  The report, inter alia, identifies the Government’s concern at the extent to which the level of private practice in public hospitals exceeds the 20% of designated beds in public hospitals.  There are 2,500 beds in public hospitals designated for use by the private patients of consultants.  However, as the report points out admissions to public hospitals of private patients of consultants on an elective basis (i.e. planned rather than emergency) make up about 35% of total elective admissions.  There is a need to ensure that a consultant’s private practice does not prevent or hinder access by public patients to public hospital services.I intend to give early effect to commitments in the Programme for Government to put public patients first and to ensure greater equality in access and care between public and private patients.  The interests of public patients must be protected and this requires an end to practices which serve to impede access for public patients and hinders effective hospital management.

I understand that the dialysis service in Limerick now runs on a seven days a week basis, working at maximum capacity, providing 277 treatments to 99 patients a week.  Five patients from the Mid-West area are currently receiving their treatment at neighbouring units as an interim measure until dialysis capacity is increased locally.Arrangements are well advanced to provide for increased dialysis capacity in Limerick in the short and medium term.  The HSE has invited tenders for the provision of additional dialysis services and is also working with the Irish Kidney Association in an effort to increase capacity locally.  Additional revenue funding of €12 million was provided to the HSE in 2006 and the current year to support the provision of dialysis facilities, the development of a living-related renal donor programme and the implementation of the National Renal Strategy, which is due to be published shortly by the HSE.  I understand that it will recommend the development of additional consultant led renal services on a regional basis.A number of new renal dialysis facilities have opened recently and others are due to open soon.  These include a nine station facility opened in St. Vincent's Hospital in 2006; eight new dialysis stations at Cork University Hospital which are due to open later this summer, and a 17 station unit being opened as part of the new hospital development at Tullamore.  This is due to open before the end of this month.  In addition 155 patients are now being treated in dialysis units operated by the private sector and 15 living donor transplants will take place this year in Beaumont Hospital.

Additional funding of €2 million has been allocated this year to build on the investment provided in 2006.I also asked the HSE to address in particular the identified deficits at the national adult referral centre at St. Vincent's University Hospital.  My Department is advised by the HSE that recent interim improvements at the hospital have resulted in additional capacity for persons with cystic fibrosis.  In addition, the HSE has approved the establishment of a Project Team to progress the next phase of the ongoing major capital development at St. Vincent's.  A new Unit for persons with cystic fibrosis has been identified by the HSE as one of a number of priority projects to be included in the development.In 2005, the HSE established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The Working Group has completed its work and its report is with the Executive.

It replaced three outdated maternity facilities in Cork — Erinville, St Finbarr's and the Bon Secours.  The approved midwifery staffing complement for CUMH is 376 WTEs.  There are currently 329 midwives in place.  The hospital is being commissioned on a phased basis to match the recruitment process.  There is a recruitment plan in place which includes the following—An ongoing national recruitment driveAn international recruitment campaignBack to Midwifery courses — one course completed in May and further courses are planned for later this summer.31 student midwives will graduate from University College Cork in September. These students have all been offered permanent midwifery posts in CUMH and to date 27 have indicated that they will accept the offer.Six theatre nurses commenced adaptation in early June and a further five midwives/neonatal nurses are due to commence in July.HSE South are optimistic that the full approved midwifery complement will be achieved by the end of this year.  The hospital opened with 128 beds on 31 March and this has now risen to 137.  When fully commissioned the hospital will have 144 beds.

This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy to build on the improvements we have made in recent years, particularly the improvements in survival in all the major cancers.The HSE, at my Department's request, is conducting a national needs assessment for cancer control which will set out priorities in the medium term.  I have made available an additional €20.5m this year for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes €3.5m to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  The Programme will manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  It will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.

As part of the overall investment package for the development of services for older people, the DOHC and the HSE have prioritised the delivery of additional public continuing care beds through the development of community nursing units in large urban centres in both Dublin and Cork together with the expansion and the development of additional facilities across all regions.  The HSE proposes to expand public capacity by 397 beds in 2007 and by 408 in 2008.  The running costs in full year of this additional public capacity will be €42m.In 2006, the HSE contracted a total of 1,050 extra beds in the private nursing home sector.  A total of €28 million is being allocated to cover the full year cost in 2007 of these beds.

The review of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI) Agreements, with the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, was completed in mid-2006 and the new agreements are in place.Following completion of the manufacturer agreements and in line with the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health, the State entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributor's Federation (PDF).  As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, the State intended to negotiate direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector, to address the cost of wholesale supply to hospital and community through fair, transparent and accountable cost structures.  In particular, the State wished to examine the high margin, relative to the EU, for wholesale supply to community pharmacy and the wholesalers' claim that they supply hospitals at a loss.Early in discussions, PDF refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply, based on its own legal advice.  Subsequent advice to the HSE, confirmed by the Attorney General's office and Senior Counsel engaged by the Attorney General, indicated that, under section 4 of the 2002 Competition Act, PDF as an association of undertakings may not collectively negotiate fees, prices or margins on behalf of its members.  Given this position, and the fact that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is also an association of undertakings, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins and such negotiations place these bodies at risk of prosecution.The State had intended to address the review of community pharmacy, and in particular how to improve value for money and transparency and fairness in relation to service provision, through negotiation with the IPU, as it had in the past, but this is no longer possible.  Accordingly, the negotiating team re-considered, in light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice, how best to address the review of pharmacy contractor services.  Following consultation with the IPU, a procedure was agreed to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  This process, chaired by Mr Bill Shipsey, SC, has commenced.The State continues to recognise the IPU as the representative body for its members, but negotiations with the Union must comply with the law.  The legal issues that emerged during the wholesale sector review were raised by the wholesaler representatives.  Once the State became aware of these issues, it was no longer possible to continue as intended.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU as the representative body for pharmacists, within the constraints of the competition legislation and the negotiating team will consider, in the context of competition law and in particular the relevant Competition Authority guidelines, all available options for advancing the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  I am satisfied that the Cabinet Committee process for review of the supply of drugs to the State is progressing effectively, within the constraints of relevant legislation.

BreastCheck appointed the Clinical Directors for the South and West last November and has recently appointed three Consultant Radiologists, two Consultant Surgeons and two Consultant Histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of Radiographers and other staff is underway.I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  The static units at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork and University College Hospital Galway are on schedule for hand-over in September followed by a three week commissioning period.  They will be operational in October.  In relation to the cost estimates for each centre, my Department has requested the CEO of the NCSS to reply directly to the Deputy.

ICT systems can also play a significant role in facilitating integrated team working and collaboration across service delivery settings as well as providing rapid access to clinical and administrative records and to a range of knowledge to assist with decision-making.A key aspect to achieving these advantages in the health service is the development of the Electronic Health Record (EHR). The National Health Information Strategy sets out the strategic direction for the EHR which will comprise a record of an individual's health from birth onwards. The strategy refers to such records being implemented on a phased basis and emphasises the potential benefits of this development across the health services in terms of patient safety and quality of care.  As per the Information Strategy, matters relevant to the development of the EHR are being examined in the context of the proposed Health Information Bill which will provide the legislative underpinning necessary to establish a health system wide information governance framework.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As of 1st June 2007, 68,208 people held GP visit cards. I should add that between 1st January 2005 and 1st June 2007 a net additional 98,383 medical cards were also issued.  The Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for the GP visit card and is the appropriate body to address the other issues raised by the Deputy. Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to have these matters investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	616	The well-being of older people living in nursing homes is of critical concern.  Formal standards are a key requirement for inspection and registration.  The present standards for nursing homes are set out in the 1993 Care and Welfare Regulations and the Health Service Executive (HSE) inspects private nursing homes on the basis of these standards.In 2006 a HSE Working Group produced a report on nursing home inspections and registrations.  Last July the Executive began a phased implementation of all the Group's recommendations.  There is now in place a national standardised approach to nursing home inspections across the system and this currently underpins the inspection process.The HSE has made important improvements to its nursing home inspections process since the Working Group report was completed.  It has been working to standardise the reports and has engaged with the nursing home inspection teams and with the private nursing homes sector.  It is now putting in place dedicated Nursing Home Inspection Teams.  All inspections are now unannounced and nursing homes are now inspected at least twice a year.  All inspection reports are now available on the HSE website.  I allocated an extra €6m for the further development of the nursing home inspection process in 2007-2008.The Executive has advised my Department that the principal expertise involved in inspections is that of medical, nursing and environmental health professionals.   Staff are currently employed on both a full time and part time basis and the position can be summarised as follows.  In HSE West, there are 6 teams comprising of 6 Medical Officers, 6 Nursing Staff, 9 Environmental Health Officers (WTE) and 2 Clerical Officers undertaking inspections in Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary, Donegal, Roscommon, Mayo Galway and Sligo/Leitrim.  In HSE South, there are 9 teams with 9 Medical Officers, 9 Nursing Staff and 9 Environmental Health Officers undertaking inspections in Cork -South Lee, North Lee, West, and North, Carlow/Kilkenny, South Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Kerry.  In HSE Dublin North East there is one centralised team covering Dublin North East, Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan.  The team comprises 2 Medical Officers, 7 full-time and 2 part time Nursing Staff and an Environmental Health Officer as required.In HSE Dublin Mid Leinster there are 9 teams consisting of 10 Medical Officers, 19 Nursing Staff, 7 Environmental Health Officers and 10 Therapists undertaking inspections in Dublin South City, Dublin South West, Dublin South East, Dublin West, Dublin South/Dun Laoghaire, Wicklow, Kildare/West Wicklow, Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath.  Donegal, Limerick and Dublin North East teams work full time on the inspection process.  The remaining teams consist of staff working on inspections part time.  Forty additional posts have been approved since the beginning of 2007 and the majority of these posts have now been put in place.  The approach in the implementation of these new posts is being tailored to meet the needs of each area.The Health Act 2007 provides for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority on a statutory basis.  It also provides for the registration and inspection of all nursing homes — public, private and voluntary.  Inspections will be carried out by the Social Services Inspectorate, part of HIQA.  The HSE is liaising with HIQA to facilitate this and transition arrangements will be agreed as we move towards the new system of inspections which will be governed by HIQA in line with the recently enacted legislation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	617	The most recent figures available from the National Cancer Registry show that there has been an increase in prostate cancer cases from 6037 to 9216 in the period 1994-1998 to 1999-2003.  The National Cancer Registry has informed my Department that most of this increase seems to be due to PSA testing, which is running at around 300,000 tests a year at present.  This has the effect of shifting diagnosis to an earlier age, which means that the cancer is being diagnosed on average about three years earlier in 1999-2003 compared to 1994-1998.  The most recent mortality data from the Central Statistics Office shows that the number of deaths from prostate cancer increased by an average of 0.5% per year from 1994 to 2004 but when adjusted for population increase and ageing the rate of change was a fall of 0.9% per year.The National Cancer Control Strategy does not recommend the introduction of a population based screening programme for prostate cancer as there is currently insufficient evidence available.  This position is consistent with the Recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for health care resources.  The EU proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.  My Department and the National Cancer Screening Service will keep emerging international evidence under review including the results of randomised trials that are currently being conducted internationally.Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at major hospitals throughout the country.  Any man who has concerns in relation to prostate cancer should contact his GP who will, where appropriate, refer him to the appropriate services in his area.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	618	The matter that the Deputy is referring to is the payment of subvention towards the cost of private nursing home care.  The cost of private nursing homes is set by the nursing home and is not determined by my Department. The subvention scheme was introduced to assist with the cost of private nursing home care and it was never intended that a subvention payment would meet the full costs of private nursing home care. The Regulations including limits on income and assets were introduced to ensure that available resources were directed to those most in need. These regulations apply to all applicants for a subvention.From 1 January 2007 there are no longer three separate rates for subvention. Persons who apply may receive any amount up to a maximum of €300 per week. The payment of subvention is subject to means testing. In addition, the HSE may pay an enhanced subvention to people who cannot afford to meet the cost of care. An extra €30 million has been provided in 2007 for this purpose.Earlier this year the HSE finalised National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme. Under the guidelines, the assessment of means will now be carried out using a national standard financial assessment method.The Government is currently considering new policy on Long Term Care and several principles underlying this were agreed with the social partners in "Towards 2016". These principles include, for example, that there should be one standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised.  Sheltered housing options will be encouraged.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility. The financial model to support any new arrangements must also be financially sustainable.The start date for the new nursing home support scheme — A Fair Deal — is 1 January, 2008. This is because primary legislation must be passed in order for the scheme to commence. The Department is currently working on preparing the Heads of the Bill.  Some of the benefits and key commitments to individuals as part of A Fair Deal will be:Nursing home care will now be affordable to every person and fair to all;For those currently in private care, their costs will be reduced;Individuals will be asked to make a contribution towards the cost of care, limited by the cost of care;The basis for contributions will be fair, based on each person's means and assets;A person's family will not have to contribute towards their cost of care;Care recipients will not have to sell or mortgage their house to meet the contribution;A spouse will not have to sell or mortgage the house to meet the contribution;The deferred contribution from the principal private residence will be capped at a maximum of 15%;Remaining spouse or partner will retain a minimum income of at least the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), i.e. €200 per week at present.Under the new scheme the State will continue to fund the largest part of care costs overall.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	619	According to the Health Infection Society's most recent survey of HCAIs, the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland is lower that the UK, including Wales.  The HSE recently launched its ‘Say No to Infection' campaign and as a result of this a new HCAI Governance Group was established.  This Group will manage the HSE's approach to tackling HCAIs, including MRSA, and is responsible for reducing infection levels in Ireland's health care facilities.Over the next three to five years the Group aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  These targets are being achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in health care settings and to reduce and alter antibiotic use in Ireland.The Group has already agreed a detailed Infection Control Action Plan for HCAI prevention and control including specific guidance for senior managers across all health care settings and local implementation teams to carry out the action plan.   This Plan involves a number of targeted actions that will be delivered across the health care system.  The various steps that need to be taken to tackle HCAIs are based on best practice and targets are based on evidence to be gathered from hospital and community health care settings.The reduction of health care associated infection (HCAI), including MRSA, requires a coordinated response including national and local implementation of strategies to reduce HCAI and antimicrobial resistance, continuous quality improvement initiatives in health care, surveillance of HCAI and antimicrobial resistance, education and training of health care staff and the public in the principles of HCAI prevention and control, and adequate resources to operate HCAI control and antimicrobial stewardship.  The HSE action plan incorporates all these important principles.  I am confident that this will lead to a significant decrease in HCAI over a 5-year period similar to the reductions experienced in other health care systems.

In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the number of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The most effective strategy for the prevention of cervical cancer requires decisions based on an assessment of the relative contributions of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination and cervical screening in reducing the burden of both existing and projected cervical pre-cancerous changes and cervical cancer.  Issues to be examined include the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the vaccine for different age groups and for differing levels of screening provision and uptake.  As is being done in other jurisdictions, Ireland is now considering the potential role of HPV vaccination in addressing the problem of cervical cancer prevention.The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has recently undertaken an scientific assessment of the public health value of HPV following a request from my Department.  NIAC and the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS), agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertake this study.  HIQA has recently been established on a statutory footing and one of the key functions of the Authority is the assessment of health technology, drugs and health promotion activities.  When I have received the policy advice from HIQA and NCSS I will make the necessary decisions that arise from the advice.A quality assured population based cervical screening programme aims to reduce cervical cancer in Ireland by approximately 80%.  I expect the NCSS to have such a programme in place from around the end of the year.  A national cervical screening programme will still be required regardless of a decision on a HPV vaccination programme.

I have been using the tax system to promote good environmental behaviour through the following policies:excise relief of over 200 million euro for biofuels over 5 years from 2006; 50% VRT relief for flexible fuel vehicles, hybrid cars and electric cars; the inclusion of recycling companies in BES/Seed Capital Schemes from 200; and extending the tax relief for corporate investment in renewable energy.In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, in my 2007 Budget Statement, I announced that I planned to introduce changes to the current VRT system to take greater account of environmental issues, and in particular Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions.  The Programme for Government re-affirms this commitment.  A public consultation in this regard has taken place.  Work on the matter is ongoing and a range of possible options are being considered at this stage.  It is intended that the changes made to the VRT system will be broadly revenue neutral.

Where a property is purchased jointly, each purchaser must satisfy the conditions in order to qualify for first-time buyers exemption.  This position has existed since the first-time buyers exemption was introduced.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The position is that the tax system does not provide relief in respect of private tuition expenses incurred by parents who have children with dyslexia.  The general issue of provision for children with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia, was discussed during the Finance Bill 2007 debates in the Dáil.  In recent years, the supports available through the direct expenditure system for children with disabilities, including those with dyslexia, have increased significantly.In 2005, approval was given for the Department of Education and Science to move from individual allocation of resources for children with special needs, on foot of a psychological assessment, to an approach whereby all schools are allocated resources based on a weighted model without the need for individual psychological assessments for the high incidence categories of need, such as dyslexia and mild/borderline-mild general learning disability.  In all, it is projected that over €820 million of the 2007 Estimates allocation for the Department of Education and Science will be related to disability and special needs.  As with many areas where State support may be required, the question arises as to whether such support may be more effectively provided through the direct expenditure route rather than through the tax system.  One advantage of the former mechanism is that the support may be better targeted at those in need, irrespective of family income, whereas support through the tax system can only benefit those whose incomes are high enough to benefit from tax relief.As I have indicated in response to previous Parliamentary Questions and representations on this issue, I have no plans to extend tax relief to cover expenses for tuition for children with dyslexia.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	640	The Government has introduced a number of measures to support parents with the cost of childcare and to increase the supply of quality child care places available to parents.  To stimulate the provision of quality childcare places the Government established the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme  2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP).  Together, the two programmes have a combined budget of almost €1.1 billion and are projected to create over 90,000 child care places, with some 34,000 of the new places already in place.  These places are provided either through community based/not for profit childcare groups or by private providers.Under the programmes applicants can apply for capital grants for the building or expansion of childcare facilities. The maximum funding available under the NCIP for community based services is €1.2 million and for private providers there is a maximum of €100,000 per facility and a maximum of €500,000 for multiple services in different catchment areas subject to programme criteria.Furthermore under the EOCP, community based providers have also been able to apply for staffing grants to assist with the costs of employing childcare workers in community based childcare centres with a focus on disadvantage.  This ensures that less advantaged parents have increased access to quality childcare and that they are charged fees which are less than the economic cost of providing the service.  Under the NCIP a successor scheme to support childcare costs for disadvantaged parents is being developed and is expected to be announced shortly.This Government is committed to providing enhanced childcare supports to ensure that there are quality services available to parents throughout the country while also offering real choice to all parents in relation to the care of their children.  In Budget 2007, the Minister for Finance announced the Government's commitment to invest an additional one billion euros in Child Benefit over the course of the next 5 years, to support all parents with the cost of caring for their children.  Child Benefit has been increased in successive budgets and in Budget 2007, it was increased by €10 per month for the first two children to €160 per month; and by €10 per month for the third and subsequent children to €195 per month.  The total cost of Child Benefit in 2007 is expected to be €2.258 billion.In addition, in Budget 2005 the Minister for Finance announced the introduction of  the Early Childcare Supplement of €1,000 per annum.  This is a direct, non-taxable payment of €250 per quarter year, in respect of each child less than 6 years of age.  The total cost of the Early Childcare Supplement in 2007 is expected to be €406 million.  Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement mean that a family with 2 children under the age of 6 years is now in receipt of a direct payment per annum of €5,840 at a total cost to the Exchequer of over €2.6 billion.To further support parents, major increases in Paid and Unpaid Maternity Leave was introduced in 2006 and 2007.  In March 2007 Paid and Unpaid Maternity Leave was increased in total by a further 8 weeks bringing the total duration of Paid Maternity Leave to 26 weeks and the total duration of Unpaid Maternity Leave to 16 Weeks.In relation to Value-Added Tax (VAT) the position is that the provision of pre-school childcare services is already exempt from VAT under the First Schedule to the Value Added Tax Act 1972 (as amended).  This means that such services are not subject to VAT.

The purpose of the consultation was to achieve consensus on an appropriate wording for an amendment to the Constitution which would reflect the need to establish robust safeguards and protections for children.On the direction of the Government, proposals were brought to cabinet by the Minister on a referendum to amend the Constitution in respect of Children's Rights and the Twenty-Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 2007 was published on 19 February 2007.In line with the Programme for Government, it is proposed to establish an all-party Committee to examine the proposed constitutional amendment with a view to further deepening consensus on this matter. It is envisaged that the published Bill will provide a framework for the work of the Committee.

Arising from these offers approximately 1,800 repayments with a value of approximately €38 million have been made to date.  This rate of repayment is lower than had been projected.  I understand from the HSE that this is due to a number of factors including the legal and technical requirements, a high level of deficiencies in the application forms submitted to the scheme administrator and complexities in the operation of the probate process.In accordance with the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, priority has been given to repaying living applicants as they were most immediately affected; however repayments to estates have now commenced.  A dedicated website www.repay.ie, an information phone line 1890 886 886 and an e-mail facility queries@repay.ie have been established by the scheme administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 9.00 am and 6.00 pm Monday to Friday.  The helpline has dealt with 50,161 queries to date.The HSE is monitoring the operation of the repayment scheme and has agreed a range of initiatives with the scheme administrator to speed up the repayment process.  The closing date for receipt of applications is 31st December 2007 and I have been informed by the HSE that final repayments should be made by mid 2008.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	646	An tÁrd Chláraitheoir, the Registrar General, is the person with statutory responsibility for the administration of the system of civil registration in Ireland.  I have made enquiries of an tÁrd Chláraitheoir and the position is as set out below.Section 46 of the Status of Children Act 1987 governs presumptions of paternity and non-paternity.  Subsection (1) of Section 46 provides that where a woman gives birth during a subsisting marriage, or within a period of ten months after the termination of the marriage, her husband is presumed to be the father of the child.  Subsection (2) of Section 46 provides that where a married woman who is living apart from her husband under a decree of divorce or a deed of separation gives birth more than ten months after the decree was granted or deed executed, her husband shall be presumed not to be the father of the child unless the contrary is proven on the balance of probabilities.Section 19 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 provides that when a child is born in the State, it is the duty of the parents or, if the parents are dead or incapable through ill health, another qualified informant to attend before any registrar, to give to the registrar the required particulars to register the birth, and to sign the register in the presence of the registrar.Section 22 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 provides for registration of the father's details where the parents are not married to each other.  Section 22(1) states that the father of a child who was not married to the mother at the time of the birth or during the period of ten months before the birth shall not be required to give information about the birth.  The remainder of this provision provides for the registration of the father's details, including circumstances where the mother was married to a person other than the father.  The effect of this provision is that where the parents are not married to each other, the father's details may be omitted from the registration of the birth.  If the parents, or one of them, want the father's details recorded, Section 22 sets out the procedures to be followed, including the requirement for a rebuttal of paternity where the mother is married to someone who is not the father of the child.It is understood that the person in question is in a subsisting marriage, but asserts that her husband is not the father of the child.  It is also understood that the person does not propose to enter the father's details in the birth registration.  As the person is in a subsisting marriage, the presumption of the paternity of her husband, as provided for under Section 46 of the Status of Children Act 1987, applies.  In order for the birth to be registered to exclude her husband's details, it will be necessary to obtain a rebuttal in writing from the husband stating he is not the father of the child.  When this rebuttal is to hand, the birth can be registered without delay.

Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A & E and do not require admission.The Health Service Executive continues to report significant improvements in the number of patients in A & E departments who are awaiting admission to an acute bed as compared with the same period last year.  The average number of patients awaiting admission during March, the last full month for which reliable information was available, was 59% lower than the equivalent period twelve months ago.Last year the HSE introduced a target of 24 hours within which all patients should be admitted, following the decision to admit.  This target is being achieved by the vast majority of hospitals.  The HSE is working closely with the small number of hospitals who are continuing to experience difficulties to assist them in reaching this target.  The HSE has announced that it will be introducing a revised target of 12 hours within which a patient should be admitted, following the decision to admit.  The HSE is also to introduce a monitoring system to record the total time patients spend in A & E departments, from the time they arrive to the time they are either discharged or admitted.In terms of A & E capacity the HSE has developed admission lounges at a number of hospitals in 2006 and further lounges are being fast tracked  to come on-stream in 2007.  These admission lounges alleviate pressure on A & E and enable patients awaiting admission to an acute hospital bed to be managed safely while preserving their right to dignity and privacy.  Other measures being put in place to improve services for patients and to reduce pressure on A & E departments include a series of hospital avoidance measures as follows:Hospital in the Home SchemeDevelopment of Community Intervention TeamsRoll-out of more primary care teamsExpansion of out-of-hours GP servicesExpansion of community diagnostic servicesMeasures being taken to improve and optimise acute hospital capacity and capability include:Seven new Community Nursing Units in DublinAdditional long-stay beds outside of DublinAdditional Acute Medical Assessment Units and Acute Medical Admission UnitsDevelopment of enhanced diagnostic capability in hospitalsThe Programme for Government commits to the provision of an additional 1,500 dedicated public beds.  In addition, the HSE is currently reviewing the acute hospital bed requirements up to 2020.  This review will identify the number and type of acute beds that are required, the capital and revenue implications, and advise on how to meet the identified need.  The findings and recommendations of this review will inform the Government's policy on developing capacity in acute hospitals into the future.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	670	I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions the background to the selection of the site for the new National Paediatric Hospital.The development of the National Paediatric Hospital is being overseen by a joint HSE / Department of Health and Children Transition Group.  The current stage of the process involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.  The brief is being developed for the Transition Group by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning company.  RKW is advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  They are advising, for example, on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital through the urgent/ambulatory care service, and on the location(s) for this service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children's hospital services.  Final consultations with stakeholders are being held this week in advance of the publication of the High Level Framework document.I recently signed the Order establishing the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on a statutory basis.  The principal functions of the Board will be to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new hospital in accordance with the brief approved by the HSE.  The Development Board held its inaugural meeting earlier this week.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 243 together.The Government's policy on radiation oncology is based on the Report on ‘The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland'.  The Report was prepared by a multi-disciplinary group of experts in radiation oncology, medical oncology, public health and palliative care, including significant expertise from St. Luke's Hospital and the Irish Cancer Society.  The Report has had significant international endorsement from such bodies as the US National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society.  The Report recommended that there should be two radiation oncology treatment centres located in the Eastern region, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas.  A detailed request for proposals issued to six hospitals in Dublin in June 2004 and an International Panel submitted its advice to me in January 2005.The decision to transfer St. Luke's Hospital was taken by the Government in the context of this advice and its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke's Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government's decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.  A transfer on similar lines took place last year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke's.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke's are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James's Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  The Chief Executive at St. Luke's will lead the management team of the new facility at St. James's.  I also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke's to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group which is advising me on progress on the implementation of the plan.Discussions on transfer, facilitated by the HSE, are taking place involving the Chief Executives of both hospitals.  A working group is in place to develop close working relationships and ensure a smooth transition.  In addition and in recognition of the role for St. Luke's in the new facility at St. James's, I will pursue discussions with the Boards of both Hospitals about its governance and a re-configuration of the Boards.  The twin goals are to ensure continuity of expertise and ethos in the care of cancer patients and the effective integration of multi-disciplinary patient care at the one site.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	672	The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of occupational therapists, general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists and others.It has been estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.The HSE received funding totalling €32m in 2006 and 2007 for the establishment of 200 Primary Care Teams, which altogether will involve the appointment of some 600 additional front-line professionals and thus a significant increase in capacity to meet people's health and social care needs in the community.  The Government is committed under the Towards 2016 agreement to the establishment of 300 Primary Care Teams by 2008; 400 by 2009; and 500 by 2011.  A review of these targets will be undertaken in 2008.The provision of the appropriate infrastructure for the effective functioning of the Primary Care Teams is considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors.  These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The Health Service Executive has established a project team to progress the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital. The new hospital will be built on its own campus and will retain its identity as a separate, therapeutic health facility owned and managed by the Health Service Executive. The new hospital will have its own grounds with a separate entrance and address to the prison complex.

Staff are currently employed on both a full time and part time basis and the number of teams for both 2006 and to date in 2007 can be summarised as follows:In HSE West, there are 6 teams comprising of 6 Medical Officers, 6 Nursing Staff, 9 Environmental Health Officers (WTE) and 2 Clerical Officers undertaking inspections in Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary, Donegal, Roscommon, Mayo Galway and Sligo/Leitrim.In HSE South,  there are 9 teams comprising of 9 Medical Officers, 9 Nursing Staff and 9 Environmental Health Officers undertaking inspections in Cork -South Lee, North Lee, West, and North, Carlow / Kilkenny, South Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Kerry.In HSE Dublin North East there is one centralised team covering Dublin North East, Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan.  The team comprises of 2 Medical Officers, 7 fulltime and 2 part time Nursing Staff and an Environmental Health Officer as required.In HSE Dublin Mid Leinster  there are 9 teams comprising of 10 Medical Officers, 19 Nursing Staff, 7 Environmental Health Officers and 10 Therapists undertaking inspections in Dublin South City, Dublin South West, Dublin South East, Dublin West, Dublin South/Dun Laoghaire, Wicklow, Kildare/West Wicklow, Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath.Donegal, Limerick and Dublin North East teams work full time on the inspection process.  The remaining teams consist of staff working on inspections part time.Forty additional posts have been approved since the beginning of 2007 and the majority of these posts have now been put in place.  The approach in the implementation of these new posts is being tailored to meet the needs of each area.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	675	I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 to 250, inclusive, together.The present standards for nursing homes are set out in the 1993 Care and Welfare Regulations.  The HSE inspects private nursing homes on the basis of these standards.  Inspections are carried out on an on-going basis and there is now in place a national standardised approach to nursing home inspections across the country, and this underpins the inspection process.  All inspections are now unannounced and nursing homes are now inspected at least twice a year.The HSE has advised that in 2006 there were 437 private nursing homes in operation across the country and they completed 870 inspections.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that since July 2006 the inspection reports have been made available on the HSE's website.  I am also pleased to say that I provided an additional €6m for the development of the nursing home inspection process in 2007/8.In addition to the work undertaken by the HSE on inspections, I published Draft National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in January 2007.  The standards, when finalised, will replace those set out in the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993.  Importantly, the new standards will apply to all residential settings (public, private and voluntary) where older people are cared for and for which registration is required.As the Health Act, 2007 provides that this enhanced inspection function will be taken over by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), I formally handed over the draft standards to the Authority to be finalised following a public consultation.  A wide ranging working group was immediately established by HIQA and the next step in the process will see the Authority publish their draft for public consultation prior to finalising the standards.   Regulations will then be drafted by my Department to give statutory effect to the new standards.The Chief Inspector of Social Services will then be required to monitor, against these standards set by HIQA, residential care services provided to older persons (amongst others) in public, private and voluntary settings.HIQA was formally established on 15th May 2007 and has received its allocation for 2007.  The staffing complement for the organisation including all of the posts for the Inspectorate has been agreed with my Department. I understand that HIQA is already in the process of recruiting its senior management team. Realistically the organisation must be given time to get its full complement of staff in place.The HSE is also liaising with HIQA to facilitate transition arrangements as we move towards the new system of inspection in line with the recently enacted legislation.

Regarding the regulations and requirements for helicopter operations operating to/from an open space in the proximity of a densely populated residential area, the IAA has informed me that the following requirements are in place:Articles 5(d) and 5(e) of Statutory Instrument S.I. No 334 of 2000 (Aerodromes and Visual Ground Aids) Order, as amended, (S.I. 216 of 2005), states that an aircraft shall not take off or land at any place in the State — “In the case of a rotorcraft any place where the aircraft may take-off or land without undue hazard to persons or property and in respect of which the owner or occupier shall have given permission”.Rule 2 of Statutory Instrument S.I. No 72 of 2004 (Rules of the Air) Order, states that "An aircraft shall not be operated in a negligent or reckless manner so as to endanger life or property".Aeronautical Notice 0.2 identifies the operating performance criteria for helicopter operations.Aeronautical Notice NR O.41 ‘Operation of Helicopters at unprepared sites' reinforces the regulations set out in both S.I. 72 of 2004 and S.I. 334 of 2000 while at the same time gives additional guidance on procedures to be followed at ad hoc landing sites.Operations Advisory Memorandum 08/2000 contains advisory information to ensure the safe and efficient operation of helicopters.In summary, the regulatory requirements are in place and are under constant review by the Authority and where necessary are amended to ensure that safety is not compromised.  The IAA has informed me that all the legislation relating to the regulation of helicopters can be viewed on its website, www.iaa.ie.  The IAA has further informed me that all complaints regarding the safe operation of helicopters or indeed fixed wing aircraft are investigated by the IAA where sufficient details of the alleged breach are available.  Individuals may contact the Authority directly with any concerns regarding safety matters arising from helicopter operations in their areas.  The IAA has advised me that they have not received a complaint regarding the specific incident referred to in the Question.  In this regard the Deputy or any individual can contact the IAA directly.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I assume the Deputy's question refers to market rights as defined under the Casual Trading Act 1995.  The 1995 Act sets out the law regarding selling goods in public places.  Casual trading is defined as "selling goods at a place (including a public road) to which the public have access as of right".  The activity is regulated by way of by-laws made by local authorities under section 6 of the Act.  The by-laws cover the functional areas of local authorities.  "Market Right" is defined in section 1(1) of the Act as "a right conferred by franchise or statute to hold a fair or market, that is to say, a concourse of buyers and sellers to dispose of commodities".  These market rights refer to markets and fairs created by statute or royal decree in the period from the Norman invasion to 1922.  In section 7 of the Act provision is made whereby local authorities can either by agreement or compulsorily acquire any market right in their functional area.  Provision is also made whereby if a market right has not been exercised for a period of not less than 10 years the market right shall stand extinguished.  Section 8 of the Act sets out the powers and obligations on local authorities in respect of market rights owned by them.  Whereas the previous casual trading legislation — the Casual Trading Act 1980, now repealed — excluded trading pursuant to a market right from the Act the current legislation covers trading carried out under a market right.  Therefore trading pursuant to a market right is subject to the by-laws in force under the Casual Trading Act 1995 in each local authority functional area.  These by-laws cover, inter alia, the designation of casual trading areas, the fixing of fees and the regulation of access to casual trading areas, etc.

Section 22 provides for a general rule that a statutory instrument made under other enactments can be revoked or amended even if those enactments do not contain an express power to do so.  In this context, the definition of a statutory instrument is very broad and in the time available it has not been possible to determine positively whether or not section 22 has been relied upon in respect of statutory instruments within my Department's sphere of responsibility.  Once my officials have established the position, I will revert to the Deputy.

It is designed to assist people on long-term social welfare payments and is not intended for the general population.  To qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and must be at least 21 years of age before commencing an approved course of study.  The person concerned is not in receipt of a qualifying payment and will not qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme.  The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and this eligibility criteria is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	691	The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April and are not intended to meet the full cost of heating.  Some 274,000 people benefited from the fuel allowance in 2006 at an estimated annual cost of €125.1million.  As a consequence of the increase in rate and the increase in the income threshold for eligibility as announced in the recent Budget, annual expenditure on the scheme in 2007 will increase by an estimated €36.4 million. The total annual cost in 2007 is estimated at €161.5 million.  Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to means and other conditions.  The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with a qualifying dependant.  People who already qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as old age (non-contributory) pension, long-term unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance.  Most people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.  However, from 29 September 2006 people in receipt of the State Pension can have earnings of up to €100 per week from insurable employment and still maintain their entitlement to fuel allowance.In the case of contributory pensions such as State pension (contributory), State pension (transition) and invalidity pensions which are not means tested, earnings from insurable employment and/or occupational pensions are normally regarded as means for the purpose of determining an individual's entitlement to a fuel allowance.  A person may have a combined household income of up to €100 per week, or savings/investments of up to €58,000, over and above the maximum rate of State pension (contributory) and still qualify for fuel allowance.  Any changes in the means rules for the scheme, would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.  In addition to the fuel allowance, some 340,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of €117 million in 2006.

Given the nature and range of statutory social welfare schemes provided for in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the regulations governing these schemes are, of necessity, amended on an ongoing basis.  In general, these regulations provide for Budgetary and other changes in these schemes such as increases in the weekly rates of payment.  Similarly, the statutory instruments made in accordance with the Pensions Act 1990 are reviewed, and, where necessary, amended to further strengthen the regulatory regime in relation to occupational pensions.  In progressing my Department's commitment to regulatory reform, a number of social welfare Statutory Instruments have been repealed, or repealed in part, since the commencement of the Interpretation Act on 1 January 2006.  Any such repeals were effected under the general regulatory powers contained in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, to which section 22 of the Interpretation Act 2005 applies, and were undertaken in the context of my Department's programme of legislation consolidation, and in the interests of better regulation generally.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	693	Part III of the Pensions Act 1990 is designed to protect the pension entitlements built up by employees in a company pension scheme in the event of the person leaving his or her employment.  The Act provides for the preservation of benefits accrued in an occupational pension scheme and the option for transferring such benefits to another pension scheme.  All occupational pension schemes, except certain public sector schemes, are required under the Pensions Act to provide for preservation of benefits.  Public sector schemes are exempt from these requirements subject to the condition that the benefits they provide for early leavers are no less favourable than those required by the Pensions Act.  The way in which preserved benefit is calculated depends on whether the scheme is a defined benefit scheme or a defined contribution scheme.  This preserved benefit is a proportion of the long service benefit to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had remained in relevant employment until reaching normal pensionable age and is calculated on an actuarial basis.  The Pensions Act also provides for the annual revaluation of such preserved benefits in relation to defined benefit schemes.Instead of availing of a preserved benefit in the scheme of the employment they are leaving, early leavers have a right to opt for a transfer payment to another scheme of which they are becoming a member or to an approved insurance policy or contract providing retirement benefits.  In addition a person may transfer to a Personal Retirement Savings Account provided they have not been a member of the pension scheme from which they are transferring for more than 15 years.  A transfer payment is the current cash equivalent, as calculated by the scheme actuary, of the preserved benefit to which the member would otherwise have been entitled.  The transfer value payable in respect of any preserved benefit from a defined benefit scheme may be reduced by the trustees of the scheme on the advice of the scheme actuary, if the scheme does not satisfy the Funding Standard under the Pensions Act.  This is designed to protect the viability of the scheme from which the person is transferring.  In a defined contribution scheme the transfer payment is the accumulated value of the appropriate contributions paid in respect of the member.  If an early leaver opts for a transfer payment to his or her new scheme, the trustees of that scheme must accept such payment and provide benefits equal in value to the amount of the transfer payment.  A person who is leaving a pension scheme should always seek advice on which option is the best for him or her.  The Pensions Board provide information booklets on the various aspects of the Pensions Act and they are available on the Board's website, www.pensionsboard.ie.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	694	The Scheme of Community Support for Older People is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.  The purpose of the Scheme is to assist and encourage the community's support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme.  A maximum individual grant of €300 is provided under the Scheme in respect of the once-off installation cost of socially monitored alarms.  The private commercial suppliers engaged by the community groups charge the ongoing monitoring costs that usually arise with such alarms.  I understand these costs are of the order of €80 per annum per individual, which equates to approximately €1.50 per week.  Given that the Scheme has benefited as many as 100,000 older people, the cost to my Department of providing funding for all such monitoring costs would be considerable.  It is my view that the available resources are better spent on continuing to improve the security of older people in their homes rather than paying for ongoing running costs and, accordingly, I have no plans at present to introduce a subsidy in regard to the monitoring costs for socially-monitored alarm systems.

The grant was to develop a youth work programme for Travellers in the Finglas area.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Dormant Accounts Fund cannot of its nature be regarded as a source of indefinite funding for specific projects.  However, I am keen to ensure that when projects which can demonstrate strong impacts in tackling disadvantage are coming to the end of their funding term, full consideration is given by relevant Departments to their possible mainstreaming.  To assist in this process, earlier this year the Government approved the allocation of additional Dormant Accounts funding to enable a limited number of projects, approved by the former Board under the initial round of funding, to continue for a defined period.  This funding will be targeted at certain projects that are awaiting decisions by Departments or Statutory Agencies on mainstreaming.  I understand that the project in question is among those which have recently been contacted with a view to making application for further Dormant Accounts funding in this context.

As a first step, staff from the integration unit of the Reception and Integration Agency will be moved to my Office.As Minister for Integration, I will have a clear cross Departmental mandate to develop, drive and co-ordinate integration policy across other Government departments, agencies and services.  In this context, I will have a close relationship with Ministers and policy makers in other Departments.My intention is to ensure that the development of a long-term national policy on integration will be informed by widespread consultation at a national level, properly structured objective research and international experience and best practice.Immigration matters are the direct responsibility for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  There are no plans at present to change this position, although of course the appropriate synergy will be maintained between immigration and integration policy issues.

Accordingly, an applicant wishing to sell will be unsuccessful if the price at which the quota is offered exceeds the Market Clearing price.In the case of the person mentioned, the quota was offered for sale at a price of 17 cent per litre.  The Market Clearing price on the exchange concerned was 16 cent per litre.  Therefore because the applicant's offer price exceeded the Market Clearing price, his offer was deemed to be unsuccessful.A further stipulation in the rules governing the Milk Quota Trading Scheme is that 30 per cent of all quota offered for sale is sold at a maximum price into the priority pool, for subsequent distribution to priority category producers.  This is the case in respect of all applicants, regardless of whether they are successful on the exchange.  The Trading Scheme is now being reviewed, and a third exchange will take place in the autumn.

To this end, my Department has prepared a draft Statutory Instrument and is in consultation with the Department of Health and Children with a view to making the necessary legislative change since the legal basis for any such legislation comes within the remit of that Department.  The legislation will also require clearance from the European Commission.I have also raised the issue in the Council of Agriculture Ministers and sought the support of EU Ministerial colleagues for EU-wide action on origin labelling.  In the context of a European Commission consultative process on the broad question of food labelling my Department has confirmed my strong preference for origin information for meat and the desirability of a common EU-wide approach to this.

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting an educational placement.  As there is an educational placement available to the pupil she does not qualify for tuition under the terms of the scheme.As the Deputy is aware a specific function of the National Council Special Education, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is to identify appropriate educational placement for all children with special educational needs. The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and school and is available to parents to provide support and advice.I understand from my officials that the SENO is currently liaising with the parents to progress the post primary options available to the pupil in question.

Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the methods used in special classes for children with autism.The issue of contention is whether ABA should be the only method used in some settings.  Advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS and the Inspectorate inform my Department's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one. An analysis of research — including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism — supports this approach too, while Autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method.By enabling children in special autism-specific classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, my Department is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.  In addition, children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.   Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.The National Council for Special Education will continue to expand the number of special classes for children with autism to meet demand.

It would be a matter for the Local Authorities to decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges. Where it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost would form part of the normal running costs of schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools have received from my Department.The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €163.58 with effect from 1st January, 2007. This represents an increase of over 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.Enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €418 to €805 per pupil. These were increased by an average of 30% recently. The capitation grant is in addition to the Ancillary Services Grant which provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme was increased from €102 per pupil in 2002 to the current rate of €145.50 per pupil.Under the new Programme for Government, we are committed to doubling the standard capitation grant for primary schools over the next five years. Grants to schools for the employment of secretaries and caretakers will also be increased significantly.

These are the Higher Education Grants (HEG) Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' (VEC) Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees (TLT) and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses (PLC). The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. In order to qualify for financial assistance under the Third Level Student Support Schemes operated by my Department, a person must pursue a full-time undergraduate course, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at an approved third level institution.Apart from the funding provided through the Student Support Maintenance Grant Schemes, financial assistance is also available from my Department for student with disabilities through the Fund for Students with Disabilities. The National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education administers this Fund on behalf of my Department.  This Fund aims to assist students with disabilities in third-level institutions and PLC colleges to participate in further and higher education.  Grants are provided for students who have serious sensory, physical and/or communicative disabilities.Applications for funding should be made on behalf of the student by the Disability Officer in the institution.  The student referred to by the Deputy should discuss their particular disability, and the equipment or services required, with the Disability Service in Sligo IT.

DEIS will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's Regional Offices and the Inspectorate.In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the School Support Programme were as follows:Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates)Junior Certificate retention rates by schoolJunior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS — "Overall Performance Scale" — score). This was based on each student's performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed bestLeaving Certificate retention rates by school.The identification process was in line with international best practice and had regard to and employed the exiting and most appropriate data sources available.A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.An application for review was received from the school referred to by the Deputy, but it was not among those schools recommended for inclusion in the programme.  As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included under the DEIS action plan. These comprise 670 primary schools and 203 second-level schools.Schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the DEIS programme will continue to be supported in their efforts to deal with educational disadvantage among their students.

Discussions with various providers have been on-going in this regard and I expect a final decision to issue shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	733	The Department is aware that there are extensive housing developments and population increases in the Swords, Skerries, Balbriggan and Lusk areas of Fingal and that this has led to increased demand for school places.Earlier this year, the Department published a Draft Area Development Plan setting out infrastructural requirements for the foreseeable future for the north Dublin, east Meath and south Louth areas.  This Plan covers the areas referred to by the Deputy.The Commission on School Accommodation has completed a public consultation process on the Draft Plan and it is currently consulting with both Local Authorities and school authorities.  It is the Commission's intention to complete and publish a final plan by late Summer.  When this is published, it will become the framework against which capital investment for the areas concerned will be made for the foreseeable future.  The Draft Plan shows that considerable interventions have already been made by the Department to increase pupil places in the areas concerned and that these interventions are being backed up by a significant capital investment programme.For example, at primary level in Swords, the Department is providing three new school buildings for Swords Educate Together NS, Gaelscoil Brian Boroimhe and Gaelscoil an Duinninigh. An extension is also being provided at St. Cronan's Senior NS, Brackenstown.  The Department has reserved three further sites in Swords for primary provision and is moving to acquire two of these sites immediately.  In Balbriggin, the Department granted recognition to Gaelscoil Bhaile Brigín, which commenced operation last year.In addition, St. Teresa's NS, Balbriggan is included among the schools recently given approval for the appointment of a design team to progress an extension project.The Department has also recently advertised for a Design Team for the construction of two brand new 16 classroom schools in Balbriggan.  One of these will provide a permanent school building for Balbriggan Educate Together N.S.  The patronage and management of the second school has yet to be determined.  There are a further two sites reserved in Balbriggan for primary school purposes and the Department will move to acquire and develop these as the need arises.At post primary level in Balbriggin, a new 1,000 pupil post primary school is being delivered under the Department's expanded Public Private Partnership process.  In Rush and Lusk approval was recently given to Lusk NS,  St. Catherine's NS, Kenure, and Rush N.S.,  to appoint design teams to progress extension projects.  Two sites have been reserved for further primary provision in Lusk, one of which is currently being acquired under the Fingal School Model process for the purposes of accommodating the Rush/Lusk Educate Together N.S.In Rush itself a site has also been reserved for primary school development.  In Skerries, the Department has reserved two sites for educational provision, one of which is currently being acquired under the Fingal School Model process to accommodate a new primary school to commence operation in September 2008 and to permanently accommodate St. Micheal's House Special School.  The totality of these interventions demonstrates both the awareness of the Department of the requirements of the areas concerned and its willingness to address these needs on an on-going basis.

The Department has instructed the County Council to acquire one of the sites as a matter of top priority for the purpose of providing both a new primary school and permanent accommodation for St. Michael's House Special School.It is the Department's intention to have suitable temporary accommodation in place on this site to enable the commencement of a new primary school for September 2008.  It is expected that the Patronage of this new school will be decided under the New Schools Advisory Committee process.

In recognition of this phenomenon, I announced earlier this year, the development of a new Patron model, with the VEC to act as Patron.  This suggested model has been broadly welcomed by the Education Partners.  Work on the development of a new Patron model is on-going within the Department in consultation with the Education Partners.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	736	The Programme for Government commitment in this area is for the long term funding for the existing centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable my Department to support them as primary schools for children with autism.In relation to specific provision for children with autism, my Department considers that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the methods used in special classes for children with autism.The issue of contention is whether ABA should be the only method used in some settings.  Advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS and the Inspectorate inform my Department's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one.  An analysis of research — including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism — supports this approach too, while Autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method.By enabling children in special autism-specific classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, my Department is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children. In addition, children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government. Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.The National Council for Special Education will continue to expand the number of special classes for children with autism to meet demand.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	737	In order to meet the language needs of students in our schools whose first language is not English or Irish, additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.  I indicated in January last that the limit of two teachers per school and the limit of two years' support to an individual pupil which had applied up to then, will no longer apply.  As a result, an individual school may be allocated up to six language support posts under the arrangements now in place.Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers. Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over €6,300, while schools with between 10 and 13 such pupils receive over €9,500.  Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years.  There are now approximately 1,450 language support teachers in our schools.  This compares with just 262 posts in the 2001/02 school year.In line with the Government's commitments under the ‘Towards 2016' partnership agreement, a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.  In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to schools assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT).  The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way.  The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.

This Order revoked the Irish Red Cross Society (Directions as to Ambulance Service) Order, 1955 which outlined that the Red Cross Society shall not ply for hire or advertise or offer the services of Red Cross ambulances on hire.I was advised at that time by the Office of the Attorney General that by virtue of the provisions of section 22(3) of the Interpretation Act, 2005 that I was empowered to revoke an Order made under section 6 of the Red Cross Act, 1954.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	739	The Defence Forces maintain a small ambulance fleet to meet their own needs.  These ambulances are primarily used to transfer Defence Forces patients to and between hospitals and to attend Risk Training Exercises. Risk Training exercises would include operational exercises, Artillery shoots, Infantry Support Weapons shoots and Live Battle practices.   In late 2005/early 2006 there was an investment of €850,000 on 6 road ambulances by the Defence Forces to replace an aging fleet.There are a total of 17 Defence Forces ambulances in service at present 16 of which are deployed across the country in the various brigades and 1 which is overseas, in Kosovo. One of these vehicles is located at the Defence Forces Training Centre at the Curragh Camp.The maximum speed permitted in the 6 new Army Ambulances is 90 KPH.  The vehicle is "governed" by the manufacturers (Ford Motor Company) to prevent exceeding this limit.  In order to implement this restriction a speed limiter, also known as a "governor", may be fitted to the vehicle.  There is a legal requirement that such governors are fitted, on import, as the vehicles exceed 3,500kg.  The Defence Forces decided when these ambulances were delivered in late 2005 not to interfere with the governor.  The vehicle is designed for a gross vehicle weight of 4200kg and taking into consideration the routine use of such vehicles for military purposes it was felt that 90 KPH was adequate.  Such "governors" are not on the older ambulances since they are lighter in weight and only require a Class A driving licence.  The new ambulances are much heavier in weight and require a Truck Drivers Licence.While these ambulances are for Defence Forces needs and are configured accordingly, arrangements exist between the HSE and the military authorities in three locations nationwide whereby the HSE receives very occasional support from the Defence Forces ambulance units.  These areas are Finner Camp, Co. Donegal, the Defence Forces Training Centre, the Curragh, Co. Kildare and Custume Military Barracks, Athlone, Co. Westmeath.  Ambulances from these locations are used on a very occasional basis to meet additional demands on HSE services.  The Defence Forces ambulance crews are under the direct control of the HSE ambulance service during their deployment in support of the HSE ambulance service.

It is understood that once refurbishment works are complete, Ratra House will be used by The President's Award-Gaisce and by the Office of Public Works.  Two members of staff have transferred to the OPW.My Department has agreed with the OPW and the Office of the President that it will retain the use of the Civil Defence training range, which is located to the rear of Ratra House.  Two staff of the Department of Defence are currently located on the training range to provide for its use and maintenance.  One member of staff is in Ratra House awaiting a transfer to another Government Department, which is remaining in Dublin.

Kildare.  The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200.It is understood that an application for planning permission for the construction of office accommodation in Newbridge for my Department's new Headquarters will be submitted shortly to Kildare County Council.  Depending on the outcome of the planning process, the Office of Public Works has indicated that construction and fit-out will take 18 months to complete.  It is not anticipated that any staff will move to Newbridge prior to the completion of the new building.Arrangements have been put in place by the Department of Finance whereby those staff who wish to remain in Dublin are offered posts under the ‘Dublin Arrangements' system operated by the Public Appointments Service.  To date, 27 of my Department's staff have volunteered for assignment to other Government Departments which are remaining in Dublin.The question of any severance package for those staff who do not wish to decentralise is a matter for the Minister for Finance.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	742	Following the Government decision on decentralisation announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement in December 2003, a Defence Forces Decentralisation Implementation Plan was produced on 28 May 2004.  This plan makes provision for the movement of approximately 413 military personnel currently employed within posts in Dublin to move to the Curragh with approximately 335 of those personnel being located at the new Defence Forces Headquarters building in the Curragh Camp. DFHQ Communications and Information Services Company and the Defence Forces Printing Press will be located in a separate new facility within the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh.  This new facility will cater for approximately 78 personnel.  In addition, a further 43 military personnel are planned to be co-located with Department staff in the Department's new headquarters in Newbridge.The terms and conditions of service of military personnel differ from public servants greatly.  The transfer of Defence Force personnel to the Curragh and Newbridge will be carried out under the terms of pre-existing Defence Force Regulations.  In these circumstances the move by military personnel to the new Curragh and Newbridge facilities will be on the same basis as normal transfers of military personnel and will not be voluntary.In addition to the above, in the order of 30 civilian employees are assigned to sections of DFHQ that are due to relocate to the Curragh Camp.  The move will be voluntary for the staff in these positions with the exception of 4 employees recruited to positions since December 2003 on the basis that they would, in due course, transfer to the Curragh Camp, Co. Kildare.  Of the remaining civilian employees assigned to sections of DFHQ that are due to relocate, I understand that 1 employee has expressed an interest in moving to the Curragh Camp.

There is also  a number of fixed camera installation posts at various locations in the Dublin area and the Louth/Meath Division. Three cameras are rotated between these posts, two in the Louth/Meath Division and one in the Dublin area.  I am informed that the mobile camera speed detection vans will be updated in the near future with digital technology and additional units will be brought into service.  In addition in-car camera systems will be fitted to Traffic Corps vehicles, a significant proportion of which will also incorporate speed enforcement equipment.The Garda Síochána also operate other speed enforcement equipment, including in excess of 400 hand held speed detection devices and car/motor cycle systems.The Garda speed enforcement capability will be enhanced significantly through outsourcing the operation of safety cameras to a private service provider.  Following a call for expressions of interest, six candidates were awarded pre-qualification status and have been issued with a detailed Request for Tender, with a closing date of 25 July 2007.  Following an evaluation process the successful tenderer will be selected on the basis of the tenders received and a contract will be entered into with the successful tenderer.As part of the Request for Tender, tenderers are being asked to indicate the equipment, including cameras, which they consider will be necessary to provide the service required.

The Conference provided an opportunity for a preliminary discussion of the wide range of policy issues identified in the Law Reform Commission's Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments which was published late last year. The Commission intends to publish a Report containing its definitive recommendations for reform later this year following completion of a consultation process.The Consultation Paper makes it clear that solutions to the difficulties arising in this area will require action across a broad range of policy areas, including the planning and development code, company law, consumer protection law and the development of regulatory structures. In recognition of this, and the cross-cutting nature of many of the issues, the Government has established a high-level interdepartmental committee to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive legislative response to the difficulties arising in relation to property management companies.The committee comprises representatives of the following Departments and Offices:Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment;Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government;Department of Finance;Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform;National Consumer Agency;Office of the Attorney General;Office of the Director for Corporate Enforcement, andOffice of Public Works.A key task of the committee is to identify the key legislative and administrative actions to be taken and to determine a timescale for implementation as soon as possible. In particular, the committee will have regard to the Law Reform Commission's definitive recommendations for legislative reforms in its forthcoming Report on Multi-Unit Developments.

She cannot therefore have an expectation, having been granted permission to remain on a self-sufficiency basis, to avail of State benefits and services which includes attending State funded schools.It follows that the child of an individual in the State on a self-sufficiency basis is not entitled to attend a public/non-fee paying school.  Should  such an individual wish to enroll their child in the schooling system they would have to do this through a fee-paying school or fee-paying institution.

Local Garda management is aware of complaints of anti-social behaviour in the area concerned and have directed that additional patrols by uniform and plain clothes Gardaí, including the local Community Policing Unit, the District Drugs Unit, the Mountain Bike Unit and supplemented by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Units, be deployed in the area, with a view to ensuring a concentrated and visible presence in the area.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of public order offences, the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents.  This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area.The Joint Policing Committee for the Dublin City Council area and its subcommittees, established under the Garda Síochána Act 2005, provide forums where members of the City Council and senior Garda officers, with the participation of Oireachtas Members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of an area including the levels and patterns of anti-social behaviour such as that referred to by the Deputy.

His application was refused at appeal stage following consideration of his case.The person concerned was informed by letter dated 26 November 1999, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations received on his behalf from his legal representative for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 11 May 2000, my predecessor refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of him.An application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child was made circa August 2002 and refused by letter dated 22 April 2004. An application under the IBC/05 Scheme which introduced revised arrangements for the processing of claims for permission to remain in the State from the non-national parents of Irish born children was refused by letter dated 19 January 2006.An application for revocation of the deportation order in this case is still under consideration in my Department. I expect to be in a position to make a decision on this matter shortly.

Section 184 amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to the public order offences of disorderly conduct in a public place and intoxication in a public place as an alternative to proceedings being taken in the first instance (and for the prescribing of the penalty).I am informed by the Garda authorities that work on the necessary arrangements for the introduction of these provisions as soon as possible is progressing.Policing arrangements for public events and in locations generally, along with the allocation of Garda resources, are a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Where such events take place the Garda authorities work closely with local residents in order to avoid as far as possible disruption to local communities.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that every effort is made by local Garda management, on the occasions of major match days or events, to ensure appropriate attention is afforded to public order offences.  Gardaí on duty on such occasions are pro-active in dealing with any attendant problems arising.  In addition, Garda patrol vans are also on patrol to assist in addressing public order offences.

The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006 and for the first quarter of 2007.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to her.

Her asylum application was refused by the Refugee Application Commission and this decision was upheld by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  She applied for residency on the basis of marriage to an Irish National and this application was refused by my Department on the 21/11/2005.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, she was informed by letter dated 21 November 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.

An undertaking was received from the owner that these practices would cease and local Gardaí are satisfied that this undertaking is being honoured.I am also informed that local Garda management has directed that particular attention be paid within the Garda District concerned by Garda foot and mobile patrols to such parking of vehicles.  The Garda authorities have requested the local authority to have in excess of twelve vehicles removed, none of which local Garda management attribute to the business in question.I am advised by the Garda authorities that specific complaints regarding particular vehicles left abandoned, uninsured or untaxed will continue to be investigated and appropriate action taken, including requesting the local authority to remove the vehicles.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	769	Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, a development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.Development Plan Guidelines for Planning Authorities, published on 8 June 2007, provide that the development plan must offer clear guidance on sustainable development policies and objectives, both national and local, and address the various issues involved, including land use and transportation.  Development plans are required explicitly to address the inter-relationship between land use and transport by setting out aims for the achievement of sustainable travel patterns, reducing reliance on private car usage and promoting public transport, as well as other sustainable modes (cycling, walking).My Department is also advancing new Planning Guidelines on Residential Density including an Urban Design Manual.  Both these documents will place considerable emphasis on the need for the design and layout of new residential development to be optimised in such a way as to strongly encourage the development and usage of environmentally sustainable forms of transport such as public transport, walking and cycling.Finally, my Department is working with the Department of Transport and the Marine to ensure close linkage between future planning guidance and the work of that Department in promoting sustainable transport.

In addition, the new Commission on Taxation will be specifically charged with investigating fiscal measures to protect and enhance the environment, including a carbon tax.The proposals included in Budget 2007 to rebalance the motor tax system in favour of cars with lower CO2 emission levels have been the subject of public consultation.  Following evaluation of submissions from interested parties, I intend to proceed with suitable measures to incentivise the driving of cleaner cars.

It is intended that a contribution will be made to an appropriate fund to secure verified emissions reductions equivalent to the annual emissions associated with Government air travel.  The Programme for Government notes that this scheme should support urban forests.  My Department is currently developing proposals in this regard.

The Commission will monitor and assess Ireland's progress in addressing climate change and increase awareness in all sectors of the opportunities and challenges presented by the transition to a low-carbon economy. It will report annually to Government through an appropriate Cabinet Committee.  Arrangements are currently being made for the establishment of the Commission.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	773	I am carefully considering the form which the review of regional waste management plans provided for in the Programme for Government should take.  It is important that the review is properly structured so as to make a lasting contribution to the manner in which Ireland undertakes waste management planning and the achievement of international best practice in this area, while meeting challenging national objectives and EU requirements.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	774	The Programme for Government commits to the setting of new ambitious waste management targets for maximum prevention, re-use, recycling and modern waste treatment to ensure that we match the best performance in the EU for recycling with the objective that only 10% of waste or less is consigned to landfill (down from 66% now).Irish waste management policy is based on the internationally recognised integrated approach which places the main emphasis on waste prevention, reuse and recycling.  This approach is now delivering demonstrable and successful results. In 1998 Ireland had a recycling rate of just 9% but this had risen to 35% by 2005, reaching a national target set for 2013.  Our recycling of packaging waste over the same period rose from 15% to 60%, thus exceeding the 50% EU target set for 2005 and reaching the EU 2011 target.The Government is determined to build on these achievements and I will be giving this matter priority over the coming months.  The review of regional waste management plans provided for in the Programme for Government should also better equip Ireland to achieve these ambitious targets.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	775	The waste management plans for which local authorities have statutory responsibility, generally operating in regional groupings, identify the landfill capacity which those authorities consider necessary to meet the needs of each region while meeting national and EU objectives and requirements.  My Department does not compile details in respect of existing or proposed facilities and all such facilities are required to be licensed by the EPA. In the context of the demanding landfill diversion targets established by the EU Landfill Directive it is clear that a significant move away from our current reliance on landfill is essential.  I anticipate that this will be borne out by the international review of the regional waste management plans which is provided for in the Programme for Government.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	776	Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).Regulations transposing the European Communities (Access to information on the Environment) Directive 2003/4/EC were signed and came into effect on 1 May 2007.The process to transpose Directive 2003/35/EC is already well advanced with legislation already completed to amend a range of consent systems.  The remaining work will be finalised by the Departments concerned at the earliest possible date.Having regard to the above, I will ensure that the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention is submitted to Government and laid before the Dáil as soon as possible.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	777	A considerable amount of preparatory work has been done in my Department to develop proposals for the consolidation and modernisation of current national monuments legislation.  The enactments relating to the protection of archaeological heritage date from 1930 to 2004 and need to be consolidated and updated to take account of current and future circumstances.  In doing so account will also have to be taken of the consequential implications for other statutory codes, including the Roads Acts and the Planning Acts.I intend to review this matter in the coming months, with a view to submitting new legislative proposals to Government for approval.  Before doing so, I wish to consult the various interested parties, to ensure that we produce a modernised and effective code that gives the highest possible priority to the protection of our archaeological heritage, to which I am fully committed.  Arrangements for these consultations are being put in place.

I have requested my Department to liaise with UNESCO in relation to this designation.Tara is not one of the sites on the tentative list for World Heritage status prepared by a Departmental Committee following public consultation before I became Minister.  However I will keep the issue of seeking designation for Tara under review.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	779	I propose to take Questions Nos. 359, 360 and 362 together.The statutory role of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in relation to an approved road development lies in the issuing of directions as to how works of an archaeological nature are to carried out on the approved route.  The recent issuing of the statutory directions in this case arose in circumstances where a national monument was discovered during the carrying out of M3 road development subsequent to its approval by An Bord Pleanála, and neither that approval nor the Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the scheme dealt with the newly discovered monument.I first knew of Minister Roche's directions when I received a text in this chamber on the evening of Thursday 14 June.  Neither I norany of my party colleagues had any prior contact with Minister Roche on this issue.  On 15 June 2007 following my appointment as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I examined my Department's file in relation to the directions given to the National Roads Authority (NRA) regarding the National Monument discovered at Lismullin, County Meath on the approved route of the M3 motorway.  The directions had been made on 12 June 2007.In issuing directions in this case, the then Minister followed the procedures prescribed under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004.  These included the required consultation with the Director of the National Museum.  The advice from both the Director and the Department's Chief Archaeologist indicated that excavation of the National Monument at Lismullin was the preferred archaeological approach in the circumstances of this particular case.  Based on this advice the directions issued by the then Minister required the NRA to fully excavate and record the National Monument.The Act of 2004 also provides that where the Minister has issued directions to a road authority, the road authority shall inform An Bord Pleanála of those directions and of any change to the road development, which it is satisfied is necessitated by the Minister's directions.  It is a matter for the road authority to determine if any such changes are necessary as a consequence of such directions.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	780	Before directions issued in this case under the National Monuments Acts, the Director of the National Museum of Ireland (NMI) was consulted as required by law and offered detailed comments by way of written submission.  The issues raised by the Director in relation to the National Monument discovered at Lismullin were considered and taken into account in finalising the directions which issued.In his letter the Director agreed that the scale and comparative rarity of the monument type found at Lismullin made a compelling case for designating it as a National Monument.  The Director gave his assurance that the NMI would be of every assistance in affording the fullest advice and support in the necessary excavation programme of the henge.  I welcome the Director's offer of the full assistance of the National Museum.A recommendation from the Director that a special committee should be quickly installed in order to afford the National Monument at Lismullin the fullest and most detailed attention and a full excavation to the highest and most transparent standard has also been accepted.  That committee will meet for the first time this week.The Director also requested copies of various reports and that he be facilitated in any inspection of the archaeological works at Lismullin.  Copies of these reports will be supplied to him and the Director will be facilitated in inspecting the archaeological works.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	784	The administration of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme is delegated to local authorities within the framework laid down in statutory regulations; as far as is practicable, this is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility at local level.  In the light of substantially increased demand for grant assistance in recent years, the majority of local authorities have reviewed their schemes, in order to streamline their operation, and have introduced a variety of mechanisms to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need, including medical prioritisation, means testing and/or cost control.The issue of means testing was considered in the context of the review of the operation of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme, which was undertaken by my Department.  One of the primary aims of the review was to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need of such assistance.Details of the revised housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability were announced in February 2007 as part of the Government's new housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  A revised scheme to be known as the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability will assist in the provision/adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of people with a disability.  The revised scheme is designed to ensure that available funding is targeted at lower income households and those whose need is greatest.  Prioritisation of eligibility will be on the basis of medical and financial need with 95% of the approved cost of works available to those with annual household incomes of less than €30,000 tapering to 30% for those with annual incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.  The income bands for the purposes of means testing will be amended annually in line with the amount of wage inflation in the preceding year.  It is expected that the revised schemes will be implemented during 2007. Detailed administrative guidance for local authorities on the operation of the revised schemes will be issued in due course.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-06-27 00:00:00	Prelude	785	The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 provide that any person or body who makes a submission or observation to a planning authority regarding an application for permission must pay a fee of €20. The primary purpose of the fee is to contribute towards the costs of the service provided by planning authorities to persons who make submissions.The European Commission lodged an application with the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 17 May 2005 initiating proceedings against Ireland on the grounds that the charging of this fee was contrary to the public participation provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The ECJ heard the Commission's case on 24 April 2006, and on 9 November last dismissed the Commission's action.However, my Department is currently undertaking a study of the cost of the planning service with a view to reviewing the fees regulations in the context of improving service delivery. I believe that this study also provides a useful opportunity to review the fee for making submissions on planning applications.In relation to the public consultation period on a planning application, the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 provide that the period during which the public may make submissions on a planning application is 5 weeks from receipt of the application by the planning authority. Accordingly a planning authority may not make a decision on a planning application until the period for public consultation has expired.Previous regulations did not provide a finite period for the making of submissions. This had resulted in some uncertainty for third parties in terms both of the timing of making of submissions, and of the decision making process itself. The current provisions give greater clarity and ensure that planning authorities are given a sufficient period in which to consider all the relevant information, including submissions and observations from third parties on an application, before reaching a determination.

A reply to the Commission issued on 27 November, stating that the settlement strategy within Wicklow's County Development Plan was in line with the National Spatial Strategy, Regional Planning Guidelines and the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines.  It was pointed out that the county settlement strategy had a specific criterion which facilitates those who need to be located in a rural area for economic activity.My Department has received no further communication from the Commission on this matter.  It is, however, understood from recent media reports that the European Commission will be considering the matter at a meeting on 27 June.  If my Department receives any further correspondence from the Commission on this issue, it will be given due consideration.

The role of the Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities under the Regional Broadband Programme.Despite Government investment in broadband in the regions through the Regional Broadband Programme, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  The procurement process for the Government's new National Broadband Scheme (NBS) was launched on the 2 May 2007.  This scheme will provide broadband services to the areas of Ireland that are currently unserved and ensure that every reasonable request for broadband in these unserved areas is met.  The estimated timescale for the award of the NBS contract is December 2007, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter, subject to agreement with the chosen Service Provider.

The Bill will include provisions enabling EirGrid to own infrastructure and undertake any necessary borrowing.  The full extent and substance of the statutory provisions required will be teased out over the next number of months.  The legislation is also likely to include a range of amendments to the Electricity Supply Act 1927 and the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to fully reflect the new arrangement.In line with successive Partnership Agreements, there will be a full process of engagement with the Management and Unions of both ESB and EirGrid on implementation of this policy decision by the end 2008 deadline.  The process of discussion will also include the legitimate concerns of the ESOT.The transfer of the transmission assets will be undertaken in a manner that ensures the future positioning of both EirGrid and ESB as strong Semi-State companies, as well as reflecting the position of the State and the ESOT as shareholders.   I am confident that the ESB Group will remain a strong, commercially viable and integrated entity after completion of this process.  It is equally important that EirGrid, as the independent owner and operator of the national grid, is securely positioned in that strategic role so that it can fully contribute to developing effective competition in the electricity market, reducing energy costs and encouraging investment as well as ensuring security of supply.
