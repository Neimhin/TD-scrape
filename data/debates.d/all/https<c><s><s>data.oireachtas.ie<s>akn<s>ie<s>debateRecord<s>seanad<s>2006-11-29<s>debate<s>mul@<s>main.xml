          <p eId="para_13">That is interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">In a republic, the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary are two of the most important principles.  As a republican, I have always appreciated those principles in our institutions of State.  However, I refer to a worrying development concerning the Criminal Justice Act 1999, which introduced mandatory minimum sentencing for the possession or sale of drugs with a street value in excess of €13,000.  Evidence compiled by Deputy Costello demonstrates clearly that in 90% of cases before the courts last year involving drugs with a street value of more than €13,000, a mandatory minimum sentence was not applied.  This is a serious matter.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas determined that a mandatory sentence should be in place to deal with serious drug pushers and drug barons but the courts are refusing to impose the will of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">We have a responsibility to ask judges to explain in open court why they are deviating from the clear obligations set out in the 1999 legislation.  We may need to revisit the legislation because society needs to know that people who peddle large amounts of drugs will be tackled and prosecuted as set out in the 1999 legislation and that if they are found guilty before the courts, they will receive minimum mandatory sentences of ten years or as much as life imprisonment.  This important issue must be teased out and addressed and I raise it in such a fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">In recent weeks, Senator Bannon and others have raised an important matter relating to the conclusions of Mr. Justice Barr in the July report of the Barr tribunal, which was established in April 2002.  It has been five months since the report's publication, but the House, which established the tribunal, has not had an opportunity to debate its findings.  I appreciate that the Leader has done her best in trying to arrange a date for the debate, but it is not good enough that the House must go cap in hand to the Executive to decide when we can discuss an important report of a tribunal established by us.  That we cannot set the date dumbs down Parliament and brings no dignity to the House.  I suggest to the Leader that we set a date now.  If the Government attends to debate the matter, fine, but if not, we should proceed regardless.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_17">The point raised by Senator Brian Hayes on mandatory sentencing is important because it goes to the core of the separation of powers principle.  I voted for the legislation and two similar Bills when they were before the House, but each time I raised with the relevant Ministers whether mandatory sentences were unconstitutional owing to the separation of powers.  The Judiciary is supposed to act in judgment and we, as legislators, cannot determine mandatory sentences.  Otherwise, we would not need a court system to make judgments.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Nonetheless, Senator Brian Hayes has made a very important point and people elsewhere are making the same point.  There should be an understanding of why we find ourselves where we are.  Every time we pass mandatory sentencing legislation, we are telling the population that we are great in deciding on mandatory sentences and now it is over to the crowd in the courts.  However, the Oireachtas will be found wanting the day the constitutionality of a mandatory sentence is tested in the Supreme Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">The important issue of explanations raised by Senator Brian Hayes and which has been dealt with elsewhere recently should be examined to see whether it would be possible to have judges explain why certain sentences were given.  We will find that we have not got the other issue right.  Time will tell, but the matter needs airing, to be addressed and to be debated publicly.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">A number of times, we have debated the importance of town centres and how small shops are part of the community and provide services.  In the past two years, we have had many debates on the groceries order, which has come and gone.  Recently, I spoke to a person in the business of selling books, CDs and DVDs in a provincial town.  He told me that he had effectively been closed down as a book shop because whenever there is a decent book on the market, Tesco or Dunnes Stores — he mentioned them in particular — will sell it at below cost price.  When I met him again, he told me that the situation was worse this year and I asked him to give me an example.  He was selling the "The Best of U2" CD, which cost him as a retailer €16.33, including VAT, but the CD was on sale down the road in Tesco for €13.90.  Similarly, the "Pirates of the Caribbean" DVD is on sale in Tesco for €24.90, but it cost him €25.35.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I am in favour of competition and we are all in favour of people getting the best services, but we are putting many small businesses out of business.  We should examine the matter so that town centres can have life in them and people in urban areas and villages can get a service.  I would welcome a discussion with the appropriate Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">This morning, I heard a wonderful phrase, namely, the paralysis of handcuffed mediocrity.  I thought about the Government's inability to meet its commitment regarding buses in Dublin because of a disagreement in Government, the delay in sorting out the future of Dublin Airport because of a disagreement in Government, the fact that the Cork Airport debt situation has not been sorted out because of a disagreement in Government, the delay in developing broadband because of a disagreement about whether the State should be involved and the delays in expanding the rail service because of a disagreement.  The list of ideological differences or the differences between an ideology and no ideology, which has a bit of cop on about what is popular, is endless.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">It was a wonderful phrase to discover and I thank the Tánaiste for creating it.  He was trying to blame other people, but the best evidence of a paralysis of handcuffed mediocrity is the stasis in the Government concerning many fundamental issues.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_28">Yesterday, the European Parliament published a report on rendition to which the Government gave its usual response, which did not address the report.  No one on this side of the House or in the country alleged that there were prisoners in the CIA planes that landed here because there is no evidence to that effect.  We do not make allegations for which we have no evidence. The Government, however, continues to deny allegations that have not been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">We want to know why the Government tolerated empty but profoundly suspect planes refuelling at Shannon Airport?  In the eyes of Europe, we are tainted as being connected with the torture of people because we pretended that we did not know and said that we relied on the assurances of the US Government.  Let me explain about that Government.  It demanded and got access to our international banking transactions through SWIFT in Belgium without asking our permission or telling us in advance.  Our Government, which has ignored that illegal activity and has allowed it to continue, wants us to believe that it is sufficient to accept the Americans' statement that they never did anything wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">A country that used to boast about its vigorous and brave neutrality and in which people from all parts of the political spectrum stood up for decency and human rights and opposed torture is now tainted by the fact that we have participated <i>de facto</i> in an extraordinary conspiracy of torture and breaches of human rights by allowing planes that carried people to be tortured to be refuelled and, sometimes, cleaned on our territory.  The Government’s response has been to close its eyes.  I appeal for the establishment of an Oireachtas committee to investigate the truth of what happened at Shannon Airport.  It will not be allowed, but we will ask again and again to clear the country of involvement in a conspiracy to hurt, damage and, perhaps, kill.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I support Senator Brian Hayes on mandatory sentencing.  If what is happening is true — I am sure it is — then both Houses of the Oireachtas are wasting their time.  We are all aware that when Members of this and the other House question decisions taken by the Judiciary we are quickly reminded that it is none of their business.  It is clear from the cases referred to by Senator Brian Hayes that members of the Judiciary assume the legislation will not stand up if it goes before the Supreme Court.  It is a very worrying development and one with which every Member of this House should be concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the House.  A worrying situation is developing in respect of local newspapers.  Cartels are buying them up and I am reliably informed that there is now only one paper in Leinster which prints its own issue.  The word "monopoly" springs to mind, therefore, I call for an urgent debate to tease out the issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">In the past few years road safety has been foremost in all our minds and has been debated on numerous occasions in the House.  The responsibility for road safety falls in large part on the Garda Síochána.  One of today's newspapers reports a worrying statistic that 2,013 vehicles driven by gardaí have been involved in accidents in recent years, resulting in large compensation claims against the State.  There are very poor training facilities for Garda drivers in our depots and it falls to the discretion of the local superintendent to allow a garda to drive a Garda vehicle.  It is necessary for gardaí to drive vehicles but such a high incidence of accidents projects a very bad image of Garda drivers, who are responsible for safety and the maintenance of order on our roads.  Of the 2,013 accidents to which I referred four involved ministerial cars, so it is important this trend is rapidly reversed.  I call on the Leader to ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to immediately provide the resources and facilities for adequate driver training for gardaí.</p>

I have more than a passing interest in the music industry and hope the Leader responds to the Senator's point.  Something murky is happening in the undergrowth of the international music industry.  There is no doubt that the major outlet which Senator O'Toole named is attempting to wipe out small retailers across the country by targeting particular areas of the retail market such CDs, books and various other niche sectors which small, family-run businesses have operated in towns and villages across the country.  The company has moved into my own part of the country and can do so because of the power it has.  The big five international music record companies are complicit in this by the pricing mechanism they use, primarily arising from the fact that most people can now buy on-line at the prices to which Senator O'Toole referred.  This is a move by the music industry to protect its market but it does so at the expense of the small retailer.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I ask the Leader to pass on the good wishes of the Irish immigration lobby in the US to efforts being made to revive immigration reform law there.  Moves to do so, provided there is the time in the dying days of the 109th Congress, have been outlined by the judiciary chairman, Arlon Spector, a member of the Republican Party.  He is currently meeting with outgoing Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and the outgoing Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, to examine if they can move meaningful immigration reform before the end of the 109th Congress.  I hope the Leader will convey the strong encouragement of all sides in this House of his efforts to ensure it happens.</p>

Admittedly it was an American prisoner but it should not have happened and flatly contradicted everything Condoleezza Rice said.  Thank God for the former Leader of the Opposition in this House, Maurice Manning, chairman of the Human Rights Commission, who made it clear that there was a case to answer and that the Minister's attitude was unsatisfactory, with which I agree.

The Minister has told us time and again that it is intended to purchase credits and so forth but nothing is happening.  Ireland will be the laughing stock of Europe.  It is one of the countries named in an EU report on greenhouse gas emissions and our negligence in this area is highlighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">I support Senator Brian Hayes's call for a debate on the Barr report.  The report was published last July.  The tribunal heard from 169 witnesses and sat for 208 days.  We must learn from the mistakes of the Abbeylara shooting.  The delay in debating this report is having a devastating effect on the local community in County Longford.  It is important that an urgent debate is held on the matter.  Hardly a week passes without me calling for this debate.  This issue is disturbing for the Carthy family, the neighbourhood in Abbeylara and people generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">We show great disrespect for reports that are prepared at huge cost to the State.  It is important that we show respect for the people who contributed to and who compiled the Barr report.  Many of the issues raised in the report must be addressed to ensure that events such as occurred in Abbeylara never happen again.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">With regard to debating reports, on Committee Stage of the Prisons Bill yesterday we discussed establishing the Inspector of Prisons as a statutory position.  I expressed my disappointment to the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that we had been unable to debate the report of the Inspector of Prisons even though the Leader had asked several times for such a debate in the Seanad.  He said it was the business of both Houses what they did about debating reports and that if we debated all reports, there would be no time to do anything else.  I refrained from pointing out that the Dáil had been adjourned several times recently because there was no business to be debated.  There would have been plenty of time, therefore, to debate the report of the Inspector of Prisons in that House, if not here.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">We should take up the suggestion made by Senator Brian Hayes.  If a Minister is not available, we should simply debate these reports ourselves.  These are important reports.  I believe 98% of the reports we commission are never debated.  We seem to think we have done something when we commission them, but we must examine them.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">I support Senator Maurice Hayes's comments on mandatory sentencing for drugs offences.  When we originally debated this provision I expressed the view that it was ridiculous.  One issue was the price that should be calculated.  Would it be the wholesale price, retail price, the price north of the city or south of the city?  The bottom has fallen out of the drugs market.  Prices are down approximately 50% due to the over-supply of heroin.  Is the price calculation to be based on the price at the time the crime was committed or when the case comes before the courts?  What is to be done?  It was a ridiculous way of sentencing people because it would not necessarily affect the people who are profiting most.</p>

There were newspaper reports over the weekend about Deputy Mildred Fox.  Due to time constraints, she is unable to spend time at home with her three children.  This morning, there are four women and 26 men in this Chamber, a ratio which bears little relationship with the fact that half of the population is female.  Men and women think differently on issues, so we need to elect women in much greater numbers to the Seanad and the Dáil.  I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate on the ridiculous hours — sometimes until 11.00 p.m. — that the Dáil is required to sit.  It reminds me of a club in London for gentleman farmers.</p>

I also agree with Senators O'Toole and Maurice Hayes on the need for a debate on sentencing.  We would all agree that our Judiciary is wonderful for the most part and that judges consider individual cases on their merits and the evidence offered before the court but the reasons given by judges for the sentences they impose often go unreported.  A debate on sentencing would be useful.</p>

In the past few years, 400 post offices have been lost and the Garda stations in these places have long since been closed.  Senator Mooney referred to the sale of books and compact disks.  Predatory practices exist in that regard, so we should be watchful.  A debate on that issue would also be useful.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">Senator O'Toole raised the issue of small businesses.  This House may be crying crocodile tears in that regard because the horse has already bolted.  I was one of those retailers who bought compact discs for €17.99 and sold them for €19.99 until Tesco began to sell them for €14.99.  Similar challenges arise in every town and village in the country.  Small businesses are kept going because people earn less than the minimum wage for the hours they work and are digging into the money they made over the past 20 years.  This state of affairs cannot continue.  We are not doing enough in this House for small businesses in terms of giving them the economic incentives they need to thrive.  Unless we take action urgently, we will have ghost towns and villages.  Unfortunately, the problem is already upon us, so rather than cry crocodile tears, we should do our best to save small businesses.</p>

The fact that Garda cars are not subject to the national car test gives rise to dangers to gardaí and the public.  What are the intentions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with regard to subjecting Garda cars to the national car test?  They should be tested in the same manner as every other car on the road.  Several accidents have taken place as a result of the poor condition of Garda cars and the lack of training of their drivers.  The issue should be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">I support Senator Brian Hayes on the issue of mandatory sentences.  The Senator referred to the Criminal Justice Act 1999 but the provisions for mandatory sentences are even stronger in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which was fully supported in this House.  The sovereign wishes of the people are represented by the Houses of the Oireachtas, so if these Houses pass legislation on mandatory sentencing, our decisions should be respected by the Judiciary.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">Senator O'Toole said that when previous criminal justice Bills were being debated, he raised the danger that we were skating on thin ice with regard to minimum mandatory sentencing because such sentences could be open to constitutional challenge on the grounds that it is a judge's duty to pass sentence.

          <p eId="para_127">Senator Mooney wishes me to refute what Senator Ryan has said.  We must await the report before debating the matter fully in the House.

This is not hero worship but fact.  The Minister came with the Prisons Bill 2006 and spent all his time on it here, preferring not to run away and send someone in his stead.  On Committee Stage, he did the same.  Having listened to the debate on the amendments, I feel that he gives the best value that I have ever experienced.

I agree with Senator Henry's observation that we issue reports and then consider matters done and dusted, when they have not been considered properly.  We will endeavour to do that, since Senator Bannon has frequently sought a debate.  The Minister has attended this House much more often than any of his colleagues.  There are two Houses, and he must divide his time while also holding the position of Tánaiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Senator Leyden gave us a very vivid account of the past of Democratic Left, on which I shall not comment.  Senator Henry raised the report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, which we will also try to debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Senator White brought up the low level of female participation in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I listened to a Deputy speaking on Sunday radio and thought that she raised a very important issue.  I did not hear a single women's group talking about it, and it excited no further debate, although it should have done so.  The Deputy in question has three young children under the age of five.  She gets home on time to see them, so Dáil hours are not the problem.  It is more a matter of residents' meetings and other events to which we are bidden.  They start at 9 p.m. and go on until 12 a.m., and the Deputy never saw her children.  She raised an important issue about which she was very honest.  She had obviously given the matter a great deal of thought.  She said that members of her organisation were very upset and emotional about it.  They had supported her career for a long time, but she felt unable to do everything, and one cannot.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Smart women are beginning to realise that when they have young children, it is very difficult to do everything.  The same is true of men who take a full role in parenting and in the home.  It is very difficult, and we all know that public life is not all swanning around and entails a great deal of hard work.  The meetings that go on late at night were the difficulty that she pinpointed.  Senator White said that we should debate the fact that we are badly represented by women.  I know that she meant that numerically, but I reaffirm that they are fine representatives.  I did not want to let that go uncorrected.  There are not many women in this House, but those whom we have are doing well.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFahey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_142">I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to inform the Seanad of progress on this important and serious issue.  Domestic violence is too often a hidden crime in our society and we must never lose sight of the fact that it is a crime.  Society must treat it as such and must punish offenders most severely.  We must create a culture where every man, woman and child enjoys the right to live in peace and harmony in his or her home.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">The excellent report published by the National Crime Council last year showed that 15% of women, or some one in seven, and 6% of men, or approximately one in 16, have experienced severely abusive behaviour of a physical, sexual or emotional nature from a partner at some time in their lives.  The council noted that while the risk to women as victims is higher, domestic abuse also affects a significant number of men.  The survey suggests that in the region of 213,000 women and 88,000 men in Ireland were severely abused by a partner at some point in their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Accordingly, while the focus tends to be on violence against women, we also must ensure that supports are available to men who are victims.  We must create a culture where both male and female victims of violence can seek support and redress through the legal system and other support services without experiencing embarrassment and shame.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Much has been achieved since the 1997 Task Force Report on Violence against Women was published as a blueprint, recommending new structures and comprehensive services to bring perpetrators to justice and to support victims.  I chair the national steering committee on violence against women, which brings together all the Departments, State bodies and non-governmental organisations which work with victims of violence.  As a committee, we work proactively to implement the recommendations of the task force report.  I cannot go further without paying tribute to all those in both the voluntary and State sectors who continue to work selflessly with victims of domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The Government's key aims in regard to domestic violence are threefold.  Our objective is to bring perpetrators to justice; help victims, who are most frequently women, to come forward to seek help and redress, and to provide them with the support they and their families need; and stamp out this dreadful crime by creating awareness among people of all ages, and by changing the culture of anger and violence that can infiltrate intimate partner relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The Department of Health and Children, through the Health Service Executive, makes available some €12 million annually to support services and developments to help combat and respond to domestic violence and sexual assault.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government makes capital and current funding available to voluntary housing bodies and local authorities, respectively, for accommodation for homeless persons, which may include persons who are victims of domestic violence.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, together with the Garda and the Courts Service, play a major role in the responses to domestic violence of the civil and criminal justice systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">It is important that perpetrators of domestic violence are brought to justice.  It is a difficult crime to deal with, however, because there may be barriers of influence, authority, shame and even affection between the perpetrator and victim, which can militate against reporting and prosecution of the offence.  Tackling these barriers is crucial and the Garda Síochána is working to ensure that domestic violence is dealt with as a serious criminal matter.  A domestic violence and sexual assault unit was established as a national facility in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The Garda has a written policy on domestic violence intervention which is arrest oriented and recognises the vulnerable circumstances in which victims find themselves.  Any evidence of fear or harassment is brought to the attention of the court in the event of a bail application.  This domestic violence policy is an integral part of Garda training and is reinforced continuously.  All the feedback on its policy is positive.  Nonetheless, the Garda has undertaken a review of its policy with a view to modernising and honing its procedures further.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">A strong legal framework for tackling domestic violence is also essential.  Under the code of criminal law, there is a range of sanctions the courts can apply in situations involving violence against women.  Civil law also provides a range of orders to protect victims from abuse.  Contravention of an order under the Acts is an offence and subject to sanctions under the criminal law.  Under the Acts, the Garda has powers of arrest without warrant to deal with cases of domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Statistics from the Courts Service for 2005 show that 1,037 safety orders, 2,622 protection orders, 550 interim barring orders and 1,265 barring orders were granted last year.  The statistics also show that 115 safety orders, 71 protection orders, 34 interim barring orders and 100 barring orders were refused in that year.  In addition, 1,714 safety orders, 157 protection orders, 38 interim barring orders and 1,818 barring orders were withdrawn or struck out in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Although there has been progress, the level of reporting of incidents of domestic violence remains low.  The National Crime Council report found that a little less than one quarter of all people surveyed who had experienced severe domestic abuse reported that abuse to the Garda.  The reasons for non-reporting are complex, including a belief that the abuse was not serious enough, that it was the victim's fault in some way or that to report it could end the relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">This highlights the complexity of the issue and the need to build up the confidence of victims and their awareness of the supports open to them.  This is being done in several ways, including the provision of support to victims as they proceed through the legal channels and working with the perpetrators of violence to make them understand the gravity of their violent crimes and to enable them to change their behaviour towards the partner.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The Commission for Support of Victims of Crime within my Department provides funding to Women's Aid and to the rape crisis centres to assist with running court accompaniment services which assist the victims.  My Department also funds several perpetrator programmes which are designed to promote changes in personal behaviour and to prevent future abuse.  This type of work both here and internationally is relatively new and is far from straightforward.  In some instances, however, and with the right safeguards, it has a role to play in tackling domestic violence.  We have undertaken a review of the existing programmes, and recommendations are being considered that will guide our policy decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">We also funded a pilot domestic violence intervention exercise in the Dún Laoghaire and Bray areas which aimed to work with all the agencies in the locality, including the Garda, Courts Service, and the probation and welfare service to make the criminal justice and other response systems work together better.  This project was the subject of an external independent evaluation, and some outstanding tasks are being completed prior to a full consideration of its efficacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The 1997 task force also recommended awareness raising programmes to make victims aware of the services that are open to them and to encourage them to take the difficult step of seeking help in dealing with their violent partner.  As I mentioned last week in regard to the launch of the latest awareness raising campaign, it is time for everyone to acknowledge that domestic violence is often a hidden crime whose victims may feel ashamed and embarrassed despite their innocence.  These victims need the support of friends and family as they address their difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">We must raise awareness of the need to change our culture, in which violence is all too often seen as the choice method of addressing a problem.  This requires us to start awareness raising with our youngest children and to inculcate the respect of human rights as a primary goal of our culture.  The current national media campaign ties in with the UN's 16 Days campaign and has the key message "Domestic Violence — End the Silence", stressing that free and confidential help and support are just a telephone call away.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">This debate is timely.  Last year the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform commissioned a study to review the work of the national steering committee on violence against women and the implementation of the 1997 task force report.  It was also to develop a new strategic action plan for the committee.  The final report from the consultants was recently received in the Department and is under consideration prior to its submission to the national steering committee. Today's debate will further inform our thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The issue of the difficulties faced by various sexual assault treatment units has been raised.  Action is being taken following the review commissioned last year.  Two new sexual assault treatment units will be established in Galway and the midlands.  I have asked the Department of Health and Children to re-examine funding for the Kerry unit which closed down.  I have been assured by the HSE that the recent issues in the Rotunda Hospital are not a matter of finance but of a small cohort of doctors trying to cover an out-of-hours rota.  The recent delays in sexual assault treatment in the Rotunda, which are unacceptable, have been caused by a shortage of doctors during out-of-hours and weekends.  Every effort is being made by the HSE to address this and to ensure adequate staff are in place to provide a service on a 24-hour, seven-day a week basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The main problem identified by the review was the shortage of trained staff for this vitally important service to victims of sexual assault.  Consequently, more forensic nurses will be trained and will be attached to acute hospitals.  This will provide a much better staffing set-up.  Extra resources are required and have been provided in the Estimates.  The HSE will roll out extra services in the next month.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">I accept that in the past several years the amount of money provided to voluntary organisations, such as the Rape Crisis Centre and Women's Aid, by the Department of Health and Children was inadequate.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is most anxious to address this issue.  She has assured me, and the various organisations, that adequate funding is provided in the Estimates for the various organisations to ensure they can continue their work effectively.</p>

        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_162">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this important issue.  Many Members call for debates on domestic violence to highlight the ongoing difficulties that many people face.  It is a problem that is not going away, unfortunately, but continues to grow.  We have not been able to arrest this growth.  While the Minister of State outlined the difficulties in dealing with the problem, I am concerned it is out of hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">I am referring to domestic violence in an inclusive context and am not discriminating against men.  It can affect anyone.  A man, a woman or a child can be a victim of domestic violence.  While I am not speaking solely about women and domestic violence, I must point out that women tend to suffer more in domestic violence.  Recently, the House debated the concerning rise in the number of murders of women in the State.  In the past ten years, 125 women have been murdered, some 50% in their own homes by a partner or former partner.  We do not see the same level of murder — thankfully — of men at the hands of women.  Murder is the extreme end of the domestic violence spectrum.  If we do not tackle the issue, several years from now that number will have grown.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">What is the cause of the increase in domestic violence incidents?  Is it problems with society?  Are people under greater stress, either from the work-life balance or financial pressures?  Why are many more relationships becoming more violent?  More money needs to be spent on education and awareness campaigns.  While I welcome the current awareness campaign, it needs to be the fore.  It should be part of a school programme.  While children need to be made aware that violence of any type is unacceptable, they must be taught that violence between family members is a particularly serious crime.  Children need to be taught how to resolve crises when they occur in families.  Many do not have the skills to solve problems when they arise which then develop into violent situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">The National Crime Council recently published figures on the extent and impact of domestic abuse against women and men in intimate partner relationships.  Up to 15% of women and 6% of men suffer severe domestic abuse; 29% of women and 26% of men suffer domestic abuse when severe and minor abuse are combined; 13% of women and 13% of men suffer physical abuse.  The report also shows that 29% of women, one in three, and only 5% of men, one in 20, report to the Garda.  The figures are startling, particularly those for reporting to the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The Minister of State outlined why many people are afraid to report the abuse but they must be encouraged to do so.  Where abuse goes unreported it may continue and get worse.  People must be informed as to how best to deal with the problem, by reporting to the Garda and going to the organisations which will attempt to help them if they receive adequate funding.  I welcome the promised increase which hopefully will come to the organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">People need support and further support is necessary when they go to court.  Studies show that people must wait for unacceptable periods before their cases are heard, be it to get a barring order or whatever.  The delays are unacceptable because these are vulnerable people.  I urge the Minister of State to do anything he can to ensure that resources are provided to enable the courts to respond quickly to those who need help.  The Minister of State mentioned the number of cases that went to court.  That costs time and money.  It would be better to give people the skills and the education to resolve their problems without having to go to court, and to continue to live together and keep the family unit together.  That requires resources for the organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Domestic violence has a serious impact on children who witness it.  They may become withdrawn and depressed and will not perform well in school.  The experience stays with them into their adult life and research has shown that children who have experienced or witnessed abuse may well become abusers.  They are incomplete and damaged people.  It is a serious problem and much more could be done at an early stage to intervene and give people the skills to work out their differences.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">While legislation and policies have focused on violence against women, which is a significant issue, the Department of Health and Children should conduct a study on the impact of domestic violence on men to create a more equal approach.  When we discuss domestic violence we should not confine it to women but should regard it as all-inclusive.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on that point.  I do not want anybody to suggest that I am trying to devalue work on violence against women because I am calling for more work and funding in that area, but I want to see more recognition of the fact that domestic violence affects men, women and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">I welcome what the Minister of State said about the sexual assault treatment units but we need more centres around the country, even when the two or three new ones come on stream.  Women should not have to travel a great distance if they have been raped.  Obstacles such as distance or waiting overnight or longer for a doctor's examination inhibit people from reporting the crime.  We need to examine this problem and see what can be done to ensure that the services are in place.  It is totally unacceptable, for example, that the people with the necessary medical and forensic skills were not available recently in the Rotunda Hospital.  I hope that sufficient numbers of these people will be trained to provide this service around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">I welcome the fact that we have had the opportunity to debate this issue on which much more could be said.  I also welcome the Minister of State's commitment to increase funding to organisations such as Women's Aid.  I hope he will also recognise organisations that help men in this difficult situation when allocating funding this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_172">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I thank Senator O'Rourke, who has kindly given us time on several occasions — this may be the second or third — to speak on this issue about which she and we care deeply.  It is a burning issue that neither receives enough attention nor is sufficiently addressed.  It is important each time we debate the issue to look back on the previous debate and ask ourselves whether we have made any progress.  If we have it has been extremely slow and we need to deal with that.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State make that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">We should pay tribute to all the fine non-governmental, voluntary agencies that work at the coalface of this issue.  It is most unfortunate for a family or individual to experience domestic violence.  These organisations give people in this situation unquantifiable strength.  Many of the agencies have been particularly associated with the protection of women but we now know that it is a problem for men too, and that agencies such as Amen and Men Overcoming Violence, MOVE, do great work for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Most of these organisations work in a vacuum because there are no resources for them to put in place proper structures about which people know and with which they can work.  They respond to basic needs, in a fire brigade action.  An organisation cannot be structured if it does not know from where its next few euro are coming.  That is something with which we must deal.  In examining some of the statistics we received, I discovered one agency revealed it was able to answer only 60% of calls made to it.  It is unable to answer two calls in five.  I welcome the media campaign to which the Minister referred.  It is an excellent idea.  As he stated, the reporting of incidents of domestic violence is low.  In part, this may be due to frustration.  Apart from the people who do not report this crime for one reason or another, others may get tired of trying to get through to a helpline and eventually give up.  Part of the problem is that people suffer in silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Those of us who have never experienced domestic violence cannot imagine how horrible and lonely it must be for people who are suffering.  Despite all the pain and anguish they endure, people still find it extremely difficult to leave a violent relationship.  It is difficult to understand this type of situation.  Research tells us people are often in as much, if not more, danger when they leave a violent relationship.  It is imperative that when a person makes the heart-wrenching decision to leave a violent relationship, that he or she would do so in the knowledge that the State can look after people in such circumstances.  That is not the case at present and this may be one reason for the low rate of reporting domestic violence.  We must ensure the necessary resources are in place to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">I can only imagine what it must be like for a woman, for example, to leave her home with her children with only the clothes on her back.  It must be the most soul-destroying emotional and physical process a person could ever go through.  In addition, such a person has to give up his or her home and all the dreams he or she had when starting out in the relationship.  People in these circumstances are worried about their future and that of their children.  Such people may be coping alone for at least some of that time.  In some cases there is no wider family circle to provide support.  In addition, there is always the fear of reprisal from the spouse who has been exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Refuge centres play a big part in dealing with this issue.  More than 20% of homeless households cite domestic violence as the reason for their need to be housed.  Of those, we are told 90% of households seeking assistance are headed by a woman.  These unfortunate facts demand attention.  In spite of the excellent care and respite offered by refuge centres, for the sake of all concerned, they can be only a short-term solution.  We hear people are being turned away from refuge centres in many parts of the country due to a lack of space.  That may not be the case in Dublin but places there are not of much benefit to a person in need in the west or any other part of the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">It is important that alternative accommodation is provided as soon as possible because it is impossible to order one's life from a refuge centre.  No child wants to go to school from a refuge centre.  By their nature, children can be unintentionally cruel and the playground can be a difficult place for children coming from a refuge centre.  This kind of stigmatisation can have a deep and lasting effect.  Children in such circumstances need counselling to help them address the difficulties they have encountered which can be damaging to their self esteem.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I recall trying to deal with the provision of housing for victims of domestic violence when I was a member of Dublin City Council.  Overall, we did a poor job.  We probably accommodated only one third of the requests we received.  At the time 80% of the women who were interviewed gave the lack of alternative housing as a reason for remaining in a bad relationship.  They were not confident that if they left their violent spouses they would find alternative accommodation.  From my experience at the time in Dublin City Council their position was valid in that we were unable to provide those people with alternative accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">It is difficult to understand why this horrible crime gets such poor media coverage.  In contrast, incidents of sexual assault and rape are frequently splashed across newspapers.  Unfortunately, domestic violence is a crime that occurs behind closed doors.  In some cases these crimes do not come to attention while in others they are not reported.  Where it is known, it is important that such crimes are reported.  Domestic violence should be seen for the cowardly act it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">As children, we all felt our homes were places of security and love.  That dream is smashed when a child witnesses his or her parents arguing and fighting and the impact of that must be extremely distressing.  In 80% of cases it is believed children either witness domestic violence or are in an adjacent room and hear what is going on.  We cannot comprehend what impact that has on children.  People working at the coalface of this problem are no doubt aware of the effect it has on children.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I read a publication called, Making an Impact, which discussed the impact of domestic violence on children.  Senator Terry alluded to this issue.  Children become withdrawn, secretive, silent and bitter.  In many instances, they blame themselves for the difficulties.  They face difficulties in school and have emotional problems.  They are confused about what they witnessed taking place between their parents.  They suffer sleep disturbance and have trouble eating.  They inflict self-harm and are affected by sickness and depression.  That is a dreadful legacy for a child to contend with when starting out in life.  Most of us who grew up in happy homes found it difficult to get where we are without having to contend with such problems.  We must ensure educational awareness programmes highlight the forms this horrible crime can take.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">In the main, discussion of domestic violence is confined to the suffering of women but other speakers have stated this is no longer the case.  Men also suffer domestic violence and this is now recognised.  In acknowledging that, we must take into account the plight of both men and women in dealing with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Senator Terry stated that 125 women had been murdered in the past ten years.  Eighty of these were murdered in their homes.  One would like to think they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, but if being in one's home means being in the wrong place at the wrong time, it is a sad reflection on our society.  I am aware the organisations have made budgetary submissions to the Minister for 2006-07.  I hope that we on the Government side take on board the necessary requirements to get us to the point where women, men and children can look to us as a nation for some help and assistance when they find themselves in this type of difficulty.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">I welcome what Senator Kett has just said.  It is important that the Government listens to the budgetary requirements of groups such as Women's Aid in particular.  It is clear that a comparatively small amount of money would make an enormous difference.  It is good that this comes from the Government side.  This House is united in asking the Government to do this.  I welcome that the Minister of State has shown a sensitivity towards the fact that there is also violence against men, some of which is quite serious.  Senator Kett said 19 people were murdered.  I would be surprised if any of them were men, I think they were all women, so that violence is extreme.  It would be a great pity if we got into a competition of victimhood——</p>

          <p eId="para_189">——between various organisations.  If anybody is battered, then it is a reproach to us all and we must all address it, while accepting that the preponderance of violence perpetrated by men, most of whom are intimately connected, is against women.  That said, I very much welcome the commitment of the Minister of State to ensure the needs of men are facilitated.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">I refer to the report conducted, I am glad to say, by an academic in my university, Trinity College.  The Minister of State described the report as excellent and it indicated that it was inappropriate to address the issue exclusively as one of violence against women.  An aspect of the report I found quite astonishing and which must be examined is that 49% of admissions to women's refuges were from the Traveller community which represents 0.6% of the entire population.  That is an extraordinary disproportion.  We need to find out the how, why, where and when, and what can we do.  It is a gross distortion that 49% of admissions were from the Traveller community which represents 0.6% of the population.  There is something seriously wrong in the Traveller culture that needs to be studied.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Women's Aid is a marvellous organisation and we are greatly in its debt.  The report is of great concern.  For example, there is a huge increase in calls, up 30% in 2005 from 19,000 to 25,000.  Of greater concern than anything else is that 10,504 were missed calls, a matter to which the Minister of State should pay attention and which he should address urgently.   The number of missed calls has increased in the past year from 26% to 40%.  A woman or man has to get the courage to make that report and then they are blocked, do not get a reply and the call is missed for one reason only — a lack of adequate resourcing.  Let us reflect on that — 10,000 people in distress whose calls are not listened to for this reason.  Both the calls and the applications for refuge are increasing rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The report has an interesting chart showing the types and incidence of abuse involved.  Some 57% were emotional abuse, 28% physical abuse and 6% sexual abuse.  When one looks at it, emotional abuse sounds vague but it is a way of controlling people.  The report states that the tactics of abuse used by perpetrators are deliberate, controlling and unrelenting.  The repetitive nature of the abuse has the effect of wearing a woman down gradually, making her doubt herself, putting her in fear and isolating her from supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The report moves on to the physical abuse and points out the catalogue of things that are done: struck with golf clubs, thrown against the wall, hit with a hammer, burnt with an iron and shot at.  This is astonishing and so much of this takes place within intimate relationships that must have started on a reasonably positive note.  Emotional abuse includes being stalked and watched constantly, denied food — this is medieval — and having to ask permission to turn on lights.  The mental cruelty involved in this controlling is all a question of power.  Sexual abuse includes being forced into prostitution by somebody they had loved, married and lived with, and coerced into re-enacting pornography and rape.  This is so degrading.  It a question of control and power.  The impact of the physical abuse includes foetal abnormality, which means it is passed on to another generation, miscarriage, and serious physical injuries which sometimes lead to attempted suicide.  It is not surprising that when broken down, the preponderance of requests concern legal advice from solicitors, court accompaniment, refuge and housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Some 67.5%, almost 70%, of attacks are committed by male intimates, 30% by male family, and 8.5% by male other.  There is no doubt there is a gender element.  There is also abuse of children which follows a similar pattern.  Children are even more vulnerable, yet they are beaten with weapons and are the victims of violent physical assault, attempted murder, being thrown across rooms and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Women's Aid sent Members some briefing material which is interesting.  It indicates that it has some concern about the shift that appears to be taking place towards including men.  What it says needs to be listened to.  Of great concern to Women's Aid is the way in which these contentions have been used to attack organisations working to end violence against women and to undermine the valuable work of refuges and frontline services.  This must not be done.  I did say there should not be a competition of victimhood but neither should reports be used to undermine the very valuable work of groups such as Women's Aid.  It has certainly traditionally been regarded as an area that is heavily gender centred.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The recommendations made are practical and, perhaps, the Minister would look at and address them.  Parents of the child in common but not residing together should be eligible for protection under the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  Often the couples may not live together on a permanent basis.  They have, however, a child in common and have access rights and so on.  These people are entitled to be protected.  It is not just a question of barring orders; it is a question of protecting the physical and emotional well-being of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">On a related issue there is the residence requirement for cohabitees applying for a safety order.  This should be removed.  It is a ridiculous qualification that they have got to be residing together.  It is a question of protecting people from physical danger.  A property qualification is appropriate for something to do with rates, it is not proper for something to do with physical violence.  The residence requirement for cohabitees who have an equal or greater interest in the property should be removed from barring order applications.  In the case at present of unmarried couples living together, a barring order may only be sought if the applicant has lived with the respondent for six of the previous nine months and has an equal or greater ownership right to the family home.  This is all about property.  This is nonsense.  We examine the rights of individual human beings rather than this legalistic property requirement.  Guidelines should be developed for the criteria for granting orders under the Domestic Violence Act 1996 because it fails to set out any of these criteria.  We need to speed up the court process in situations of gross domestic violence in some cases leading to murder.  Delay is not just justice denied, it is possibly lethal for the person who has applied.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_198">I thank Senator Norris for sharing time with me.  I was astonished to note the recent lack of understanding of domestic violence by a District Court judge.  On a Wednesday he told a woman, who withdrew her case for assault within the home, that he had come across a similar case on the Monday, that he was fed up of women crying wolf and that he was going to take action against them in the future.  It shows such a lack of understanding of domestic violence.  As other speakers have said, those women may have been terrified of what might happen to their children.  Some further education is needed in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Senator Norris referred to the over-representation of Traveller women among those who seek help in the refuges.  I do not have figures for migrant women who seek help.  This is a group that needs to be considered.  I am delighted the Leader is in the House because I heard her nephew, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, speak at the Irish association.  He said he wished people would talk about a multiethnic society rather than a multicultural society.  This point is important because some of our immigrants have different cultures.  However bad our culture is, we must recognise that domestic violence is worse in some other cultures.  The domestic violence Bill was introduced in India only in recent days after 30 years lobbying for its introduction.  Changes have been made in Pakistan in the recent past as they have in eastern Europe, from which we have many migrants.  There is more violence in some of those communities than we might be prepared to admit.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Women who come here are frequently isolated by their inability to speak English, by lack of money and by being controlled by the threat that they will be deported from the country if they go to the police.  If Women's Aid or any other organisation needs interpreter services, they should be supplied.  The courts and accident and emergency units should also have such services.  The late Dr. Fiona Bradley carried out a survey some years ago in the casualty department at St. James's Hospital.  If a woman presented, whom staff believed might have been beaten up, they ensured she was interviewed separately by a female nurse or female doctor.  In approximately one third of cases they found domestic violence had been the cause of the injury.  There was often a long delay of up to a week in reporting fractures.  If help with interpreting is needed in those cases, it is most important.  From patients coming to me for elective procedures, I have frequently met patients who did not speak English and were accompanied by a man claiming to be the husband.  Men are more likely to be working in the community and get a better command of English faster than their partners.  Health care professionals are at a terrible disadvantage when asking questions through someone else whom they might suspect as being involved in the injuries the woman sustained.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Owing to the issue of isolation, we are not discovering the problems that some women are experiencing.  As we know too well, some of these women get diverted into the sex trade.  The murder two years ago of a woman involved in the sex trade remains unexplained with no apparent lead.  We need to address the isolation of such people, as it is even more difficult for them than it is for Irish people.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_202">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who has been very consistent with his attention and diligence to this aspect of his brief.  We received very good documentation from Women's Aid and Amen.  I am disappointed a spirit of hostility is apparent in some of the documentation we received from Amen regarding supports and help for Women's Aid.  That is not the way it should be.  If violence takes place — as happens — perpetrated against both sexes, both should work together.  I do not fault Women's Aid in this regard as it has always put across its point of view clearly.  I did not like the particular point made by Amen which stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_203">There are many obvious reasons why men do not report, including the lack of support services for men.  This is a consequence of Government policy.  In excess of €15 million per annum is provided by Government for services for female victims, but less than 1% of this amount is provided for male victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">As a woman, I would not be in a position to discuss violence against either men or women from personal experience.  However, I have personal experience of people who have come to me in that regard, and they were always women.  I never received an approach from a man upon whom domestic violence had been perpetrated.  However, the 2003 National Crime Council survey found that men were the victims of domestic violence and therefore we must accept it.  However, I do not like the apparent spirit of rivalry.  It is an awful topic and should not be viewed in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">We had a similar debate last year and we have made a feature of it.  I thank those who commented on that point.  Senators Kett and Terry along with others referred to the difficulty of not being able to answer the telephone.  A telephone is a wonderful weapon for people who have been victims of domestic violence.  It is relatively anonymous and easy to lift the telephone and tell one's tale.  It is very serious that 40% of calls cannot be answered owing to lack of funding.  I spoke to the Minister of State after last year's debate and I know he tried to get additional funding for this sector, but it did not materialise.  While he was able to provide for other matters, this additional money is desperately needed.  People working in the voluntary sector are greatly fuelled by idealism and by a wish to do the right thing and help.  However, if that is thwarted by a lack of money, they feel a strong sense of upset and frustration.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The Minister of State also spoke about the need for two more centres, one in Galway — obviously he will look after Galway all right — and one for the midlands.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">It pinpointed Galway and the midlands.  The midlands is a vast area and I suggest Athlone should be chosen.  I ask the Minister of State to revert to me on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Senator Norris spoke about physical abuse involving being struck by golf clubs, which indicates a particular social stratum in society, thrown against a wall, being hit by a hammer, burnt with an iron — perhaps that was against a man — and shot at. Such events are occurring in homes which were set up as havens against the world by people who were, I presume, together and in love but which have since become places of violence.  It is sad and awful that this has been the outcome of a course on which people set out with high hopes.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">There is an issue of power at stake here, namely, the power men wish to have over women or, in some instances, that which women want to have over men.  I have a difficulty in dealing with the AMEN submission.  I believe what is contained in the survey carried out by the National Crime Council.  When, however, one considers matters, men are usually bigger, stronger and better able to defend themselves than women.  I cannot equate this with people with whom I am familiar who are in situations of this nature and who are finding it difficult to cope.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I suggest that much greater effort be invested in finding and assisting men who are being abused by women.  Perhaps men do not report violence against them by women because they feel people would not believe them.  Certain men may be of the opinion that their macho image would be demeaned and destroyed if it emerged that they were the subject of violence perpetrated by a member of what they consider to be the lesser sex.  I do not know if this is the case, but certainly particular men do not report such violence whereas women do report it.  In my view, women who report violence against them are great.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I return to what I said earlier about excellent telephone answering service that is available.  Those who offer this service are seeking additional money to fund it.  This service offers a blanket of comfort to callers and makes them believe that they can remain anonymous while reporting violence against them until matters are referred to the Garda or other agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I have not yet referred to children.  When children witness violence in their homes, they will, when they grow up, perpetuate matters by harbouring feelings of wanting to inflict hurt or visit abuse of one kind or another on their partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I welcome this debate and I hope that concerns in respect of this matter will be reflected in an enhanced budget allocation.  I also hope that further work will be carried out on the issue of violence against men.  I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House and I look forward to seeing what emerges in the budget.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_107">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_216">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and I thank the Leader for arranging to debate this important matter today in advance of the budget.  I also thank Senator Terry who raised this issue on the Order of Business on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">It is good that we are being given the opportunity to discuss domestic violence.  Last week, the Minister for Finance came before the House to discuss the Book of Estimates.  One of the issues I raised, to which the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, did not reply at the end of the debate, was the paltry increase in funding for those organisations that deal with people who are victims of domestic abuse.  I echo the comments of Senators on all sides of the House who referred to the lack of funding with which these organisations must cope.  The latter is a real problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I also wish to echo the sentiments expressed by previous speakers to the effect that domestic violence, contrary to the myth that has developed, is not an issue which affects only women, it is also affecting a growing number of men.  I support calls that the organisations which deal with the male victims of domestic violence should receive commensurate funding from the Departments concerned with the area of such violence.  The budget is one week away and the Minister will have some leeway in the interim to make changes in specific areas.  I am sure most members would support me in suggesting that the Minister should use that leeway to ensure that funding to the organisations to which I refer will be dramatically increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">A 2% increase for the area of women's aid was announced in the Book of Estimates.  In real terms, this will be a decrease because inflation is moving at a rate much higher than 2%.  By the end of the year, it will be much more significant than 2%.  I urge the Minister of State to communicate to the Minister for Finance that we are seeking significantly more than the 2% increase announced in the Book of Estimates.  We are also seeking that those organisations which deal with male victims of domestic violence should become eligible for State subvention.  At present, approximately 99% of the money raised by the organisations that support male victims is gathered through voluntary efforts and fund-raising.  This situation should be rectified.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Previous speakers referred to statistics relating to levels of domestic violence.  Many of them highlighted the National Crime Council's report from last year, which contained many startling figures.  For example, 29% of women and 26% of men stated in response to the survey that they were the victims of domestic abuse.  Those two figures are much higher than most people would have anticipated and the fact that there is such a small difference between them indicates that much more domestic violence is perpetrated against men than people previously believed.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">I wish to echo the opinions expressed by a number of Senators with regard to the figures in the National Crime Council report relating to Traveller women.  I refer here to the fact that it is stated that 49% of the total number of cases of domestic violence against females relate to Traveller women.  That figure is hugely disproportionate, particularly when one considers the size of the Traveller community in the context of the overall population.  There is a need to educate the Traveller community to the effect that this type of constant abuse cannot be permitted or accepted.  The Minister for Finance, when announcing the budget next week, could also provide funding and resources in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I agree with Senators who welcomed the recent media campaign.  Any such campaigns which highlight domestic abuse are welcome.  My only reservation in respect of the current campaign is that it reinforces the stereotypical image that domestic violence is perpetrated by abusive husbands.  The most recent statistics indicate that situations of domestic violence are often not caused by abusive husbands and that female partners can often be quite abusive.  In future media campaigns, perhaps the Government will try to ensure that people are presented with a more balanced picture.  The use of children in the advertisements relating to the current campaign, particularly in the context of the time of year, is an extremely effective tool.  As already stated, any media campaign in respect of this issue must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Previous speakers referred to the fact that 125 women were murdered in the past ten years and that 80 of them were killed in their homes.  That is a startling statistic. Of this number, 47% were murdered by their partner or former partner.  That highlights the gravity of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Carlow Women's Aid and a number of other Women's Aid organisations have organised meetings and rallies.  A march will be held next Monday in Carlow town to highlight the number of women murdered in their homes over the past ten years.  I am familiar with the services provided by Amber, the women's refuge in Kilkenny.  I echo the Leader's comment that many of the refuges are not funded sufficiently, as a result of which their telephone lines are not manned 24 hours a day.  Quite often, calls made to such shelters are not dealt with by somebody at the time they are made, and that is a major problem which can only be addressed through a significant increase in the resources at the disposal of refuges and other organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The budget will be announced next week.  The Minister of State should convey the concerns of the House to the Minister of Finance and ask for significant increases in funding for victims of domestic abuse in the budget.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryMWhite" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_226">I thank the Leader for putting this serious issue on the schedule as part of the Women's Aid campaign and as the budget approaches.  I also thank the Minister of State for sticking with the issue, which we debated last year but, as he said, nothing much has happened.  We are all commenting on the awfulness of the suffering of men and women who are physically abused.  In addition, children suffer as a result of domestic violence but we do not hear much about that.  Following my contribution to last year's debate, I received an e-mail from schoolchildren who were doing a project on domestic violence and they wanted to highlight the effect of domestic abuse on children.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I refer to Traveller women, two of whom are good friends of mine.  They live in poverty and they have a tortuous, unbelievable and cruel existence as they rear large families.  They live in the most primitive conditions which we, as members of the settled community, could not even contemplate.  I will not reiterate the statistics outlined earlier because action is needed.  The Minister of State is optimistic funding will be increased.  However, this issue is related to the human rights of victims of domestic violence, including children and Traveller women.  As Senator O'Rourke stated, it is unforgivable that insufficient funding is available in the richest country in Europe to staff a helpline for victims of domestic abuse.  We should not debate the issue again if the Government does not get it right in the budget because it will only be a waste of time.  The Minister of State takes this issue seriously and he looks after the Traveller community in his constituency.  However, he must put his foot down with the Minister for Health and Children to secure funding for organisations working in this area.  There is sufficient money in the pot to address this human rights issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_228">The debate has been organised as part of an international campaign on violence against women.  This is a worldwide problem and it is symptomatic of the inequality experienced by women in many societies where, at its most extreme, female genital mutilation is very much part and parcel of being a woman.  It is important that we do what we can to address the inequality experienced by women throughout the world and to support initiatives to prevent violence against women.  I support the statement by Mary Robinson recently and I acknowledge the issue of violence against men, which was raised by previous speakers.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I received a number of briefing documents from various groups, including Women's Aid, about violence against women and it is a serious problem because of the damage that can be done.  Women can be more vulnerable for many reasons, especially those related to equality issues such as access to employment and the ability to become financially independent, so they cannot escape the violence and they are physically weaker.  Women are in more danger as a result of domestic violence but it must be acknowledged that men also experience such violence.  While it is not a new phenomenon, it has always been hidden.  Amen Ireland forwarded a document which outlined that men who experience domestic violence have difficulty securing help.  More needs to be done to provide structures and supports for them so that they will not be afraid to come forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">When there are two sides on an issue, the answer is often somewhere in the middle. If one says domestic violence is experienced by men, one is considered by interest groups to be weakening the case of people who work to deal with domestic violence against women and <i> vice versa</i>.  However, that is not the case and the various interest groups have much more common ground than they realise, which they must acknowledge.  As a society, we are fighting against violence against either gender and perhaps different initiatives need to be taken to support both genders when they experience violence.  Our objective is to prevent all forms of domestic violence and to provide necessary supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">If I raise the issue of domestic violence against men with women's groups, their members react defensively and <i>vice versa</i>.  Often, there is a misunderstanding in that if one discusses women’s rights, it does not mean that one is not acknowledging that men are also discriminated against in society.  In terms of how the argument is pitched, we must move beyond this defensiveness and realise that the issues, which are not mutually exclusive, must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">It is important that members of either gender who experience domestic violence feel free to come forward and get support.  Just as women's groups would argue that one should always ensure that women feel free to get help and talk about their situations, one should ensure that men feel safe in coming forward and stating whether they are victims of domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">It is important that we provide the necessary funding for groups working with people who experience domestic violence.  Women's Aid has provided thousands of examples of situations in which it was unable to answer telephone calls from people seeking help.  The group raised the issue of people seeking refuge because there should be enough refuges available in different parts of the country.  Local supports for victims of domestic violence are vital and people should be able to go to places in their communities if they need advice and so on concerning domestic violence or other matters.  As some people in rural communities are isolated and have many children, support agencies should be able to visit their homes and provide the necessary support.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">The Women's Aid document refers to the need for more housing options.  There is a general problem relating to social housing and housing options for people.  Women's Aid makes the point that the single greatest reason people do not leave situations of domestic violence is because they have nowhere to go.  In a survey of homeless people, it was found that a high percentage of women were homeless because they had experienced domestic violence.  Due to the broader issue of providing more social, affordable or transitional housing or places of refuge, many people cannot escape the situations in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">A number of recommendations have been made.  Multiannual funding for groups that work with people experiencing domestic violence is needed.  It is an issue that goes across the board because non-profit organisations, which must apply for funding from year to year, never know where they stand or what level of service they will be able to provide.  In a paper supplied to me, it was pointed out that security in finance via multiannual funding is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The Minister of State may comment on the recommendation concerning the need to amend the Domestic Violence Act so that people experiencing domestic violence at the hands of ex-partners who are not living with them can avail of the Act's provisions.  Other recommendations have been made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">For a short time while I was a solicitor, I worked in family law and I have a fair amount of experience with the system.  It should be reformed.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">The Australian example should be examined.  It has overhauled its system to remove as many family law cases from the courts and into the alternative dispute resolution arena as possible and to promote co-parenting, parenting plans and so on.  Issues of abuse or domestic violence should be appropriately dealt with and court cases should be fast-tracked and given priority in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Our society discriminates against women, but it discriminates against men in other ways.  If we are to have a family-centred and child-focused system, we must address these problems.  Issues of domestic violence should be given priority and resources should be made available to help the victims.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_241">I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to speak on this issue to determine how best to stamp out the dreadful crime of violence against women and men.  I am glad the Minister of State has chosen to attend in advance of next week's budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I too received much documentation.  While many Senators have aired the statistics, I want to put to the Minister of State the question of whether we are doing enough to handle the situation.  According to the latest figures, more than 9,573 barring orders were made in 2004.  In other research compiled by Women's Aid, it was estimated that between 92% and 97% of women contacted were violently treated domestically.  Imagine the implications on family life and society, the fabric of which is threatened by such an increase in violence.  The Sonas Housing Association, which provides transitional housing for victims of domestic violence, states that between 500 and 1,000 children were forced to use housing refuge to escape from domestic violence in Dublin last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The Minister of State has claimed that €12 million has been provided for the Department of Health and Children's support services, that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is funding voluntary organisations to facilitate accommodation and that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda have been given funding in respect of training to handle domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">However, the reality is that a number of people cannot be helped.  In a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, managers of several refuges in Cork, Dublin, Donegal and Limerick admitted that they must often send women to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or local bed and breakfasts because their centres were full.  Last year, Bray Women’s Refuge turned away 276 women and their 326 children because it did not have enough room.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Imagine a household in which this battering is taking place and a woman, who has a child in her arms and fears for her life, is trying to make a telephone call to a refuge centre to determine whether she can get out of her situation, but no one is on the other end of the line.  This is the reality that the Minister of State should take to the discussions before next week's budget.  We need to put people in centres.  Local authorities should become involved.  I do not care whether they are hole-in-the-wall centres, but the victims should be facilitated in escaping their immediate situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I have also considered how we define domestic violence.  It can take many definitions, as has been outlined in the House today.  It can be physical, sexual and emotional, the last of which is the hidden form and involves the use of power to control a person, isolating that person from family and friends, manipulating children against him or her, embarrassing them to create low self-esteem.  The victim becomes downtrodden and all seems hopeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I am painting a very bleak picture for the Minister of State but I urge him to imagine a man in that situation.  Money is needed to help these people escape because the abuse of which we speak is on the increase in society.  The Minister of State said he was a member of the steering committee and had put forward recommendations to bring perpetrators to justice.  I support that and would do more if I were in the Minister of State's position, though I cannot say in the Chamber what I would actually do to perpetrators.  He proposed an awareness campaign, which I also support, but a woman or man in such a situation tonight should be able to pick up a telephone to find a way out of their plight.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I appeal to the Minister of State to ask for Cabinet approval for resources to fund offices in every urban area so that victims can pick up a telephone and know they have a place to go.  The inability to escape a situation is the reason for many murders, as a person's control disappears under the domination to which they are subjected.  Psychologically, such people are dead and have no way out.  By giving these people a way out we will build up their self-esteem and confidence.  I do not want to read a story in two weeks' time about a person who was unable to connect to a help centre, with horrific consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The Minister of State should stamp out domestic violence by creating awareness and providing the necessary facilities and resources, be they housing, refuges or other facilities run by voluntary organisations to provide an escape route for victims.  The Minister of State is very good at his job and will deliver, which I expect him to do next week.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_250">I apologise but I was unaware that this discussion was taking place and I am not very well briefed.  Yesterday I attended a Council of Europe sub-committee meeting on equality between men and women and domestic violence was the subject of discussion.  In Madrid on Monday a project was relaunched to address domestic violence, particularly against women.  The project, led by the Council of Europe, aims to persuade every Parliament throughout the EU and outside the parameters of the Council of Europe to take a hands-on role in the issue.  Ireland has a parliamentary representative on the project, Deputy Lynch of the Labour Party, so we should hear more from her on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Yesterday's debate followed up on Monday's launch, which I did not attend, and was in line with much of what we have heard in the House during this debate today.  Many speakers yesterday said we were becoming repetitive.  Everyone agrees this is an issue of profound concern and a very serious matter to which Government should respond.  However, the question of what was being done was posed forcefully.  Many of yesterday's speakers listened to speakers on Monday say domestic violence, in particular against women, was shocking.  Many had said something needed to be done but that is an old phrase and many asked yesterday what was actually being done.  We must pose the same question. What action plan has been put in place, to ensure that if this debate is repeated in five years' time it will not rehearse old phrases such as "Something must be done", "The statistics are shocking" and "Domestic violence is dreadful"?</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The challenge facing the Minister of State, his senior Minister and the Government as a whole is to ensure we do more than simply debate the issue by taking action.  The Council of Europe, with the limited budget at its disposal, will focus strongly on this issue and will ask all Parliaments within its remit to ensure that words become action by putting in place solutions so that this dreadful cycle of violence, of which we are all aware, becomes a key area of Government attention, rather than just the basis of statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The statistics in Ireland are shocking, with one in five Irish women having experienced domestic violence and a rate of incidence of 23 per day.  Whatever the policy of this and previous Governments it has failed utterly.  At a time of economic success and the benefits of the Celtic tiger it is frightening to think that this hidden Ireland still exists, in which people are abused and beaten.  I want to hear the Minister of State's plans because the statistics, sadly, speak for themselves  We are all at one on this being unacceptable and on the need for action.  However, as some of my colleagues at European level said yesterday we must go beyond glib clichés and reflections on how awful the situation is.  We must take action and I look forward to substantial action on the part of the Government so that the statistics before the House become part of the history books.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I apologise again for not being more fully briefed but the debate needs to lead to a programme of action rather than a continuing discussion on statistics that are a blight not just on Irish but European society.  If I learned anything in Madrid yesterday it was that this problem was not confined to Ireland, Britain or the EU.  It is Europe-wide and possibly worldwide.  We cannot solve the world's problems but we must start to solve the Irish problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_255">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is not the first occasion on which he has attended to debate this topic and those of us who have followed the work he has done in this area will acknowledge that he has made a tremendous commitment in terms of resources and effective action.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Domestic violence, as the Minister of State said, is one of the hidden crimes in society and some of our statistics are quite alarming.  The National Crime Council, in association with the Economic and Social Research Institute, has found that 29% of women and 26% of men suffer domestic abuse.  Some 13% of women and 13% of men suffer physical abuse, with 29% of women and only 5% of men reporting the abuse to the Garda.  What has been highlighted here is the number of men who are in relationships that are violent and in which they suffer abuse.  We have long recognised, because of the physical differences between males and females, that females have been the victims of violence in relationships over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The figures show that in excess of 300,000 people are directly affected.  That figure probably can be doubled, which amounts to approximately 15% of the population, given that most of the couples will have children and that the normal sized family consists of two children.  Of course, the effects on children, both short-term and long-term, can be extremely negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">It is not dealt with in the reports and has not yet been mentioned in the debate today but such relationships are often indicative of a behavioural disorder in one of the partners.  This is something that obviously requires treatment.  While the emphasis on bringing the perpetrators to justice is obviously essential, I would reverse the mechanisms outlined by the Minister.  I accept the Minister has taken steps to create greater awareness of this problem in society.  The third aim outlined by the Minister was to stamp out the dreadful crime by creating awareness among people of all ages and by changing the culture of anger and violence which can infiltrate intimate partnership relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">In that regard, it is essential that State services and the voluntary sector are encouraged to assist families to overcome difficulties.  I am aware of cases where safety or barring orders were imposed, depending on the advice received by the individuals concerned, which led to the breakdown of the relationship.  In irreconcilable cases that is inevitable but I have also seen instances where people were forced to confront the problem they had with being violent or abusive within the relationship.  They recognised the problem, returned to the marriage or relationship and subsequently the relationships were saved and went on to become close and good relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Obviously, in headline cases where severe physical violence is imposed on individuals — in some instances, murder has been committed — there is a need to protect the victim.  On the other hand, however, in certain instances appropriate intervention by State services can resolve the difficulties being experienced and can lay the foundation for the couple to enjoy a good, stable and loving relationship subsequently.  That should be a strong priority in our intervention mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Only a small proportion of domestic violence cases is brought to the attention of the Garda.  This demonstrates the need to create awareness through education.  Our education system should reflect the need for people to develop harmonious relationships and point out that anything that runs counter to that not only affects the fulfilment of the two individuals concerned but also their children.  It can have damaging lifetime implications for those children.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">In conclusion, I echo the Minister's comment that he wishes to make the criminal justice and other response systems work together in a better way.  That should be the objective and the Minister is committed to achieving it.  In doing that we will hopefully see a reduction in the statistics before us today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_263">Much of what I had intended to say has been said already.  There have been contributions to this debate by Members of all parties.  There is general agreement on the situation and, probably, on what must be done about it.  A great deal remains to be done and in his initial remarks the Minister outlined certain things that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">At the weekend a number of Members were concerned to hear that the Rape Crisis Centre is unable to provide a weekend service in many areas.  There is no sexual assault unit available in my region.  This must be corrected as it has been an issue there for a long time.  Unless specific measures such as these are implemented we cannot claim to meet the needs of victims of domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">With regard to calls to the Women's Aid national free phone helpline — the latest statistics are in its 2005 report — it is worrying that there is an ongoing increase in the number of calls to the helpline.  A breakdown of the statistics gives a fair indication of the situation faced by women.  The callers are mainly women.  There is no denying there is domestic violence against men, carried out by women and by male partners in the case of a male homosexual relationship.  It is time we acknowledged that and examined it.  I note in the submissions received from the Amen group that there is a sense of discrimination against male victims of domestic violence.  If that exists, it cannot be accepted and must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">However, my remarks today will deal with the issue of domestic violence against women and the problem of human trafficking.  The latter was brought to our attention in a graphic and powerful way last week by a number of groups, particularly nuns, operating under the intercongregational <i>ad hoc</i> working group, which operates under the umbrella of CORI and IMU.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Notably, the statistics published by Women's Aid show an increase in the number of calls to the helpline.  In 2005, a total of 25,843 calls were made to the Women's Aid helpline.  That is an increase of 30% on 2004.  The helpline responded to 15,339 calls, an increase of 26% on the 2004 figures.  However, the Women's Aid helpline recorded 10,504 missed calls.  These could not be answered as the service was working to capacity and all support workers were engaged.  This was a 29% increase in the number of calls which could not be answered in 2004.  That is unacceptable.  It is notable that a number of calls to the helpline were made by children.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I agree with what has been said by other speakers.  However, it is important to take note of the issue of trafficking of women.  This is a broader issue than simply domestic violence but it involves violence against women which is perpetrated at an appalling level.  We are currently experiencing a wave of trafficking of women from eastern Europe.  They now represent more than 25% of what is, effectively, a slave trade.  It is a modern form of slavery.  In the 1980s alone, more women and children were enslaved by trafficking from Asia than all the people sold into slavery from Africa during the 400 years of the slave trade.   We are talking about the modern world in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Ratification is urgently needed of the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking of Persons and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking of Human Beings.  Legislation should also be introduced to protect the victims of crime because the fact that Ireland has become a destination for gangs cannot be tolerated.  The Government should introduce measures for rehabilitating survivors and establish an independent monitor to ensure transparency of procedures.  It need not be said that trafficking in persons is a grave violation of human rights, so I urge the Minister of State to make the necessary responses.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFahey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_270">I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate.  Little has been said with which I would not agree and the eloquent arguments made by Members represent an important step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Many of the difficulties surrounding domestic violence arise from the hidden nature of this heinous crime.  Victims are often afraid to report the crimes committed against them, particularly when the violence takes place within the family.  I have met women victims of violence throughout the country who have said their most significant step was building the courage to talk about the violence they suffered.  By speaking out, the weight of their experience was lifted from their shoulders.  Women who are subjected to violence should have the courage to talk to somebody or to make a report to the domestic violence services or the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The culture of male domination remains alive and well in Ireland and is often accepted or taken for granted.  However, as Senators have noted, that culture can be the cause of physical, sexual and mental violence.  Senator Terry referred to the worrying trend whereby 125 women have been murdered in the past ten years, 50% of whom were killed in their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The issue raised by Senator Norris of violence against men was acknowledged in the report of the National Crime Council.  Some 213,000 women and 88,000 men have been victims of violence, so we should not forget that men as well as women are affected by violence.  I welcome that the terrible acts of violence to which Senator Norris referred are being highlighted in this debate because these heinous crimes cannot be tolerated.  A research project in NUI Galway is investigating the length of time involved in bringing the perpetrators of these crimes to justice through the courts.  This matter is a cause of concern to my Department, the Garda and the domestic violence services and we are co-operating with a view to ensuring that perpetrators are brought to justice more quickly than heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Senator Norris also raised the issue of violence against Traveller women.  I agree that the statistics on the number of Traveller women in women's refuges are frightening.  We must tackle the culture of violence in the Traveller community because some of the stories from Traveller women about their treatment are unacceptable.  I agree with Senator Norris in that respect and we are working on the issue on several levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Senator Kett noted that Women's Aid was only able to answer 60% of the calls made to its helpline.  At the end of last year, I sought more money for the organisation so that it could improve its ability to answer calls.  While I was unsuccessful at the time, the Minister was acutely aware of the need for additional resources and the issue has become a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Legislation on these matters is kept under constant review.  Several Senators referred to the court accompaniment scheme which is now being funded.  We are anxious to ensure that a comprehensive service is provided to victims to give them support when they appear in court and I have made applications for extra resources in that regard.  While the training of judges is a matter for the Judiciary, I am aware from the Courts Service that training is constantly being improved and that judges are anxious to be given the opportunity for ongoing training.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The issue of enforced prostitution and trafficking was raised by Senator O'Meara and others.  Ruhama is doing commendable work in this respect.  The issue has been raised in our committee and legislation is forthcoming to address the unacceptable increase in trafficking.  In addition, the Garda is proactive in bringing the organisers of trafficking to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">As Senator Jim Walsh noted, difficulties arise in terms of behavioural disorders.  I have been struck by the number of physical, psychological and sociological problems which arise as a result of domestic violence.  Significant sums of money could be saved on the curative side by investments in prevention to support the ability of organisations to respond to complaints.  Many of the mental illnesses suffered by women are the result of years of abuse.  If we invest more in prevention, we will save a great deal on trying to cure the problems caused every day by mental, physical and sexual violence.  Senator Ormonde mentioned people's need for an immediate response to get them out of the home and to provide them with a refuge.  The women's refuges around the country do very good work.  They are overcrowded and in severe difficulty, but it is also important to understand that a women's refuge should be a last resort and that every effort should be made to ensure the woman can continue to live in the home, with support services provided.  I gave the relevant statistics.  Where necessary, the perpetrator rather than the victim should be removed from the home.  I am strongly of the view that we should ensure that people be allowed to continue to live in their own homes, with a refuge used only as a last resort.  There are issues regarding Travellers in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I would also like to mention cultural issues, particularly the number of foreign nationals in the country and the growth in domestic violence among them.  In some cultures, domestic violence is accepted.  This year we are funding several studies and working with various organisations to deal more effectively with domestic violence in non-national communities.  We are acutely aware of the levels of domestic violence in certain of them, and that is among the issues being addressed by the national committee.  We intend investing more money in researching the issue further and tackling it more effectively.  Of course, given the large increases of recent years in the number of non-national residents, it is a fairly new problem for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate and members of organisations working on the ground for attending.  I acknowledge the wonderful work done by many dedicated people who give of their time and energy in a voluntary capacity.  Were it not for all the dedicated individuals across the country who put in so much effort, the problem would be much more serious.  I acknowledge that it is time for the Government to respond much more generously to those organisations and am hopeful it will happen in this year's budget and Estimates.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_283">Is cúis áthais dom a bheith ar ais arís sa Seanad chun an Bille seo a chur faoi bhráid an Tí.  The British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill 2006 is a short technical amendment to the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.  The amendment concerns one of the North-South bodies, namely, the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB.  I will outline the wider background to this Bill and to the Special EU Programmes Body.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The Good Friday Agreement provided the basis for a balanced political settlement in Northern Ireland.  In particular, it recognised the importance of relationships, including those between North and South on this island and between east and west.  Strand two of the Agreement concerns the institutions committed to developing the relationship between North and South.  The North-South Ministerial Council allows Ministers from both jurisdictions to undertake "consultation, co-operation and action" on matters of mutual interest, to the benefit of the people, North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Agreement also provided for co-operation in a number of specific sectors, to be brought forward by new North-South Implementation Bodies, commonly referred to as the North-South bodies.  Under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, six such bodies were established, namely, the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission; the North-South Language Body, comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency; the Food Safety Promotion Board; InterTradeIreland; Waterways Ireland; and the Special EU Programmes Body.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the provisions of the Act relating to the Special EU Programmes Body.  This body was set up in 1999 with a specific purpose.  At the time of the Good Friday Agreement, international support was generously offered by friends of Ireland overseas, including, in particular, our European partners.  The European Union was strongly committed to supporting the new arrangements.  This support included a commitment to provide substantial funding to develop peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and in the Border area.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">This funding was provided through two programmes — the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and the INTERREG programme.  I will speak in more detail about these programmes later.  Next year, under the new EU financial perspectives, there will be changes in the funding structures for the period 2007 to 2013.  While the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation will continue much as before, the policy areas and objectives covered by the INTERREG programme will be transferred to a new EU territorial co-operation objective.  As a result, the terms used in describing the SEUPB's remit in the 1999 Act become out of date.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">It was always the Government's clear intention that the SEUPB should continue its role in managing these EU funds, and the British Government shared this intention.  The two Governments confirmed this shared understanding through an exchange of letters signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, on 25 July this year.  These letters make clear the joint intention of the two Governments that certain terms used in the 1999 Act, such as "community initiatives", would include "successor, substitute and equivalent programmes, building on the same substantive objectives, priorities, policy areas and activities".  This exchange of letters constituted an international agreement to which this Bill gives domestic legal effect.  In clarifying the references to the new EU funding structures, this legislation will put the SEUPB on a sound footing as it prepares new peace and territorial co-operation programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The Government has consistently sought to bolster and protect the North-South bodies which have had to operate in an often fluid and difficult political climate.  Since the suspension of the institutions in 2002, the North-South Ministerial Council has not been able to meet and the bodies were unable to operate in a manner that would allow them to reach their full potential.  The constraints imposed by suspension make the SEUPB's success all the more remarkable.  The SEUPB is made up of 45 staff with headquarters in Belfast and regional offices in Monaghan and Omagh.  Since its establishment in 1999, it has acted as a conduit for more than €1 billion in funding to 12 counties, North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">In practical terms, this means that 6,500 projects have received funding from the SEUPB.  It has acquired a formidable reputation throughout the European Union as a manager of Structural Funds programmes.  It is widely seen as one of the most competent managing authorities in Europe.  It has met the demanding financial targets set by the EU each year and is used as a model of best practice internationally.  The impact of the funds it manages can be seen throughout Northern Ireland and in the six Border counties — Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The first of the two main funds managed by the SEUPB is the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  It is aimed at promoting reconciliation and helping to build a more peaceful and stable society.  In the past six years, €868 million has been granted to 6,000 projects throughout Northern Ireland and the Border region.  The impact of this funding has transformed the lives of many people of all backgrounds.  Some 45,000 small businesses have received support, resulting in the creation of almost 2,000 jobs.  Some 46,000 people have participated in projects aimed at facilitating reconciliation, peace building, social and urban regeneration, and providing training for children and young people who have been particularly affected by the conflict.  In addition, more than 89,000 people have participated in cross-Border activities.  In these ways, the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation has played a vital part in the peace process in Northern Ireland by providing assistance to support reconciliation and to help the region move towards a more peaceful and stable society.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The second EU programme, INTERREG, is especially focused on addressing the economic and social disadvantage which result from the existence of the Border.  In the past six years, €182 million has been invested in 320 cross-Border projects, with impressive results.  Some 250 jobs have been created or safeguarded through rural initiatives and more than 900 businesses have been helped to expand.  Nearly 3,400 people have participated in training and education initiatives and more than 1,000 health care professionals have been trained in the Border region.  In addition, numerous infrastructure improvements have been made, including the upgrade of the Dublin to Belfast rail line, provision of broadband services along the Border, creation of a virtual technology zone in the north west, port safety navigational improvements and road re-alignment schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The INTERREG programme has helped to create genuine cross-Border partnerships and has greatly improved the economic and social landscape of the Border region.  The distinctively European character of the funding brings a special added value.  By highlighting aspects of our shared identity, it facilitates programmes on a cross-community and cross-Border basis which might otherwise face difficulties.  While much has been achieved with EU funding to date, there is no doubt that the support of the European Union will continue to be important as we move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">We are at a critical juncture in the peace process in Northern Ireland.  While today's legislation is important to its continued effective operation, the SEUPB, like the other North-South bodies, will only be able to reach its full potential in the context of the restoration of the power-sharing institutions, including the North-South Ministerial Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The agreement reached at St. Andrews in October sets out the way for all Northern Irish political parties to commit to the full operation of stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and the restoration of all Good Friday Agreement institutions.  It provides for full support for policing and the criminal justice institutions, including the Northern Ireland Policing Board.  In addition, it sets out specific commitments in areas such as human rights and equality, arrangements for a financial package and a timetable for implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Consistent with the St. Andrews Agreement timetable, the British Government has introduced legislation to make the necessary provisions to allow devolved government to be restored in Northern Ireland in March 2007.  This provides for the electoral endorsement of the St. Andrews Agreement, by way of elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, on 7 March 2007.  The British Government has made clear, however, that an election would only take place in these circumstances, if the parties are working constructively towards participation in a power-sharing Executive by 26 March 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">If it is considered that there is no reasonable prospect of establishing a power-sharing government, the Northern Ireland Assembly can be dissolved at any time before 25 March 2007.  In these circumstances, the two Governments would move immediately to implement new British-Irish partnership arrangements.  On 24 November, we had confirmation that, subject to the outcome of the election and other necessary conditions, Dr. Ian Paisley and Mr. Martin McGuinness would be First and Deputy First Ministers, on restoration in March next.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The process will of course continue to require careful management over the coming weeks and months to bring it to a successful completion.  All parties will have to play their part in ensuring the timetable is met.  For its part, the Government will continue to work in close partnership with the British Government, as well as with all parties, to secure our overriding priority for the restoration of power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">At the same time, recognising the benefits of working together, North and South, the British and Irish Governments are actively strengthening economic co-operation, intensifying co-operation in the planning and delivery of infrastructure on the island, as well as in the provision of public services, such as health care and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Last Friday's attack in Stormont was a sober reminder that there are those who would wish to bring Northern Ireland back to a darker time.  Much has yet to be done to achieve lasting reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  The Special EU Programmes Body has a clear role to play in this.  In managing the EU's financial support over the past seven years, it has played a strong role in promoting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  In recognition of this key role, the Government is ensuring the body's remit is absolutely clear.  The Government believes it and the other North-South implementation bodies will have an important role to play in ensuring the economic benefits of the hoped for new dispensation are widely enjoyed, not only in Northern Ireland, but across the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">As the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for European affairs, I have worked closely with the Special EU Programmes Body, as well as participating in the difficult strand 2 talks.  I commend the work of this unique body, its chief executive, Mr. Colgan, and all of its executive staff.  I commend the Bill to Seanad Éireann.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_302">I welcome the Bill.  While it may be brief and not the most exciting Anglo-Irish legislation, it is vital legislation which I support.  The most important development in Northern Ireland in the past decade has been increased prosperity through trade.  Once trade is revived and prosperity increases, there comes a growing demand across the spectrum for political progress and the establishment of political structures.  Business people, community leaders and citizens in Northern Ireland are leading the drive for political progress.  If we can help in creating further economic development in Northern Ireland, it will put a greater onus on politicians to deliver the endgame of the peace process and to have the political structures up and running as quickly as possible.  Delivery of the peace, prosperity and political dividends runs side by side.  When trying to sell political structures and a political routemap to the people of Northern Ireland, it is important they see the economic dividend.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Sadly for the people of Northern Ireland, they never really had normality.  It is not just about political structures, but having reasonable economic prospects, growth and expansion.  The INTERREG and PEACE programmes are dynamic and help in the building of that normality.  The Minister of State stated 6,000 projects benefitted from the €868 million spent on the PEACE programme.  This represents a large number of projects and communities being touched by the programme.  I understand the Minister of State referred to INTERREG of €182 million.  It is another example of money making a real difference to people's lives.  It will create the normality the people of Northern Ireland are crying out for.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">This necessary Bill will allow the continuation and expansion of these programmes.  In the Anglo-Irish debate, the North-South, strand 2 dimension is often seen as the least exciting.  Excellent work has been done by bodies such as the Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland and Waterways Ireland.  All have played their part in developing the normality I referred to earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">It is important that the House welcomes the progress made with the St. Andrews Agreement and the further steps taken in the past week.  The participants must be encouraged to see the big prize at the end of what has been a puzzle to some.  I do not like to use terms such as "final settlement" or "perfect solution".  In Northern Ireland, where people hold different viewpoints, the idea of one result being the endgame can be dangerous.  The next step is to have the institutions up and running and the Northern parties co-operating.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I welcome the indications given by Dr. Paisley in recent days that if certain agreements in policing and justice are met by Sinn Féin, he will be willing to do political business.  When we think of from where we have come in 30 years, it is extraordinary that we have reached this stage in the political process.  I welcome Sinn Féin becoming involved in policing and justice.  We must encourage the party to take the necessary steps in this regard because there will be difficulties for it in bringing some of its people on board.  That is what political leadership is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The prize for the people of Northern Ireland is too great for there to be any further unnecessary delays.  We hope to see progress over the next few weeks such that the political institutions will be up and running by early spring.  If the institutions can be re-established and the Northern political parties take up the leadership of their own province, it is important that the programmes we are discussing, and which this legislation is designed to promote and defend are available.  It is important to have economic development side by side with proper, fair and balanced, political structures, to create day-to-day normality for the people of Northern Ireland.  Their experience should be no different from that of people in the Republic of Ireland or in Great Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I welcome this legislation, which I am sure this House will pass this afternoon.  I also welcome the St. Andrews Agreement and compliment the two Governments on achieving it.  The agreement has not moved as quickly as we would have wished but in the context of Northern Ireland a short pause for further reflection, and extra effort in trying to bring all strands on side, may be more effective in the long run than rushed or forced solutions.  We are beginning to see a new dawn of realism in the leadership of the DUP and Sinn Féin and a new indication of willingness to compromise and keep the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland at the forefront of their thoughts.  I wish the Bill and the broader peace process well.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Of all the issues that we debate and argue in this House none is more important than Northern Ireland.  The tragedy of that province not just over the past 30 years but over the past 70 or 80 years, with the loss of life, hope and families, is horrific.  Just as the new generation of people and politicians here remember nothing but the Celtic tiger, there are too many people on this island who do not remember how awful life was in Northern Ireland even 15 or 20 years ago.  We must ensure that there is no going back.  Legislation such as we are putting in place and programmes to help the economy play a key role.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_310">I welcome the Bill and the Minister of State.  It is a technical Bill because it gives domestic legal effect to the exchange of letters but if that was all there was to be said it would be sterile.  It is not, however, sterile because it allows the continuation of the Special European Union Programmes Body, SEUPB, under another name.  Those programmes have made a great difference to life in the Border counties and in the North, and to North-South relations.  Apart from the moneys handsomely given and gratefully received, they had a beneficial effect on small businesses, unemployment and many other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I am involved in a programme to bring together women from the Border counties and the North which has received special funding under the EU programmes.  Over the past four years I have gone to the North approximately 12 times because the women are receiving special training.  They hope the funding and training will continue.  On the first occasion I travelled by train and did so again on some subsequent occasions and was struck by the easy camaraderie which had developed between the women from the Border counties and those from the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">I was there earlier this month and was struck again by how women can quickly transcend what are perceived as boundaries between people.  Comhrá na mban works a treat, when women get together, be it in County Galway, Westmeath, Monaghan, Belfast or Derry.  They can be at one in their conversation.  I can vouch for how that money is being spent and is effecting a great change.  People from different counties who would never have dreamt of meeting or had the opportunity to meet are suddenly great friends and make arrangements to meet again for their training.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">One cannot talk about this without talking about the North in general.  I agree with Senator Bradford when he says that of all the issues we discuss here whether in a minor or major way and regardless of the differing points of view expressed, the North always invokes consensus.  I am satisfied that Dr. Paisley who had gone some of the way in the preceding days but faltered at the last jump, took that jump last week.  It was not exactly a <i>volte face</i> but on the Order of Business here we praised his courage.  While harsh reality may have forced him into the decision we do not mind because it happened.  Suddenly “Dr. No” was able to become “Dr. Yes” which was a significant transformation.  The matter must have been difficult for many of his party supporters who had spent their lives working to a certain agenda and who must now work to another agenda.  If all other conditions are followed and if the election follows on 7 March the St. Andrews Agreement will have been worked through</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The Latin tag, <i>festina lente</i>, make haste slowly, often holds true because an accelerated approach would never have worked.  While on many occasions we may have felt impatient as the various agreements and meetings came and went, and various castles were purloined for the meetings, and used effectively, they did mark a short step forward.  It sometimes seemed to be a case of one step forward, two steps back but that was never really so because the engagement continued between officials and the parties who often appeared to be a great distance apart.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I praise the officials from all quarters who have dealt with Northern matters, North-South matters and the British Irish Interparliamentary Body, which has worked remarkably well.  Senator Mooney and I and a few others were in London last week.  I understood that neither the Fine Gael nor Labour members could go.  It was most worthwhile to see in operation what was being done in the name of that body.  Many people and groups have made an input into the process and often the working out of such a process is like fitting all the pieces of a jigsaw together.  The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body is doing that, particularly through its committees, such as committee D which considers long-term Irish emigrants to the United Kingdom, how they live and what difficulties they encounter.  It is extremely fulfilling especially when one realises this has come about because of the Good Friday Agreement and other such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Returning to the Bill, when we were in London last week the corresponding Bill was going through the House of Commons.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain, was responsible for it.  The debate on the Bill was interesting.  As the Bill was going through the House of Commons we were in committee rooms in the same building discussing one of the outcomes of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Every agreement is a step forward.  The omens look good for what will, I hope, be the resolution of the process in March.  I accept we previously stated that and the dawn that broke then was replaced by a murky twilight.  I will cross my fingers and place my trust in all involved in the process that on this occasion there will be a good conclusion to the St. Andrews Agreement.  It is almost ten years since the Good Friday Agreement was reached.  I recall the elation that swept the land on that occasion and the referenda that followed.  We must not forget the horror, devastation, loss of life, cruelty, maiming and injury that went on in the dark years.  We never want to see them again.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister of State for the briefing notes.  The Bill is a positive one allowing for the funding arrangements that were in place to continue and to make the exchange of letters an international agreement in legal terms.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_122">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_319">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.  Bíonn an-áthas orm é a fheiceáil i gcónaí.  Is fear é a bhíonn dáiríre sa Tigh seo, agus is cuimhin liom na blianta ó shin go raibh sé ar fhear de na hAirí Stáit ba luaithe a thosnaigh a ghlacadh le leasuithe do Bhillí sa Tigh seo agus é ag déileáil le Bille faoi leanaí.  Bíonn argóintí eadrainn ó am go ham, ach de ghnáth bíonn se dáiríre faoin Tigh seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The Bill is welcome.  It is a sign of the grown up nature of Irish politics with all of the mutual recriminations that there are profound issues on which there is great consensus.  One of the issues on which consensus has been reached, by and large, is on the way forward for Northern Ireland.  While I accept that the issue involved is simple, this is not the simplest of Bills.  Its purpose is to insert an amendment to amending legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I wish to make a point in the presence of the Cathaoirleach and the Leader.  While the proposed legislation before us is not of a complicated nature, we are at a disadvantage compared with our Dáil colleagues who have computerised access to all legislation in Chamber on their desks.  If a Member of the Dáil wants to examine the context of an amendment, he or she can push a button and do so.  We, in this House, are at a disadvantage, given that we initiate 40% of legislation.  As someone who is certain to remain in this Chamber rather than elsewhere in the Oireachtas, I do not consider this to be fair.  It is time we sorted out this issue.  However, I accept that it is a separate matter.  I raise it solely because the Bill is simple and is not one with which I take issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I have only one query regarding the Bill.  The commencement date is to be decided by the Minister for Finance.  I do not understand how this can be the case, given that the Bill is sponsored by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Members of the House will be sick of hearing about my obsession with the over-reaching power of the Department of Finance and its apparent determination to control everything.  I am keen to hear an explanation for why an amendment to amended legislation which is dealt with in both Houses by the Minister for Foreign Affairs would be introduced into force by the Minister for Finance.  Given the importance of the legislation, surely it should come into force once it has been signed into law by Uachtarán na hÉireann?  I do not see any reason other than the usual reflex of Departments to hold on, just in case</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The Bill is welcome.  The scale of expenditure outlined in the Minister of State's address is extensive.  One of the issues on which we are all agreed is that future expenditure will need to be even greater.  I previously referred to the interesting submission made to the Government by the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland in the context of the forthcoming national development plan, and its creative idea that nowhere in the country should be more than two hours drive from an international airport.  In terms of the north west that would necessitate the construction of an efficient road network in Northern Ireland so that the north west of the Republic, in particular County Donegal, would have access to Belfast International Airport and George Best Belfast City Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">If, as appears to be the case, the Government will be generous in the funding provided for infrastructural investment, this will be beneficial to Northern Ireland and the north west, which is cut off in many ways.  Another infrastructural deficit which has led to Donegal being marginalised is its lack of access to high voltage electricity.  This has had a negative effect on the county's potential attraction for industrial investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The lack of provision of broadband appears to be an issue unique to Ireland.  I am pleased to hear the funding has been used to facilitate broadband access in the Border counties.  Northern Ireland has had 100% broadband access for at least the past six months, something which appears to elude the Government in spite of the announcements it makes.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The Bill provides an opportunity to speak about the future, about which I am extremely optimistic.  For a variety of reasons I anticipated that there would be various hiccups around 24 November.  There has been sufficient ambiguity for some people to be able to say they were bounced into deadlines while, at the same time, they said enough to ensure the deadlines were met without anybody else feeling they were bounced into dissolving anything.  We have this peculiar interregnum where the Northern Ireland Assembly, which was due to either sort out its issues or be dissolved on 24 November, is now in a state of semi-existence with people going as far as was necessary to prevent anything decisive without doing anything decisive quite yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I wish Sinn Féin well and I hope its leadership succeeds in persuading its members to give full, unequivocal support to the police service.  Once that is done, I hope outstanding issues such as the murder of Robert McCartney will be resolved.  It would not be a proper price to pay for peace in Northern Ireland to allow the apparent quasi-paramilitary killing of Robert McCartney to go unpunished.  I hope co-operation with the police will mean the case will be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I am pleased the Leader referred to the role of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which I did not appreciate until I became a member of it.  Its number one achievement is the creation of informal contacts in a way that is unimaginable to those of us who are used to them.  I recall my good friend in the Labour Party, Deputy Seamus Pattison, when celebrating his 45 years as a Member of the other House, talking about trips abroad in the 1960s.  The two questions he was asked when he got home were if he had raised the issue of partition and if he had stayed away from the Brits.  That was the sum total of our attitudes 40 years ago.  We have moved on from that and have recognised that the neighbouring island, with all its wonderful eccentricities and peculiar ways of doing things, the consequence of centuries of peculiar traditions to many of us, has become a good friend of ours and we are able to talk about the peculiarities informally and formally.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Like all parliamentary bodies, the BIIPB is an irritant to Governments, just as parliaments are generally which is why most Governments like to keep their parliaments closed for as long as possible — summer, autumn and winter and, if possible, for longer.  There is a huge hiatus to separating the activities of the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and it is time they were meshed and matched together.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">We were in Belfast for the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body meeting last October.  The city is transformed.</p>

It was a significant occasion in the sense that we were there as parliamentarians from the sovereign Irish Parliament with our colleagues and friends from the sovereign British Parliament at the beginning of a discussion on the Bill which, it is hoped, will lead to the resumption of the institutions and a new era of peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland.  I echo the Leader's comments that we hope a new dawn is about to emerge in that troubled part of the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Like all Members I compliment the leader of the DUP, Dr. Ian Paisley, who, like all political leaders, has difficulties within his party on issues of policy from time to time.  This is a basic policy issue for the DUP.  I never thought I would say in the Irish Parliament that I not only respect but admire the political leadership he has shown over recent days——</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_342">——when it was called for and when, perhaps, there was some doubt that he might not discharge the responsibilities of a responsible political leader in Northern Ireland.  I welcome that.  On the other hand, I fully agree with what Senator Ryan said about the perpetrators of the cruel, horrific murder of Robert McCartney and hope that, like many other unsolved murders in the North, it will be resolved in this new era of hoped-for police co-operation from all sides of the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Another McCartney was in the news last week who did no service whatever not only to his own constituents but to the Unionist population of Northern Ireland.  While he may be a brilliant platform speaker, when the verbiage and hyperbole and the attacks he made on the DUP in the Assembly last week are stripped away, in effect what he is proposing is a return to that sort of darkness to which the Leader referred for all the people not only of Northern Ireland but of this island.  Those are his policies which, thankfully, are dead.  I hope the Unionist population of his constituency in north Down at election time next March will send a powerful message to Mr. McCartney that he is a dinosaur in political terms in Northern Ireland and that he represents nobody but himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I endorse the references made to the British-Irish body.  If the Minister of State has any influence in this regard, there should be a merging of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and the British-Irish Council.  It happened with the Nordic Council and it is working effectively.  That should be the next development in the relationship at parliamentary and ministerial level, North-South and east-west.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I acknowledge the outstanding role the International Fund for Ireland has played in my county of Leitrim and across all the southern and northern Border counties.  It is ironic that when this concept was first developed, that is, the peace and reconciliation fund, with the help and support of the Irish Government at European level it was the Unionist population who were the most reluctant to get involved because they saw it as yet another example of the unification of Ireland by stealth.  How we have moved on.  The peace and reconciliation fund has done outstanding work on both sides of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">When the North-South Implementation Bodies get organised I hope there will be a push for the development of the Ulster Canal.  I was disappointed at the remarks and reply of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, when I raised this issue with him at the recent plenary session of the body when he indicated that there might not be sufficient funds available in the same week our Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, said the Irish Government was prepared to put the necessary resources into it.  I hope there will be a continuation of the pressure on the UK Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">On the question of the all-island economy, which the Bill is indirectly about, we are again in a new era.  To quote Gerry Adams, there is a new dispensation in the land.  Whether people like it or not, we are moving towards an all-island economy.  Unionist businessmen might say it <i>sotto voce</i> and might not wish to go public on it but they know the best way forward for the business community and the development of this island in terms of prosperity for all our people is an all-island economy, and it has little to do with the constitutional issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">So far as I am concerned the Border is an irrelevancy.  I live in a Border county.  It makes no difference to me whatever or to my friends or colleagues in Fermanagh.  The Border is gone so any constitutional issues can be resolved into the future.  In practical terms, what will put bread on the table and give clothing and jobs to people, especially in the disadvantaged areas of Northern Ireland, is the all-island economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The Minister of State was correct to make a small but important reference to the dark forces still within Northern Ireland, as exemplified by the Michael Stone incident.  On a positive note, it was reported in the media that allegedly four UDA groups went out looking for Mr. Stone, who I understand had telephoned a number of media outlets in the days prior to his attack on Stormont seeking publicity, in an attempt to stop him because he was disrupting the peace process.  That is another encouraging sign within the Unionist community who, I believe, are like us and want little more than peace and prosperity for all the people in Ireland.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_350">I too welcome the Minister of State, the Bill and the debate.  If for no other reason it lets me know what goes on in the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, something which is denied to a mere Independent Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The Bill need not take long.  It is clear it is an administrative exercise and the House wants to give a fair wind to it.  It enables us to pay tribute to the work that has been done in this field.  Senator Mooney mentioned the International Fund for Ireland under successive chairmen and also the work that has been done with EU funding.  The important thing is to get in on the ground.  We commend the Governments and political parties for making agreements.  However, these tend to be agreements made between political élites on either side and they need to engage the people on the ground and bring them with them.  That has been the importance of these schemes, which need to continue through independent organisations rather than through Government organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">It is striking that the European programme made people work together and they built up confidence.  Senator Mooney mentioned that some of these matters were viewed with a degree of suspicion by the Unionist and loyalist populations at the time.  These are the people who need reassurance as they see themselves under attack and losing culturally, economically and in every other way, things that are happening anyway but are attributed to political movement.  It is hugely important to reassure them and bring them along.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">All we have done so far is bring the horses to water.  It is important not to frighten them off before they drink.  For this reason, while I wish Dr. Paisley well and he has work to do in his party, I do not want to make it harder for him to bear with the adulation of this House on his back.  Both sides know what needs to be done and should help each other to do it.  Sinn Féin clearly needs to clear up its position on policing, which is a <i> sine qua non</i>.  The only possible policing service there is the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  That force was produced as a result of the Patten reform, in which I declare an interest.  Nevertheless, it is the new model police and there is no point in pretending that any other police service can be invented in the short term to take its place.  Sinn Féin needs and has asked the British Government for the transfer of responsibility for policing to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  People should not be frightened by that — it was envisaged in the Patten report.  I do not believe that Sinn Féin would claim to want a Sinn Féin Minister; any Northern Ireland Minister would do.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">If people want reassurance, the Patten model was designed to insulate day-to-day policing from political interference.  In that sense people should not be afraid.  It is important to let these matters develop in their own time.  They are moving much better than any of us would have hoped some time ago.  The Government has shown encouragement and the Taoiseach has been fairly faultless in his handling of the matter.  People need to be reassured.  We need to underline the primacy of politics.  Politics must be seen to have worked.  If this does not happen, we need only look over the precipice and see Michael Stones on both sides of the political agenda.  It is vital that this be made to work and that the political parties step up to the mark and are seen to do so.  We should give them all the help and encouragement we can.  I welcome the work that has been done.  I welcome the Bill, which, of course, we will support.</p>

          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_355">I also welcome the Bill.  It is short and technical, and as Senator Ryan said, seems to be an amendment to an amendment to an amendment.  I am not sure that an international agreement can be amended in this way without returning to the people in a referendum.  However, if the legal people say it is acceptable, I suppose it is.  Importantly, it will allow funding to continue for cross-Border bodies.  As Senator Ryan said, I would like to see some of the money used for the roads network.  It is possible to drive on a quality road from here to Cavan or Monaghan, but I will be damned if it is possible to get across to Donegal without another road.  I would love to see a main road going right across.  There is one such road along the coast, going up to Dundalk.  However, there is none going across the Six Counties.  As I use this road two or three times a week, I would like to see it improved.  It would be wonderful if the Minister of State could exert his influence to have money from the fund used in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">This represents another step forward.  The jumps Dr. Paisley and Mr. McGuinness have taken since their original standpoints have been phenomenal.  The last time I met Dr. Paisley I had my photograph taken with him and he asked why I wanted to meet him.  I told him that I wanted to meet the next Taoiseach.  He laughed and said it would be a long time coming.  At least he might end up being First Minister in the North in a short time — I hope he will and that Martin McGuinness will be Deputy First Minister.  If those two people sit at a table and talk to one another it will be a long way from what was happening 20 or 30 years ago, when people were being killed and Dr. Paisley was attacking the Pope.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Rather than look back at what we have gone through, I would like to look forward to where we can go.  Senator Mooney said that the Border has gone, which to all intents and purposes is true.  It is possible to drive through without coming across customs posts, etc.  The Border still exists of course.  The North is still a separate country and is part of the United Kingdom.  However, there is a way out of this through the Good Friday Agreement and it can be changed by the will of the majority.  I hope to God some day that will happen and we will have a fully united country.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I do not know why another election in the North is necessary.  The MLAs are in place already and we all know who will be re-elected.  If they sat down and worked it, the position would be quite good at this stage.  I know the way politics works and it is necessary to give a bit and take a bit, which is what this is all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I support the Bill.  Most people do not fully appreciate how much cross-Border work is done and do not know these cross-Border bodies exist.  When I spoke to people about them, they were amazed at their location.  These include the language body, comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency, the Food Safety Promotion Board, etc.  I have a slight difficulty with the Ulster Scots Agency, which implies that Ulster Scots is a language; I would say it is a dialect.  I have no objection to its carrying on.  It is not doing any harm and might be doing considerable good.  Waterways Ireland, covering the whole country, is a marvellous body.  We need to highlight the good that is done.  It is a long haul to where we all hope to get.  Small minnows like this come in from time to time and we do not fully realise the impact they have.  The Bill will provide the funding for the Special EU Programmes Body to continue its important role.  I welcome the Bill and I commend it to the House.</p>

          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_360">I support the Bill.  We all recognise what the EU-supported programmes have done for the Border counties on both sides.  We did not talk about the single greatest impediment to economic and social development, North and South, which was the partition of the country in 1922.  Both countries developed their infrastructure back-to-back as far as the Border and ne'er the twain shall meet.  Ten or 12 years ago the North's road infrastructure was far better than ours.  However, it fell substantially behind ours and only now is it catching up, with the Belfast to Dundalk road matching up with our Dublin to Dundalk road.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">In November 2005 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain, stated the economy in the North would not be sustainable in the long term.  He added: "In future decades it is going to be increasingly difficult to look at the economy of North and South except as a sort of island of Ireland economy."  Last month the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and Peter Hain published a groundbreaking and comprehensive study of the development of an all-Ireland economy.  Civil servants from both sides worked together to produce it.  The Minister and the Secretary of State issued a fantastic joint statement which indicated that the study made clear the strong economic imperative driving North-South co-operation.  In the context of the study, the Minister stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_362">To be globally competitive we must exploit the opportunities of all-island co-operation.  To make the knowledge economy a reality in Ireland, North and South, the opportunities of cross-border co-operation in R&amp;D should be eagerly grasped.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I recently stated on the Order of Business that there was one issue the various political parties in the North had in common.  Sammy Wilson stated in the Northern Ireland Assembly last week that he would like that jurisdiction to have the Republic's low tax base.  Those in the North are looking to us because we are rich.  Business leaders, led by George Quigley, and political parties in the North have been putting pressure on the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, to bring the corporation tax rate in that jurisdiction, 30%, into line with that which obtains here, 12.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The Taoiseach was a guest speaker at the CBI lunch in London on Monday last.  He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_365">There is no reason why the Celtic Tiger cannot be an all-island phenomenon.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_366">The people of Northern Ireland certainly have the capacity and the drive to succeed.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_367">Last month, the British and Irish Governments published a ground-breaking report on the all-island economy.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_368">We want to invest together in the productive capacity and competitiveness of the island — in infrastructure, in education, in skills and in science. We also want to see how we can improve services to our citizens by working better together.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_369">This all-island dimension will be an important part of our new National Development Plan.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_370">I look forward to seeing these plans agreed and implemented — on the basis of mutual respect and for mutual benefit — with a new First Minister, Deputy First Minister ...</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The fact that Martin McGuinness and Dr. Paisley are Deputy First Minister designate and First Minister designate bestows upon them a certain prestige.  Decisions will continue to be made in London until next year but the fact that these two men are now Ministers designate will make a difference when they engage in discussions with civil servants in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Bill has my 100% support.  It is first class legislation and what it envisages must be done.  We are aware of the benefits we have received from the European Union to date in respect of these programmes.  However, I am more interested in the development of an all-Ireland economy.  I want investors from abroad to be able to look at the island of Ireland and see that there is a common corporation tax rate.  The Taoiseach would be supportive of such a development.  We would not be obliged to worry about the competition and would be delighted to work towards the establishment of peace and social justice in Northern Ireland and the development of human rights, North and South.  In that regard, I would welcome the North joining the Celtic tiger economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I do not wish to criticise or offend Senator Maurice Hayes, but structural changes are required in the Northern Ireland economy.  Too many people there are involved in the public sector; not enough are employed in the productive private sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well with the Bill which is very short.  It was referred to by the distinguished Senator Maurice Hayes on the Order of Business when I think he described it as being opaque, but perhaps he was referring to the explanatory memorandum in that regard.  Everyone knows what it involves.  I listened to his contribution on the monitor and noted his reference to bringing horses to water.  I believe he meant to say they should be allowed to drink of their own accord.  His words prompted me to come to the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Everyone knows about the divisions.  Last week I attended a meeting of a sub-committee of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in London and had the honour to be in the House of Commons for the initiation of the debate there.  I heard the contributions of Mark Durkan and Dr. Paisley.  I am amazed by the advances made in such a short period.  I thought everything Mr. Durkan said was eminently sensible but Dr. Paisley struck me as being reticent.  He made a big point of where he stood and the obstacles in his way.  However, RTE aired an interview with him on the night before last in which he more than clarified that he was prepared to take up office as First Minister.  We greatly welcome that development.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I hope Sinn Féin will proceed with its Ard-Fheis because it must move on policing.  It is a basic tenet of any democratic society that there can be only one police force which must have the support of all democratic parties.  I hope there will not be an obstacle in that regard in Northern Ireland.  As Senator Maurice Hayes stated, the transfer of the policing function to the North was envisaged in the Patten report.</p>

While the DUP would not participate in a membership capacity at the meeting to which I refer, its representatives were facilitated in making a formal presentation to the body and participating in a question and answer session.  It had four representatives present — Peter Robinson, his wife, Nigel Dodds and Jeffrey Donaldson — and they all participated.  That was a good indication — I hope it is a forerunner — of the advances that will be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">As the Minister of State indicated, the Bill is part of a facilitation process.  I welcome that and I would not like to say anything that would cause upset.

          <p eId="para_390">I welcome the Bill, which refers to the North-South Implementation Bodies.  It was regrettable that the intended bodies were exchanged with the areas of co-operation in the latter stages of the Belfast Agreement, which meant that the more meaningful and impactive areas of policy became the areas of co-operation.  Nonetheless, I welcome the thrust of the legislation because the Special European Union Programmes Body has made a significant contribution in dealing with issues that arose as a consequence of the Troubles and tackling the question of reconciliation.  I had an interest in commending the body because when I was chairman of the Local Authority Members Association, in conjunction with our counterpart in Northern Ireland, the National Association of Councillors, we developed very good and deep friendships over a number of years which culminated in the establishment of the Confederation of European Councillors on a North-South basis.  It comprised elected members of all the political parties on the island and it was a unique project.  The parties could not have worked together without the assistance and support of the SEUPB.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">While the thrust of the activities involved council exchanges, a yearbook, conferences and dealing with topics of mutual interest, which received a great deal of support, I was saddened by the ill-informed thinking of a number of our media, especially the <i>Irish Independent </i>and “Morning Ireland”, which denigrated a number of conferences held in Europe, and that was a pity.  In one instance, a photographer based in the city where the conference was hosted was sent with instructions to ensure he took photographs of councillors in a social setting.  The intent was to damage the initiative rather than recognise the good being done.  I recall chatting over a drink late at night at one conference with a member of Sinn Féin who had been in the IRA and an Independent Unionist who had been in the UVF.  Both men had served significant terms in prison for bombing offences but their exchange of viewpoints and stories clearly illustrated what could be achieved for the future if people of different political persuasions interacted with each other.  The negative publicity generated by these conferences has undermined them, which is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I welcome the Minister of State's comment that the North-South Ministerial Council will undertake consultation, co-operation and action on all matters of mutual interest to the benefit of the people, North and South.  That is positive because it will address the legacy of the conflict, but I have a strong criticism in this regard.  No effective effort has been made to deal with the issue of collusion and the position of the victims of violence.  Within an hour, a committee of the Houses will issue a report, which will clearly illustrate the volume of evidence it has received outlining the extent of collusion and the fact it was known at the highest level within the police force in the North, the British Army and, regrettably, the Northern Ireland Office and Whitehall.  These murders could not have continued without the acquiescence, if not the direction, of those in senior positions.  While many of the victims are of the opinion that nobody will be brought to justice for these heinous crimes, the least they expect is an apology and an acknowledgement of the collusion and the fact that it should not have happened.  The Government needs to establish an effective mechanism such as an inquiry to get to the bottom of this issue.  Otherwise, it will fester into the future, which would be detrimental to the good relations to which we aspire.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">It also could be detrimental to British interests for a variety of reasons.  First, it would affect the credibility of the British Government in its campaign in the war on terror if it continues to cover up atrocities of its own making in the past.  Second, it would inhibit genuine and trustworthy relations between both jurisdictions and Governments in future.  Third, it would provide recruiting fodder to those who seek to oppose the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  The British have made this mistake in the past and they prolonged the Troubles as a result.  Fourth, it would also mean the British have failed to meet the solemn commitment given in the Belfast Agreement to assist the victims of the Troubles to achieve closure on their pain and suffering.  Many issues of self-interest should encourage the British to co-operate with a strong effort by the Government to bring this sad chapter in our history to a conclusion, thus allowing the victims who suffered to move on.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">I welcome the Minister of State and the legislation.  The peace process and the Special EU Programmes Body for peace and reconciliation have made a useful contribution over recent years.  I have attended a number of conferences under its auspices dealing with specific small projects on both sides of the Border.  At a more general level, one of the positive aspects of the past four or five years has been the ability of the North-South bodies to continue to operate, albeit on a care and maintenance basis.  That is not satisfactory in the long term and their work needs a new political impetus.  I hope that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Last week's events, taken in the round, represent positive progress and there are economic as well as political reasons for this progress.  I accept that the situation is difficult for both of the main protagonists, but we should not forget the other parties, such as the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and the Alliance Party, which have soldiered on without the same traumas experienced by either end of the spectrum.  It is something of a lesson in that if one becomes too extreme in one's opposition, embarrassment will inevitably be felt when one must change position.  This lesson applies equally to the fierce denunciations of the Good Friday Agreement and the notion of power-sharing.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I will not detract from Senator Jim Walsh's comments, but I none the less found slogans such as "SS RUC", as seen in west Belfast, distasteful.  I welcome that both ends of the spectrum are getting to grips with the problem.  Despite the difficulties that some members of both groups will experience, all of the signs are that we can bring the matter to a successful conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">In the past two days, I attended a conference in New Delhi on peace processes around the world, including in the Sudan.  For the first time in my experience of giving a presentation on Northern Ireland, there were no questions.  Compared to many others, there is no doubt that the peace process is seen as successful and hopefully nearing a conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">During the return plane trip, I read an article written by Mr. Richard Haass, the US envoy in the early years of President Bush's presidency and the current president of the Council on Foreign Relations.  His analysis of the Middle East situation was sobering in some ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The article referred to the Irish peace process and recommended that "US officials ought to sit down with Hamas officials, much as they have with the leaders of Sinn Féin, some of whom also led the Irish Republican Army".  That will probably not be very digestible in Washington.  Mr. Haass stated: "Such exchanges should be viewed not as rewarding terrorist tactics but as instruments with the potential to bring behaviour in line with US policy".  One can smile a little at that.  The same article states: "And democratisation is of little use when dealing with radicals whose platforms have no hope of receiving majority support".</p>

          <p eId="para_404">Today's edition of <i>The Irish News</i> states, “Taxpayers’ £11 million bill for RIRA firebombs”.  The Newry bombings cost another £20 million.  As I stated during a debate on other legislation last week, there is a strong security dimension to the issue, but there is also a political dimension and we must find a way of closing down that type of destructive and counterproductive activities and a means of persuasion as well as repression.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_405">I thank Senators for their positive, open, fair, even-handed and focused contributions to this important Bill.  Northern Ireland is probably the most important issue on the island and I value the singular commitment of Senators to ensuring that we treat the matter in a fair, even-handed and sensitive manner.  The Government salutes the House in its commitment to the efforts made by both Governments to bringing lasting peace to the island and equality of opportunity for economic advancement, particularly in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Various Senators raised a number of questions.  Senator Ryan referred to the role of the Department of Finance.  The operating costs of the Special EU Programmes Body are met by the Department and the personnel of its counterpart in Northern Ireland.  While this is a financial instrument, the Department of Foreign Affairs has put it before the House.  I am representing the Department of Foreign Affairs on the basis that it is responsible for activities relating to Northern Ireland and North-South bodies, but the Department of Finance has responsibility for funding.  Any financial Bill or mechanism must have the signature and authorisation of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The programme will be substantial.  This excellent body, which is featured in the legislation, has outstanding staff and will have a budget of almost €1 billion.  It will deliver value for money and is recognised across the European Union as one of the most important management authorities of any funding structure within the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Senator Mooney raised the question of the Ulster Canal.  As the Senator is probably aware, the Taoiseach announced recently that we are planning an ambitious project to restore and reopen the canal to create a major inland waterway for the Border region, which will serve as a focus for tourism and community development.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The first and largest infrastructural project managed by the North and the South was the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, a major waterways programme initiated after we entered office in 1987 and piloted by the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.  Those involved included the United Kingdom Government, the European Union, the International Fund for Ireland, the various Northern Ireland structures, the Office of Public Works and the ESBI.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The project cost almost £20 million, a significant amount of money at the time, but it created a considerable degree of goodwill in the North and the South.  Working together with international support, we created infrastructure and new facilities.  As a result of the major arterial works done, the project created an opportunity for local investment — in the public sector via local authorities and tourism bodies and in the private sector via private investors — to create a new waterways infrastructure that has made a significant economic difference to people in Northern Ireland, along the Border and throughout Ireland as far as the River Shannon.  There is no reason that success cannot be replicated in the case of the Ulster Canal, a project to which we are committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I thank Senator Maurice Hayes for his comments and I salute him for his work and contribution as a shining beacon of positivity for Northern Ireland at every occasion.  Senator Lydon referred to the constitutional position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the legislation.  I assure the House that the Attorney General’s office has been directly involved in the exchange of letters.  The agreements are internationally binding and the legislation, including our management of it, is sound in the transposition of the agreements into domestic law.  There is no difficulty in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Senator White raised the matter of reducing corporation tax in Northern Ireland to bring it into parity with the rate in the Republic of Ireland.  Northern business people, political parties and others have argued that lowering Northern Ireland's corporation rate would help to stimulate growth in the North's economy.  This is a matter for the British Government in the first instance.  Any such proposals would have to be considered in the context of EU rules.  The Government welcomes the fact that the Northern Ireland political parties together are actively pursuing this issue with the British Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Our Government warmly welcomes the level of engagement among the political parties in Northern Ireland to address the economic challenges facing the people of Northern Ireland.  The Government is convinced that stronger economic growth in Northern Ireland can only be of benefit to all citizens on this island, North and South.  We strongly support measures to foster such growth and are constantly working to ensure we can build an all-Ireland economy.  We will need the co-operation of everybody, North and South, to achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Senator Jim Walsh referred to the fact that we have not addressed the issue of collusion and I welcome the fact that the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights is launching its report later this evening.</p>

          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_420">Today is the 31st anniversary of John Francis Hayes who was killed by the bomb at Dublin Airport on 29 November 1975.  Our thoughts are with his family and the families of all the victims.  The issue of collusion haunts our efforts to deal with the past.  It is an issue which the Government has raised persistently with the British Government.  We will, of course, raise the issues in this report with the British Government at the earliest opportunity.  The Government has not yet seen the report and will need to consider its findings fully before deciding how to take its recommendations forward.  However, the Government will continue to meet with victims and families and to assist them in whatever way it can.  For example, the Miami Showband massacre is one of the atrocities examined in the report and the Taoiseach will meet with the families of those victims tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">It is important that the British Government considers the issues raised in this and other Oireachtas reports as a matter of urgency, and that it co-operates fully with any further investigations.  In this regard the final report of the independent commission of investigation into aspects of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the McEntee Commission of Investigation, is expected on 10 December.  We understand that Mr. McEntee has had some success in his contacts with the British Government during his investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I cannot comment at this stage on the recommendations of the report but it will be examined in detail and full and careful consideration will be given to the recommendations contained therein.  The PSNI Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Orde, appeared before the joint committee earlier this month and spoke about the work of the Historical Enquiries Team, which has been charged with investigating over 3,000 deaths.  He emphasised that for a number of reasons, the likelihood of solving cases in a judicial sense is slight.  The situation in this jurisdiction is quite different.  The number of unsolved murders in this State is significantly less than the 3,268 cases which the Historical Enquiries Team will examine and can be addressed on a case-by-case basis, as is happening now with the appointment of a dedicated review team in respect of the murder of the late Séamus Ludlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The Government will continue to offer the Northern Ireland Historical Enquiries Team every assistance in its work and the Garda Síochána has already co-operated with it on a number of cases.  The Garda authorities note also that within the policing plans of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation there is provision for the review of unsolved crimes and there are regular look-back programmes in place in respect of unsolved crimes in other Garda divisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">While we can never undo the hurt victims have suffered we must ensure they do not feel left behind as the political process advances.  In that regard the Government recently decided to extend the term of office of the remembrance commission by a year and to allocate a further €1 million to the remembrance fund.  The commission will also consider carefully how best to address the needs of victims and survivors arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland.  As I said earlier, as soon as the report becomes available we will address its recommendations in detail to the best of our ability.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I thank Senators for the contribution they have made to this very important legislation.  It is my wish to return to the House on its resumption this evening to complete the Committee and Remaining Stages.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">The Minister of State said — I have no doubt he was being truthful — the fund about which this section is concerned "is widely seen as one of the most competent managing authorities in Europe."  Is there a report somewhere to that effect?  If it is one of the best managed funds, it would be interesting to know where that is written down.  I am not trying to be smart but I would like to read it.  Generally, many of funds are badly managed.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">Officials in the Department of Finance have informed me that an audit conducted by the European Commission concluded that the fund was one of the most efficient of these bodies, taking into account the complex environment in which it operates, the disparate range of bodies with which it must deal and the value for money it delivers.

I am surprised at the praise awarded by the Commission, given that the Government regularly gets into hot water over not managing projects properly.  I would have thought a project which was as highly regarded as this would be put on prominent display.

          <p eId="para_431">For reasons of transparency, competition and fairness, the Government cannot declare an intention to spend a certain sum on a public project and no more.  We have to let the market decide what the State must invest to deliver a public project.  A project may change or be expanded and other extraneous influences could add to the cost.  We often encounter trouble in that regard.  However, the Commission has consistently described Ireland as a model for the EU in terms of the way we have achieved value for money for funds distributed through the European Union.  One of the projects which the Commission has analysed from an international perspective has been the fund for Northern Ireland which supports a number of other programmes, including the European Neighbourhood Policy and various other measures across the world.  While a full report has not been produced, the Commission has indicated to the Department of Finance that it is more than pleased with the management of the funds in Northern Ireland in view of all the difficulties involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">I will resist the temptation to follow the Minister of State into the tangents he has described.  However, I take it that he cannot provide me with a report which would support his claims.  I am disappointed with that because this country lacks positive models of agencies which encourage local involvement while also achieving value for money for the public funds they spend.  It would have been useful if a report had been available for future reference in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The nonsense rehearsed by the Minister of State with regard to not revealing what the Government was prepared to pay is only the latest in a list of excuses.  If the Government will not declare what it is prepared to pay, it will make itself vulnerable to claims by bidders that they only agreed on tentative prices.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_434">I raised a question about section 4 on Second Stage and received a reply from the Minister of State.  However, after investigating the matter in the Library, I continue to find it peculiar. The British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 was commenced in the name of the Taoiseach, whereas the commencement of the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Act 1999 was a matter for the Minister for Finance.  If this is a certified money Bill, it should be introduced in the Dáil, as was the case for the aforementioned Acts, because the introduction of such Bills in this House is constitutionally prohibited.  We have entered strange territory when the Department of Foreign Affairs introduces a Bill and the Department of Finance decides on its commencement.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Given that the date of agreement was 25 July, I fail to see why a Bill as simple and overdue as this could not enter into force one week or one day after the President signs it.  The ability of the Department of Finance to extend its tentacles into the business of everybody else is an institutional problem for this country.  That Department had a role in the past in this legislation, so it insists in retaining its influence by keeping for itself the decision when the Bill should enter force.  The Department is only pretending that an excuse exists for delays to the commencement of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">We have been consistent and have conformed to the law and convention on this matter.  The original British-Irish Agreement Act was commenced by the Taoiseach because all the relevant bodies were interlinked under the Government.  Responsibility for funding the bodies has had to be assigned to parent Departments.  The Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, for example, is funded on our side by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  Foras na Gaeilge comes under and is funded by of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Food Safety Promotion Board comes under and is funded by the Department of Health and Children.  InterTradeIreland comes under and is funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Waterways Ireland comes under and is funded by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Special EU Programmes Body is assigned to and funded by the Department of Finance.  As a result, the Bill must be signed and accepted by the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">This is not a money Bill, as we could not initiate one in Seanad Éireann.  It is concerned with changing the rules <i>vis-à-vis </i>changes that have taken place concerning the financial perspectives of the European Union with regard to the creation of a new structure for disbursement of INTERREG funds, as there will now be extraterritorial funds.  Following the passing of the Bill we will be able to co-operate not only with the North of Ireland but with Scotland.  The commencement order was used to manage the process with Northern Ireland in the past, and as soon as the President signs, the Minister for Finance will move to commence the Bill as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">I sincerely thank all the Senators for facilitating and co-operating in the passage of all Stages of this important Bill.  It is technical legislation but important in underpinning the mandate of the Special EU Programmes Body and allowing it to continue its very valuable work.  I have seen at first hand the projects that the Special EU Programmes Body has supported and the impact that it has had on the lives of thousands in Northern Ireland.  The Special EU Programmes Body's work has allowed people to come together on a cross-community and cross-Border basis in a way that had not happened hitherto.  It has facilitated reconciliation and helped the region move towards a more peaceful and stable society.  In addition, it has made a significant contribution to the economic and social landscape of the Border region.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">EU support is very important in the Government's efforts to secure long-lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and on the Border.  I look forward to presenting this Bill to the Dáil shortly.  I hope that it will be equally facilitating so that we can enact the legislation before the end of the year, giving the Special EU Programmes Body a strong mandate to continue its work until the next round of EU funding.  I thank all the Senators and the officials in the various Departments for their co-operation.  This is very important and something to which we are all committed.  With Senators' co-operation, we will have even greater success in future.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_452">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_453">That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to use the opportunity of the forthcoming budget to reform the existing stamp duty regime as a means of helping first-time buyers and those who have an existing house and are seeking to trade down into smaller properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, to the House for this important debate.  I am disappointed, however, that neither the Minister for Finance nor the Minister of State at that Department are present.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">It is my privilege to propose the Fine Gael motion on the stamp duty regime.  I begin by expressing my surprise at the content of the Government's amendment.  Our wide-ranging motion refers specifically to stamp duty with reference to first-time buyers and those wishing to trade down.  The amendment put forward by the Government, however, focuses on income tax, with only one line referring to those wishing to purchase a home.  I had hoped this debate would have afforded us the opportunity to discuss, a week before the budget, the differing views among Government and Opposition Members and also within Government on the subject of stamp duty.  I am especially disappointed that the Government has tabled an amendment which has no relevance whatever to the motion being discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I signalled last week during the debate on the Estimates that one of the main areas in which this Government has failed citizens is in property prices.  The Government has been quick to claim in the past ten years that time began in 1997.  In that year, however, one could buy a house in Dublin city for €88,000.  Outside Dublin, the average price of a house in 1997 was approximately €70,000.  These prices have increased by a multiple of five.  The average price of a house in Dublin is now €424,000, while the national average is more than €310,000.  A huge proportion of that increase goes to the Government in different forms of taxation, including stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The way in which it has neglected those struggling to get on the property ladder is the greatest single indictment of the Government.  Every action it has taken in this area during its time in office, whether the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant or its tinkering with stamp duty provisions some years ago, have had negative effects for those seeking to purchase their first home.  As soon as the exemption threshold was changed to €317,500, for example, the cost of a two-bedroom house in Dublin increased beyond that level.  It is clear that the Government's meddling in this sector of the economy has had disastrous consequences for those who wish to provide themselves with a home.  Striving to ensure that citizens can do so should be a basic principle of any government.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The Government does not even succeed in getting its statistics rights in its amendment to the Fine Gael motion.  The amendment congratulates the Government on ensuring that 80% of income tax earners pay tax at the lower rate.  The statistics are at variance to this.  Up to 31% of PAYE workers still continue to pay the top rate of income tax.  The Government parties' amendment to the motion is factually wrong.  Information garnered in a parliamentary question by one colleague in the other House proves this.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Construction Industry Federation recently pointed out that in excess of 40% of the cost of a new home goes back to the Government in taxation in one form or another.  This figure is continuing to grow despite words to the contrary from different Government spokespersons over the past several years.  Frequently, first-time buyers find themselves with stamp duty bills in excess of €20,000.  This year it was estimated that stamp duty would garner €2.7 billion for the Exchequer.  The actual figure will work out at approximately €3 billion, €1 billion of which will come from residential stamp duty.  Of this figure, just €44 million will come from first-time buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">In September the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated it was his belief that the Government does not need all the revenue earned from stamp duty by people moving from one home to another.  That is correct.  As we face into the budget, the Minister for Finance must consider removing first-time buyers from the stamp duty regime, particularly as they only contribute €44 million to the overall figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I am disappointed the Government parties put down this amendment, particularly as the Progressive Democrats has its own stance on this issue.  I am disappointed the Progressive Democrats Senators will not support the Fine Gael motion which simply asks the Minister for Finance to review the position on stamp duty.  Maybe I should not be surprised by the stance.  A previous Progressive Democrats election manifesto stated there was a need to reform stamp duty.  For five years, the party sat in Government but did nothing by way of positive reform of stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The Government must examine how some of our EU neighbours handle stamp duty on residential property.  In the United Kingdom, stamp duty stands at 3% for residential property under the value of STG£500,000 and 4% for property over that threshold.  In other European countries, the rates are significantly lower.  I ask the Minister for Finance to draft a similar stamp duty system to those of other European states.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The current rate of stamp duty is indefensible.  Despite the efforts of the Government to ignore the issue, it will not go away.  Stamp duty is a large impediment to those trying to get on the first rung of the property ladder.  The Government must do its utmost in next week's budget to ensure this obstacle is significantly reduced if not entirely removed.  I would welcome support from all Members for my motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_464">I second the motion.  This has become a political issue since the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform put his two big feet in it in September.  Having neatly shafted one of his party's most popular politicians — which made him the most unpopular party leader — he announced his views on stamp duty at a press conference after his alleged party think-in.  The only problem was he had no real proposal for it.  I suspect the idea came from cleverer sources in his party.  Nonetheless, he has now backed himself into a corner.  It was amplified by the muddle the Government parties were in last night and this morning over the motion.  It is most unusual that a Private Members' motion, on the day it is to be debated, does not have an amendment on the Order Paper.  This pathetic amendment from the Government parties only came on a Supplementary Order Paper this afternoon.  Until 1 o'clock they were in a huddle deciding which way to go on the motion.  Seven days before the budget and they do not have a position.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_465">Of course not.  We are waiting for the budget.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_466">There is no comfort for them in this pathetic amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I welcome the interest the Progressive Democrats has shown in this area.  However, as Senator John Paul Phelan pointed doubt, after five years in Government it has done nothing in the area.  The only change in the stamp duty regime was a paltry change for first-time buyers last year when the exemption limit was raised slightly.  The Fine Gael Party had argued for this in three previous budget submissions.  In many towns and cities, particularly the Dublin area, people buying average-priced houses must pay up to €70,000 on stamp duty.  It is hurting hard and makes a difference in people's ability to buy a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform broke from collective Cabinet responsibility in September yet still there is no official Progressive Democrats stance on this, only a vague notion.  The Government, at sixes and sevens on the issue due to his remarks, needs to get its act together.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">It will make a difference.  Politicians tampering with stamp duty may only have the effect of raising house prices again.  There is some evidence that the Dublin auction market has stalled since the Tánaiste made his Homer Simpson-like remarks.  Many people have told me they will not buy or sell until the matter of stamp duty is clarified in the upcoming budget.  The most unpopular leader in politics makes his remarks and the housing market goes at a neutral pace for four months while we wait and see what crumb of comfort he can get in the budget.  That is an astonishing act of collective responsibility by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">It is still a ridiculous proposition for the Government to argue that first-time buyers should pay stamp duty at 3% on the price of a property over €317,500.  There is a good case for the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers of both new and second-hand properties, particularly as 10% of the cost of a property, in some cases up to €50,000, must come put up-front.  If the house is over the value of €317,500, already a low price for a house in Dublin, a first-time buyer will be hammered with stamp duty.  There is a good case to be made for the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers because of the particular difficulties they face in the housing market.  My party has long held the view that there is also a good case for older people in large houses who want to trade down.  Some choose not to sell because they do not want to pay tax but might do so if they were not charged stamp duty.  The Government should consider this because it would free up more four or five bedroom houses in which people in their sixties may be living alone or with partners.  That is a sensible and socially desirable action which could have the effect of releasing more large houses onto the urban market.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">A bigger problem is the time when people must pay stamp duty.  It is outrageous that as soon as the price of one's property reaches a certain level one is levied at that rate for the entire cost of the property.  By contrast in Britain there are two rates, applying above and below a certain price level.  People here decide not to trade up because of the significant tax that will be imposed if they choose to further themselves and their families by buying a bigger house.  The Tánaiste claims we do not need the almost €3 billion raised by this duty.  Why then do we not use it in a way that would make a difference as some of these proposals do?</p>
          <p eId="para_472">This Government and its predecessor have made some pathetic interventions in the past nine years that have made no difference to the housing market, except by their ineptitude which has made the situation worse.  What difference did that great guru, Dr. Bacon, make with all his famous reports connected to the economic doctrine of Fianna Fáil?</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I hope the Government takes the opportunity of next week's budget to do something in a sparing and sensible way that makes a difference as against increasing the price of property even more.  The Tánaiste will then hopefully learn the lesson of his rant and rather silly remarks last September and those to which he should have listened sooner.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">I welcome this discussion, which can be only a discussion because any budgetary decisions will be taken in a week's time and the Government does not have a substantive position on tax matters a week before the budget.

          <p eId="para_494">The motion proposes a simplistic solution but one must consider its effect and who will be the real beneficiaries.  The same applied to mortgage interest relief.  There are no property taxes here, bar capital acquisitions tax and so on.  In Britain there is an annual council tax of approximately €1,500 which would add up to a significant sum over ten years, let alone a lifetime.  Homes are not exempt from capital acquisition tax when they are handed on to families.  If they are valued at £300,000 or more one pays tax.

If we give more concessions will we just add to house price inflation and who will benefit from that, the purchaser or the developer?  The second point is important at a time when there are so many demands to improve services.  I heard this morning, for example, about the amount of investment that is required to improve care in private nursing homes.  The same is true of many other areas.

          <p eId="para_516">The question is whether the best time to do it is when one has record numbers of house purchases.  One of the achievements of the Government is the significant increase in the supply of housing by 85,000 units.  I do not know the figure for 1997 off the top of my head but I suspect it was something like half of that number.  The population is rising sharply.  I do not deny the problems faced by first-time buyers but I am concerned that the solutions would help them rather than, as Senator John Paul Phelan so eloquently put it, the Government's meddling making matters worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I am pleased we are discussing this subject.  I suspect if changes are to be made, either now or in the future — we are not just talking about a once-off change in the next budget — it is a matter for ongoing review and the decisions need to be taken carefully and not made in a sweeping manner.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_521">It appears to me that nobody has walked the intellectual tightrope better than Senator Mansergh did this afternoon.  Set the task of defending what is after all pretty well indefensible, he resorted to that great trick of attacking a speech that has not yet been made and, unlike others in the House, is not scripted, so it is difficult to anticipate, and defended a budget that has not been decided upon.  I congratulate him on having done a masterly job.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">He referred, as is absolutely his right, in vague, broad principles about what could be done.  He went a bit further than the amendment to the motion, which I agree with Senator John Paul Phelan is pretty laughable and refuses to tackle the issue.  That will be the conspicuous characteristic of those speeches we will hear from the Government benches.  The Government side is at sixes and sevens on this issue.  They do not know what they think about it and probably have not decided yet.  As Senator Brian Hayes stated, this is a massively politicised issue at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">To be fair to the Government, this is a massively complicated issue.  The abolition of or reduction in stamp duty is not a simple issue.  It is not easy to work out what would happen in certain circumstances.  In fact, nobody knows the answer to that question.  However, certain things should be acknowledged.  The Fine Gael attempt to tackle this issue in an imaginative way is to be applauded.  This is a complicated issue and arguments exist — which have not been made by the Government side because they are frightened of making them, as they do not know what their Minister will do next week and it would leave them flat-footed if they did — to the effect that the abolition of stamp duty would hand the amount forgone to developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">There is also scope for a great deal of imaginative tax reform in this area which might help first-time buyers.  I do not know what would be the effect of the abolition of stamp duty but let us be honest and say that, one way or the other, we are looking for a subsidy for first-time buyers.  I have no problem with that.  Worse people get subsidies than young people who badly need their first house.  I see no point in denying this.  We are saying let us take this cost away from them one way or the other without giving it to the developer.  That is the honest truth of what we are asking.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The Government does not appear to have the scope or the imagination to do that at present.  We are only talking about first-time buyers at this juncture.  They are the most afflicted and the ones who most need to get on the property ladder.  If first-time buyers are not made to pay this stamp duty, the cost to the Exchequer is only €70 million.  That is a pittance.  I recall Senator Mansergh previously referring to €180 million as being a pittance.  We are only talking about €70 million here.  That is nearly a third of what he dismissed as so little in the past.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_527">I will give Senator Mansergh something constructive to say if I keep going.  We are talking about a tiny amount of money to be saved by a large number of people who badly need houses.  Quite honestly, I do not care if this comes about through the abolition of stamp duty, mortgage relief or by injecting that money straight into people's pockets.  This is a justifiable cause and a justifiable expense.  Other than for first-time buyers, stamp duty should be a different kettle of fish.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Senator Mansergh acknowledged one awful inequity — the graded form of stamp duty whereby one pays the full amount rather than paying the steps up.  One goes from 3% to 6% to 9% and then one pays 9% on the whole lot at a reasonably low level.  That is pretty inequitable.  However, I do not think it is inequitable for old people to be exempt from paying stamp duty on the new houses they buy if they trade down.  The reason for this is twofold.  It is quite ingenious on the part of the Fine Gael Party to come up with this idea.  First, it would save old people a certain amount of money but, second, it would get some mobility going in certain areas where old single people occupy large houses and young people with families occupy small houses.  It is as simple as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">We live in a dysfunctional environment.  It would be simple to have a system whereby a person could sell his or her house without paying any capital gains tax if he or she lived in it, move into a smaller house and pay no tax on the move.  People would begin to move, which would allow younger people with families move into larger houses.  In north Dublin and probably in other areas of which I am unaware, there are many old people hanging on in large houses feeling paralysed about moving at their old age because they do not want to spend that 9% or perhaps less on stamp duty and removals.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">That is an imaginative proposal the Government could happily take up and it could also take up the same proposal for disabled people.  It would not cost much and would obviously have a beneficial social effect.  It is not beyond the imagination of anybody in the Government to devise a means whereby a removal of the stamp duty would not go straight into the hands of the developer.  That should be done quickly, in fact, it should be done in next week's budget.  I note Senator Mansergh did not have the mandate to come out and say it would not be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">There are one or two other problems in this market which should be highlighted.  The problems of moving are huge for people, not for first-time buyers.  If one moves from a €1 million house which is not exorbitant any more, one pays auctioneers fees of probably 2%, approximately €20,000, and solicitor's fees of €10,000.  If one moves into an equivalent house it will cost one €90,000 in stamp duty plus the fees.  Therefore, the actual cost of movement in the market is approximately 15%.  What does one expect to happen with these costs?  One expects a certain amount of paralysis and that is what is happening in the market.  As pointed out by Senator John Paul Phelan, rather than moving, people are building small or vast extensions for €45,000 or €50,000 rather than paying the extra stamp duty of €40,000 or €50,000, which means mobility in the housing market is paralysed as well.  People are prohibited and obstructed from moving by this tax.  There is a very good case which the Government will recognise next week but which Senator Mansergh did not recognise today——</p>

          <p eId="para_550">Proposals on stamp duty reform were put forward by the Progressive Democrats, and other parties, despite their initial jitters on the subject, have entered the debate.  Following our considerations in September, stamp duty reform became an issue of political prominence and reductions in tax for low to middle income earners remain a priority for my party as we prepare for the next general election.  The choice for voters after the next general election is clearly between a coalition involving the Progressive Democrats which is committed to tax reductions or a coalition which, at best, is committed to keeping income and corporation tax at current levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">We have focused some attention on the effects of stamp duty on principal primary residence and, particularly, its effect on couples with children seeking to move home.  Among the solutions we discussed were the abolition of stamp duty for moving home, a reduction in stamp duty rates, the banding of stamp duty rates across the rates and the option of allowing stamp duty to be paid over the lifetime of the mortgage.  We recognised and articulated our contention that stamp duty is an issue of huge concern for thousands of home owners and would-be home owners throughout the country.  Furthermore, the Progressive Democrats stated our belief that there is scope for significant adjustment to the stamp duty regime as it pertains to home owners.  We stated clearly our intention to address the issue in our election manifesto which will be published early next year.  This stance is totally in keeping with a party that has always advocated a fair taxation policy.  We must accept that a fair taxation system is not only more just but more successful because with fairness comes compliance and a greater revenue for expenditure on social provision.  I am delighted the parties opposite agree with out taxation policies and concur with our policy for a review of the stamp duty regime.</p>

Imitation, no matter how pale, is the sincerest form of flattery.  It is interesting the House is not considering a motion on sending bold boys into the Army, rewarding good boys with laptops or what to do with teachers who fail their five-year assessment.

          <p eId="para_588">The Senator is welcome to attend.  It is interesting that the print media responded more quickly to the stamp duty issue than did many politicians.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> contributed to the debate by identifying options and monitoring public opinion.  I strongly support the need for reform and changes in the application of stamp duty as set out by my party some months ago.  Such change should be confined to the residential property area and in particular to first-time buyers and couples trading up as well as some trading down via the application of the bands.  For example, application on a tiered basis could reduce the stamp duty paid by up to 50%.  Whatever changes occur we must ensure the benefit does not simply pass on to the developer but clearly goes to home buyers who plan to occupy the house purchased.  Changes must be considered, targeted and effective, delivering benefits to those who currently bear the greatest burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Progressive Democrats were the first to advocate change in the stamp duty regime and we are committed to it.  Political and public opinion supports the change.  In the lead-up to the budget and the subsequent Finance Bill there will always be second-guessing of the Government's intentions.  The Government must consider all its options and what decision it makes must be in the interest of the economy as a whole, including the stabilisation of the housing market.  That is the responsible and correct approach.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_277">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_590">I do not support wholesale across-the-board reductions in stamp duty.  I am proud to be a tax-and-spend social democrat.  In order to improve social services we need to spend public money.  To pretend that we could greatly reduce the rates of stamp duty would be hypocrisy on my part.  In the context of the housing market, an overall reduction putting extra money in everybody's pockets would be a very serious mistake.  If we give people greater capacity to bid up the price, they will bid the price up to the benefit of developers.  Therefore we cannot do this in an across-the-board fashion.  In fairness the motion does not ask us to do that and therefore we can support it.  The motion specifically asks for assistance for first-time buyers.  Nobody in either House would dispute that first-time buyers are finding it pretty difficult as matters stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I used to represent a part of Dublin where the problem is particularly acute — a part of Dublin with which Senator Mansergh has a greater acquaintance than he had some time ago.  I believe I met someone known to him in my locality.  It is now virtually impossible for anybody born and living in Dublin North-Central to stay there and buy a house of their own unless they earn approximately three times the average industrial wage.  Not many people seeking to buy their first house earn such money.  While it is possible to buy some apartments, very few of those are available.  As a result large numbers of young people from my part of the city are required to go to the commuter counties of Kildare, Meath, Westmeath and Louth.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Some interesting academic research shows that many of them are quite happy when they get there.  They put down roots, and their children go to school and happily grow up in Ratoath, Ashbourne and other places.  However, considerable research suggests that some of them are anything but happy.  They are displaced from family and friends.  They are involved in long commutes to work and to social settings to meet their friends.  They leave dormitory towns where virtually nothing happens during the day and they hate it.  This is causing real social resentment among people I meet on a day-to-day basis.  I am sure other Members of the House have had similar experiences.  We need to do something to assist those people in particular to get into the housing market and buy their first houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">I do not agree with the CIF proposal to exempt all houses for first-time buyers, which would be ludicrous.  Those in a position to spend €500,000 on a house are in a position to pay some stamp duty.  However, scope clearly exists to increase the thresholds or to take a number of other measures, some of which have been outlined by my party's finance spokesperson in the other House, Deputy Burton, in recent days.  The measures must be targeted specifically at first-time buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I wish to make some points that others have not made.  There are abuses in the stamp duty regime, avoidance measures being taken by developers in particular, which must be drummed out.  I mention two such measures.  There is a scam whereby developers, without taking legal title to the property, effectively procure a conveyance of land straight from the landowner to the house purchaser.  They do this in effect by getting a licence to build rather than taking conveyance of the land.  The result is that the developer, who in effect is the beneficial owner of a property worth many millions of euro, is paying no stamp duty on it.  I know the Minister has undertaken to review the issue and we need a result fairly quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Another scam is one whereby rather than transferring the land, in effect the shares of a company that owns the land are transferred and capital duty at 1% is paid rather than stamp duty at 9%.  Although this scam is not widely known, it is of a kind that causes enormous resentment.  Ordinary purchasers are required to pay 9% on properties worth more than €635,000 and large companies, developers or wealthy individuals pay nothing or perhaps 1% on properties worth many millions of euro.  It is a classic example of one law for the rich and one law for the not so rich.  I hope the Minister is seriously considering these abuses and will rectify them.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">My party's spokesperson on the environment in the other House is committed to doing something on mortgage interest relief in the event that we are in a position to do so.  An argument exists in favour of giving a particular benefit to first-time buyers.  I am not in favour of an overall increase in mortgage interest relief for everybody, as it would not help greatly.  However, we should benefit first-time buyers in particular, perhaps by permitting them to get mortgage interest relief on all their borrowings and giving relief at the higher rate of tax for everyone concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">While my party has no proposal on the matter, as someone who used to act as a conveyancer on occasion and still does the odd bit, I am conscious that the band system is inequitable, as all other speakers have said.  In the longer term it needs to be reviewed.  I do not suggest that we should reduce the income to the State in doing so.  Owing to the jamming effects it has on the market at the pinch points, it should be reformed in any event.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The motion also mentions trading down.  I am at risk of what Senator Ross would call waffling.  I can see both sides of the argument.  Plenty of people living in my part of the city are sitting on properties that are worth a considerable amount of money and in most cases, I suspect, they are mortgage free.  It would be desirable for them to dispose of those properties and move to smaller properties.  However, I have some sympathy with the view articulated by Senator Mansergh that there is little evidence that the stamp duty liability is stopping them from moving.  I suspect that in many cases they are staying in their own home because they think of it as their home as it has been for 50 years and they do not particularly want to move.  I am not persuaded — although I could be persuaded if my Fine Gael colleagues could manage it — that we should move on that issue.  My instinctive reaction is the same as that of Senator Mansergh.  I am not sure the blockage is where it is suggested.  However, I am open to be persuaded by Fine Gael colleagues in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_601">We need to do this in a focused way and know what are our objectives.  There is a danger — we have witnessed some of it this evening — that it will become a debate between political parties as to who can say the most populist thing.  In that context, we must be conscious of two issues.  First, we must recognise that the housing market is very responsive to what we and our betters in the Lower House say in a way that most other sectors are not and, second, we must accept there is a cost involved.  As officials of the Department of Finance once informed me, this is a nice little earner and it is not necessarily a tax revenue that is guaranteed into the future.  Unlike the position in respect of income tax, which we can reasonably expect to be always on the increase in terms of revenue accruing to the State, it is likely that, at some stage in the future, there will be a slowdown in the housing market and that the take from stamp duty will be significantly reduced.  I do not believe we can afford to be as cavalier in respect of revenue to the State as we might, perhaps, be tempted to be in the months immediately preceding an election.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_602">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this welcome debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">There has been a great deal of comment on stamp duty from different political parties and individuals in recent months in the context of the forthcoming budget on 6 December.  Fianna Fáil has made much progress in respect of stamp duty.  In 2001, there was a zero rate of stamp duty on houses with a value of up to €190,500.  In the budget of December 2005, this rate was extended to properties with a value of up to €317,500.  Those are positive and welcome developments and there will be other opportunities — whether in the budget or in next year's Finance Bill — to introduce more changes in respect of stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">There has been somewhat of a dip in the cost of houses in recent weeks.  However, there remains a shortage of properties.  People have borrowed large amounts to purchase homes and they are obviously keen to discover the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> stamp duty.  In preparing to contribute to the debate, I came across a number of figures relating to those who either are or are not first-time buyers.  For example, on a €600,000 property the stamp duty might be €36,000 for a first-time buyer and it could be €45,000 if the person is not a first-time buyer.  Those are large amounts to be obliged to pay in tax, and we must acknowledge that stamp duty is a tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I become most annoyed when people begin discussing the average cost of houses.  Some of these averages are nonsense.  Certain properties in Dublin change hands for a few million euro, while many houses in rural areas are reasonable and affordable.  As the Minister of State and the Leas-Chathaoirleach are aware, one of the advantages of living in the west is that houses are not as expensive as elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Senators Ross, McDowell and others referred to a certain type of abuse that exists in the property market.  There is a great deal of hype about certain properties.  One matter about which I am upset and in respect of which the Government should take action is the concept of buying off the plans and selling on.  A number of people approached me about this matter in recent weeks.  Some of them were concerned that because they were buying houses which, effectively, were second-hand properties, they might be obliged to pay stamp duty.  However, I explained the situation and informed them that they could have bought two properties and still remained under the €317,500 limit.  There is a great deal of questionable  behaviour in respect of this matter and it should be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I sympathise with Senator John Paul Phelan in respect of people trading down.  In my opinion, there should be greater mobility.  I do not know, however, whether the latter would be the effect of trading down.  This is not rocket science.  The late Eamon de Valera referred to this matter in his own way when he spoke about very large families in the west.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_610">In the event that Senator John Paul Phelan is not aware of it, the late former President and Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, spoke about a family's house — it would probably have been big because there would have been many children — being left to the oldest child and a smaller house built alongside it into which the parents could move.  That was a type of mobility and trading down.  This is why I have some sympathy for Senator John Paul Phelan.  It is difficult to know whether what the Senator said will happen.  Older people are naturally attached to their homes, localities and communities and there may not be a massive amount of mobility.  However, it is important there is a degree of mobility.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I was interested in an article Moore McDowell wrote in respect of a Fine Gael proposal on introducing a new form of SSIA to assist first-time buyers.  This is a good idea because the entire SSIA concept has been extremely successful and people's SSIAs will mature this year and next.  I am concerned, however, that this might emerge as being similar to what happened in respect of the first-time buyer's grant where, unfortunately, developers added on a commensurate amount to the price of houses.  That did not help young people——</p>

          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_615">Mortgage relief is probably a better way to help people who borrow substantial amounts.  If a scheme similar to that relating to SSIAs were introduced in respect of first-time buyers, it would certainly help them to save money.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Many prophets of doom stated that when SSIAs matured, the price of houses would rise.  However, that does not appear to have happened and the trend seems to be moving in the opposite direction.  The insurance sector has issued a warning regarding the consequences that might result if Fine Gael's proposal were accepted.  Like the Minister for Finance, I encourage people to continue saving when the SSIA scheme comes to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">My final point relates to a worrying trend, which has been well publicised in the newspapers, in respect of people we would regard as having good incomes.  Reference was made to the incomes of gardaí, nurses and teachers not being sufficient to allow them to purchase houses in the larger towns and cities.  That is a matter about which one would be concerned.  As Moore McDowell pointed out in his article, at the end of the day one's income must match the price of housing and what is really important is finding a way to extend one's loan or obtain good terms in respect of a fixed loan.  The most important issue is the percentage of one's income one can afford to devote to mortgage payments.  Incomes have risen and that is why the article to which I refer, which concentrated on members of particular professions who were well able to buy houses in the past, is important.  I would be concerned if those people could no longer afford to purchase properties.  However, that is not really the issue we are discussing this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I hope we will continue to have reforms.  A number of changes have been made since 2001 and I hope further changes will be introduced.  I also hope the difficulties young people face will be alleviated by their introduction.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">I welcome the Minister of State, who is present to debate the important issue of stamp duty.  I endorse the points made by Senators John Paul Phelan and Brian Hayes.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">In a typical Irish dance, the Tánaiste, Deputy Michael McDowell, has been advancing and withdrawing in respect of the issue of stamp duty for the past couple of months because he is apparently unsure of the political consequences for himself and his party.  He is keen to avoid making a nasty slip.  A number of slips have been made in respect of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Stamp duty is one of the most emotive issues facing politicians.  First-time buyers and those seeking to trade down and move into smaller homes are falling victim to the cruel and, according to the Tánaiste, unnecessary tax that is stamp duty.  On 18 September, the Tánaiste said the State does not need the money accrued through stamp duty.  Perhaps we should thank God the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was not made Minister for Finance.  Not that that would have been much consolation for the efficient working of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. His performance in that Department can be summed up easily.  He has promised a great deal and delivered very little, for example, in recruitment and resourcing the Garda.  This will come back to haunt him over the years.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">What Government would, in a "dog in the manger" way, insist that hard pressed couples, struggling to get a foot on the property ladder, pay a tax that forces them to face lifelong repayments, yet tell them it is unnecessary and unwanted?  What justice is that?  The Government is ripping us off and it is interfering with the efficient conduct of the property market.  Stamp duty is widely unpopular and a penalty on living and it interferes with the normal movement of people through different property types during their lives.  In the past nine years, the Government has collected €13 billion from home buyers through this controversial tax.  Fine Gael would abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers on properties up to the value of €450,000, while the best the Government can do, in the face of mounting pressure, is consider marginally increasing the stamp duty exemption threshold from €317,500 for first-time buyers, with broad reform unlikely.  Continuing the "dog in the manger" approach, the Minster for Finance is unlikely to bring in sweeping concessions, while the Progressive Democrats, in the face of public opinion, are pushing stamp duty reform, for which they would get the credit, but they will not get their way.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Currently, the rates of stamp-duty applicable in Ireland are less than €127,000, exempt; €127,000 to €190,500 exempt for first-time buyers, 3% full rate; €190,501 to €254,000 exempt for first-time buyers, 4% full rate; €254,001 to €317,500, first-time buyers exempt, 5% full rate; €317,501 to €381,000 first-time buyers 3%, 6% full rate; €381,001 to €635,000, first-time buyers 6%, 7.5% full rate; and more than €635,000, first-time buyers rate 9% ,and 9% full rate.  Second hand houses are exempt from stamp duty for first-time buyers up to the value of €317,000 while a first-time buyer of a property worth more than €635,000 will pay 9% duty.  The percentage of tax receipts from stamp duty has increased considerably in recent years and it represents a greater share of revenue for Ireland than any other European country for which data are available, as pointed out by my colleagues, Senators John Paul Phelan and Brian Hayes.  In Britain, for example, stamp duty is charged at 3% on properties valued at less than Stg£500,000 and 4% on those valued higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">While the exemption threshold amounts in Ireland have been raised <i>ad hoc</i> in the past few years, they have failed to keep pace with property price inflation and the rate at which stamp duty on residential property is charged has led to large revenue gains.  Of last year’s take, approximately €949 million was generated by residential sales and when investors are excluded, it is estimated that €600 million was paid by those buying their first property or trading up.  In contrast, in most other European countries property price inflation has been moderate and-or stamp duty is charged at a fixed level, not as a percentage of the value of the transaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Ireland does not impose a residential property tax and is unique in the EU in this respect.  Stamp duty is a tax on the transfer of property, while residential property tax is a tax on the ownership of property.  A tax on the ownership of an asset does not impinge on the workings of the market as punitively as a tax on its sale or purchase.  Taxes on the transfer of assets are ineffective in that they discourage the operation of the free market and tend to encourage owners of assets to hold on to them longer than they might otherwise consider doing.  The presence of stamp duty will reduce willingness of buyers to pay the reserved price by a certain amount, particularly in the case of first-time buyers, thereby further delaying the point at which the asset can be sold on to the person most likely to develop it to its best use.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Two groups are adversely affected by the imposition of stamp duty — younger people looking to get a foot on the property ladder and those looking to trade up.  Young people can be hardest hit with a stamp duty bill of between €20,000 and €30,000, while established purchasers are looking to trade up to a larger more costly property.  Stamp duty on a €1 million property will cost them a staggering €90,000.  As the Tánaiste and Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has stated, the money collected on residential property could technically be foregone this year.  The Government should, therefore, seek to return the tax for this period rather than just abolishing it.  However, for how many years could a Government throw away more than €1 billion in revenue?  The easiest solution would be to retain the tax in principle but, as Fine Gael is recommending, abolish it for first-time buyers on properties up to the €450,000 and levy stamp duty at a rate of 9% on excess value, which would cost less than €35 million a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Fine Gael would also target proposals for the old and disabled trading down and moving into more suitable accommodation and it is proposing the same exemptions for those over 70 years as for first time-buyers and the abolition of stamp duty on properties under the value of €550,000 for people with disabilities.  Fine Gael is also proposing a house deposit saving scheme, similar to the SSIA scheme, for those saving for a deposit on a first home.</p>

Those on the minimum wage are exempt from tax.  In addition, the tax burden for the married one-earner on average earnings has fallen from 20% to 8% under our watch.  The married one-earner on average earnings has seen his or her annual tax bill fall by almost €1,500 even though his or her annual gross income has increased by more than €12,000 in that time.  Even for those whose tax is calculated at 42%, the effect of the new fairer tax credit system brought in by the Government parties in 1999, combined with the other income tax changes to rates and bands, means that four fifths of earners pay no more than one fifth of their earnings in income tax.  Tax rates have reduced under most tax heads since 1997.  At the same time, the tax yield to the State has continued to rise due to the extra economic activity accompanying this policy.  In some cases, such as capital gains tax and corporation tax, the tax yield increased substantially after rates were cut by us.  This additional tax revenue has been used, among other things, to reduce tax on the ordinary PAYE worker, remove lower income earners from the tax net altogether and fund the provision of increased public services.  This Government's tax policies have been designed to promote the competitiveness of our economy, support enterprise and reward work.  Full employment is tangible evidence of the success of these policies in delivering fairness and dignity to ordinary families.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Under the Government, people are earning more and paying proportionately less tax, there is greater equity in the tax system and more people paying no income tax.  This is a record to be celebrated and a great statement concerning our country.  To give some examples, approximately 80% of people pay less than 20% of their wages in income tax and a one-earner married couple with two children and earning two thirds of the average industrial wage has seen the proportion of its income paid into income tax, PRSI and levies fall from 7.8% in 1997 to 2.8% after budget 2006.  A similar person on the average industrial wage has seen a fall from 20.3% to 7.7%.  For a one-earner married couple with children and earning 150% of the average industrial wage, the fall has been from 24.4% to 16.8%.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Under the age exemption limit system, those aged 65 years or over are exempt from tax up to specified limits.  In 2006, the limits are €17,000 in the case of a single or widowed person and €34,000 in the case of a married couple where at least one person is aged 65 years or over.  For the first time, the highest earners are restricted in the extent to which tax relief can be used in any given year to lower their tax bills.  Following an extensive review last year, most of the property-based reliefs are being phased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Our achievements were accomplished within the constraints of the overarching commitment in the programme for Government regarding the need to pursue a responsible fiscal policy and to maintain the public finances in a healthy condition.  The Government has achieved its objective of exempting those on the minimum wage from income tax.  Prior to the Government gaining power, there was no statutory minimum wage.  The Government's priority in its current term has been to target the available resources for income tax changes at those on low pay, including the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">In international terms, we have maintained a favourable position in recent years.  In each of the years since 2000 for which comparative data are available, Ireland has had the lowest tax rate for a single employee in the European Union and one of the lowest in the OECD.  On a comparative basis, we lead the EU and the OECD in our economic, interest rate, inflation, job creation and house-building performances.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">If one examines who is paying tax, many who are nominally liable at the higher rate effectively pay no more tax than they would at the standard rate.  Allowing for this effect, the latest data indicate that approximately 80% of income earners paid tax at the standard rate in 2006.  Tax credits offset the 42% liability in the cases of all but approximately 20% of income earners.  The data show there are approximately 237,000 income earners, or 11% of all earners, with a marginal tax rate of 42% who pay no more than 20% after their tax credits are applied.  Average taxes paid by the typical worker have fallen consistently during the Government's term as a result of a combination of changes in allowances, credits, bands and rates, which has been made possible through careful management of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Tax rates have fallen to such a point that we have one of the lowest tax rates in the OECD.  A person on the minimum wage is outside the tax net entirely, the average wage earner is on a marginal rate of 20% and taxpayers in the 20% and 42% bands are paying less on average, even as a percentage of their earnings, than was the case in 1997.  For example, the combined effect of tax and wage developments is that after inflation, a one-earner married couple with two children on 67% of the average industrial wage has an extra €63 every week, a similar couple on the average industrial wage has an extra €118 every week and a similar couple earning 150% of the average industrial wage has an extra €139 every week.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Recently, stamp duty arising from residential property has attracted much notice.  As it is levied on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis, the yield has increased as a result of the large increases in house prices that resulted from a number of factors, including the increased demand for housing and the lowering of interest rates, which allowed people to borrow greater amounts.  This year, new house completions are expected to be in the region of 90,000 to 95,000 with a similar number in 2007.  In general, no stamp duty is payable on these houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The House is aware that the 2005 budget introduced a stamp duty-relieving measure for first-time house purchasers who are owner-occupiers of second-hand houses by increasing the stamp duty exemption threshold from €190,500 to €317,500 and by reducing rates for houses valued up to €635,000.  This measure assisted affordability for first-time buyers and helped some first-time buyers who might not otherwise have been able to do so to afford starter homes.  It also helped to open the second-hand market more to first-time buyers who had been increasingly deterred by the impact of stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The reductions in stamp duty for second-hand houses removed the distortion between the new and second-hand markets for first-time buyers by reducing the degree of concentration of first-time buyer demand on the former.  The average price of a second-hand house is often quoted when commenting on stamp duty.  In Dublin, the average price of a second-hand house is quoted at €516,589 in the second quarter of 2006.  However, the fact that half the houses sold in Dublin were sold for less than €381,000 is more relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I will respond to some of the points made by speakers.  In his opening speech, Senator John Paul Phelan referred to how we abolished the first-time buyer's grant and stated that we should not meddle in the stamp duty market.  We carried out a serious examination of the grant and, taking account of the house prices charged and the different taxes paid by purchasers, determined that the net maximum value per house was €500.  Placing restrictions on sizes, capacities, income levels, mortgage developments and so on was unfair to the discretion of purchasers and the market.  That we abolished the grant to free up the market and to ensure that people would have discretion in choosing houses in a modern economy was the proper action to take because it levelled off the market and eased the burden instead of inflating prices——</p>

          <p eId="para_647">There has been greater choice in the market as a result of the action.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Senator Brian Hayes stated that we were tampering with the market in that people who want to trade up will not buy because of "pathetic interventions", but that is not supported by the market or the returns.  Mobility in the market has never been greater and the number of houses traded has never been better.  The facts speak for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Senators Mansergh and Minihan stated that we have a responsibility to maintain a solid, careful and positive fiscal policy that provides returns to the Exchequer, is equitable and fair to the consumer and ensures we can deliver public services across the range of demands in order that the economy continues to prosper.  We must be careful not to distort the overall solidity of the revenue base in our use of tools and mechanisms and our choice of innovations.  It would be foolish to decide to abolish something because, with an election around the corner, it would be politically wise to do so.  When making decisions, we must care for the medium-to long-term interests of our nation and the common good of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Senators Ross and Brian Hayes spoke about politicising stamp duty, but no one on this side of the House is politicising it.  We have made our position clear and we are responsible in what we say.  I do not accept that many old people living in big houses would like to trade up, out or down or that many young people with large families are living in small houses.  The market is not showing such.  I live in remote, rural, rugged and beautiful east County Galway, where the houses being purchased are bigger than ever.  I am sure that is the case in the Senators' own constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I listened with interest to what Senator Ross had to say.  He talked about high professional fees but he is surely not suggesting the State should not receive a commensurate tax to ensure balance in society or that, as individual citizens and collectively, we should not make an equitable contribution to the development of our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I pay special tribute to Senator McDowell, whose speech was very measured, balanced, focused and fair.  He spoke about licensing and share transfer, which we abhor and which the Minister for Finance has asked the Revenue Commissioners to examine.  The Revenue Commissioners are carrying out a detailed analysis at present and will report to the Minister, Deputy Cowen in the new year.  When the report comes forward we will take the necessary action in the Finance Bill.  We do not want distortion in the market but sustainable transparency to ensure fairness for all involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I am sorry Senator Bannon has left.  He accused the Government of ripping off people and wanted to exempt everything up to €450,000.  When his party was last in Government it put stamp duty rates, in Budget 1997, up to 9% on transactions worth €170,000.  We are not ripping off anybody but have reduced personal taxation, corporate taxation and capital gains tax and the returns show we have created stimulus in the economy by doing so.  In year ten, the final year of Mr. McCreevy's tenure as Minister for Finance, we took in more money from the aforesaid taxes than in the nine previous years.  That shows the reductions had a positive impact on the economy by ensuring people could trade and do business, creating a circular transfer of cash resources.  This not only benefitted the individual and the companies which employed our people but also the public services in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">We continue to act in a measured way.  How can Senator Bannon accuse us of ripping off people when the SSIAs were brought in by this Government?  Mr. McCreevy was Minister for Finance at the time and his policies have been continued expertly under the guidance of the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, but we were attacked for bringing in SSIAs and accused of throwing away money and wasting resources.  We created a savings culture in the country and a liquidity and reserve position.  We gave people the opportunity to save and we educated young people in the necessary, traditional values of saving by rewarding them for doing so.  The economy and resources of our country will be all the better for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Far from ripping off people or being mean we have been more than generous, to people individually by means of our tax policies and to the country in general by abolishing many of the impediments to economic activity in the tax system, which had existed for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">A slowdown in the housing market, which has long been predicted, now appears to be happening.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has indicated that he is reluctant to interfere in this area as the market is dynamic and interference could have unintended consequences.  That is a serious statement.  If stamp duty were abolished who is to say prices would not inflate?  The Minister is conscious that any reduction in stamp duty payable by purchasers may lead to higher prices, with no benefit arising to purchasers and at the expense of the Exchequer, as stamp duty has always had a moderating effect on all aspects of our property market over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I hope I have put the matter in context and that Senators understand the Government's position on taxation right across the board.  They can be assured the budget will be fair, equitable, measured and generous.</p>

          <p eId="para_661">The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must have done more to check the housing market in this country in one hour than anybody else has done in the past ten years when he said stamp duty should be abolished completely and that the State could do without the €2 billion it generates.  I do not think anybody on this side of the House has said that stamp duty should be abolished completely.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I support the motion tabled by Senator John Paul Phelan this evening, which is designed to look after the first-time buyer in particular and outlines two ways in which it can be done.  The Government has treated young and first-time buyers with contempt in the past ten years with its record on stamp duty.  Not only did it take away from them the first-time buyer's grant of £3,000, the equivalent of €4,000, it also raised VAT on construction costs by 1.5% from 12% to 13.5%, which amounts to approximately €4,000 for the average house.  What has been the result of that?  The result has been 35-year mortgages and, in the past two years, 120% loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">As Senator John Paul Phelan asked, when the first-time buyer's grant was abolished, did the price of houses come down?  I do not think anybody saw a reduction in house prices.  The first-time buyer's grant of €4,000 was very valuable because it helped purchasers to fit out and furnish their houses and it helped them with many necessities.  Now a person buying a house for the first time must have a 120% mortgage or a 35-year term.  Alternatively, his or her parents must mortgage or remortgage their house to provide the extra finance to provide him or her with a home for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">I am very disappointed with the amendment tabled by the Government.  The Government obviously does not want to speak about stamp duty and has concentrated its efforts on taxation.  In the past four years in particular, 41 stealth taxes have been imposed by this Government.  VAT has risen by 8% in some cases and motor tax by 12%.  Hospital charges are up by 26% and the drug refund scheme by 31%.  VHI costs have risen by 18% and cigarettes and alcohol by 15%.  Bank and credit card charges have risen by 108%.  Bin charges have risen by 29% and ESB costs have soared by 13%.  College fees have risen by 9%, parking fees by 25% and bus fares by 9%.  The TV licence has risen by 40% and there has been a VHI hike of 8.5%.  The drug refund scheme threshold has risen by €8 to €78 and accident and emergency charges have risen by €5, from €40 to €45.  There has been a 15% increase in the cost of private beds in public hospitals and the Government has imposed a €5 increase on the cost of overnight hospital stays, bringing them up to €45 per night with a cap of ten nights per year.  Third level students' registration fees have risen by €80 to €750, the fee for junior certificate examinations has increased by €10 to €82 and the leaving certificate by the same amount to €86.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">These are only half the number of stealth taxes that have been increased in the past three or four years.  The Government speaks about increasing wages and reducing tax but one would need the resources of the Bank of Ireland to live nowadays, as a result of the taxes that have been imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">This is a reasonable motion from Senator Phelan.  I am disappointed the Government has put down an amendment.  In fact, it is not an amendment because it has nothing to do with the motion.  The proposal in the motion would do a great deal for hard pressed young first-time buyers.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">There appears to be a rift between the Government parties on the stamp duty issue, with the Fianna Fáil Party going in one direction and the Progressive Democrats in another.  However, it is not unusual for the Tánaiste, Deputy Michael McDowell, to make wild statements.  When he was an Opposition Member in the early 1990s he stated with regard to the former Minister for Justice, former Deputy Nora Owen, that if he were Minister for Justice he would get rid of the drugs from Mountjoy Prison within six weeks.  After five years as Attorney General and almost five years as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, there are now as many drugs, if not more, in Mountjoy Prison as there were ten or 12 years ago.  One must take the comments of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, with a pinch of salt.  I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, said as much when he rebuffed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with regard to the €2 billion that is badly needed for the economy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_673">First-time buyers face difficulties in today's housing market and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has been examining ways to ease those difficulties, particularly in Dublin.  According to Colin Smith, branch manager of Sherry Fitzgerald, most first-time buyers are spending up to €500,000, a massive amount, on a house.  Given that stamp duty exemption stops at €317,000, it is clear many buyers are unable to avail of this benefit.  That is the rationale for exempting first-time buyers from the duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I am not convinced that simply increasing the threshold would have the desired effect.  We must ensure any reforms put in place in the market are targeted to benefit first-time buyers directly, rather than simply giving an excuse to developers to hike up their prices.  There is always a danger that if extra exemptions are given, prices will rise.  Simply increasing the threshold for stamp duty exemption would be offset by developers increasing their prices to compensate for this concession.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Local authorities should play a more proactive role in the provision of subsidised sites for first-time buyers.  The buyers would then be free to negotiate the best deal for construction rather than be held hostage by developers who just sell for the highest possible price.  A survey by Halifax last September found that key public sector workers, such as nurses, teachers, fire fighters and gardaí, were being priced out of the market in virtually all the State's biggest cities.  In Dublin, homes were found to cost more than 13 times average public sector annual salaries.  This places a massive burden on first-time buyers.  Mortgage repayments over 35 years on a modest house can be well over €2,000 per month in Dublin.  We must examine ways to improve the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The Government acknowledges that there is a difficulty.  How to solve it is the issue.  We have faced many dilemmas in the past and solved them.  Outside Dublin land is difficult to acquire.  The low cost housing scheme, being developed by Mr. Geraghty and others under the national agreement, will bring many houses on stream.  I am not familiar with the greater Dublin area but county councils in areas such as Donegal and Roscommon should be more proactive in acquiring land for housing sites for individual applicants.  This happened in Hawthorn Drive in Roscommon town.  Sites were sold for €20,500.  This brought the cost of a house to approximately €160,000, a manageable price.  However, I cannot persuade the county managers to open their wallets and provide housing sites for individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">If I were a county manager in Roscommon, I would have bought tracts of land throughout the county to provide in the future for young couples looking for houses.  I would not wait for Government initiatives; I certainly would not wait for the Opposition to put forward solutions.  I have great sympathy for the Opposition at present because it is difficult to be in Opposition when there is a strong and active Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">The Cathaoirleach is aware of what is happening in Limerick.  Roscommon is an ordinary county.  It is providing local authority houses of the best quality.  It is also providing local authority sites, where possible, and other subsidised sites and housing.  That is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The biggest difficulty arises in the large cities of Dublin, Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Cork.  The Minister should ensure that sites and land are made available by the State.  The State should release all lands available, whether they are owned by the Army, the local authorities or the Office of Public Works.  In Dublin, the local authorities should examine the possibility of acquiring lands that are not being used by developers.  There is a legal provision whereby they can acquire those estates and lands to provide sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">There is no easy solution to this issue.  Tax exemptions is one means to tackle it.  When I built my first house in 1971, the grant available was roughly 10% of the cost of the house.  It was a big boost at the time.  I was not over-enthusiastic about the removal of the local grants. I considered them an incentive to first-time house builders.  However, they were removed and we must live with the consequences.  It is probably better to provide tax concessions.  In the budget next week the Minister will unveil a package which I believe will be of benefit to first-time buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">This issue is a serious challenge for the State at present.  There are many issues facing the Government, including transport problems and so forth, and providing low cost housing to as many people as possible is another.  If the Government can arrive at a Solomon-like solution, it will be of great benefit.  I do not know  the situation in the constituency in Donegal of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, but, generally, the local authorities have been proactive but not proactive enough.  There is also the influx of immigrants to many areas and they must be also provided with housing.  Simply changing the tax code is a problem.  However, the threshold for stamp duty for new house buyers should be raised to at least €400,000.  That would be a step in the right direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">For the past decade, construction has been this country's lifeblood, with significant revenue and other benefits accruing from the sector.  The 90,000 houses which were built last year produced average fees worth €80,000 for solicitors and architects, as well as 13% profits for builders.  Last year, the construction sector contributed a total of €6.4 billion to the economy.  However, nobody in Government appears willing to ask questions about long-term sustainability.  The blind belief persists that the good times will not end and the construction will remain sustainable.  Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat politicians privately agree the industry is not sustainable, yet they have not introduced any measures to address the problem.  Other industries which were traditionally sustainable, such as fishing and farming, are being ignored.  No strategy has been put in place to divert resources into alternative industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Three weeks ago, Mr. John Bruton shared with this House his perspective as European ambassador to the United States.  We can become blinded as politicians by our work at constituency level but he was a former Taoiseach and is now able to evaluate the country from the outside, which allows him to recognise the risk that our financial capital will be exported.  People are investing in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Poland, or taking their money to Germany or the US.  We should be debating the reasons for this exportation of our financial capital.  We have to find solutions that incentivise the people who made money from the booming Celtic tiger to keep their capital in this country.  We can do that by offering rewards for innovation or investments into public goods such as primary schools and sewerage schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The threshold on stamp duty for first-time buyers must be increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis because the situation varies across the country.  Fine Gael’s policy is to seek ways of abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_689">I support the motion and concur with the points raised by Senator McHugh regarding the construction industry.  Some 20 years ago, the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, stated the country was living beyond its means.  A few months ago, the present Tánaiste claimed the Government was living beyond its needs and should return the money raised from stamp duty.  Next Wednesday, we will learn the Government's opinion on the Tánaiste's philosophy.  Will stamp duty be dramatically overhauled, as suggested by the Progressive Democrats, or will the Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil monopoly on Government power win the day?  The Tánaiste has previously stated that the Progressive Democrats must be either radical or redundant but we will learn next Wednesday whether his party is relevant to this Government's economic policies.  While I support some of the proposals on stamp duty made by the Progressive Democrats, I am unsure whether their suggestions will be enacted next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">There is no point in that party's Members proclaiming they will deal with stamp duty if they are re-elected because they have been in Government for most of the past ten years and, if they are unable to introduce the necessary measures next Wednesday, they will never do so.  Ample evidence is available to support radical reform of stamp duty, particularly in respect of first-time buyers, elderly people who may wish to trade down and disabled people with special housing needs.  Reforms will require political will and courage from the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Rising house prices are creating almost impossible financial barriers to young people who want to get onto the property ladder.  The construction industry may be booming but we have witnessed trends in the past few weeks which suggest a limited downward spiral.  Much of the current uncertainty in the housing market arises from the controversy surrounding the Progressive Democrat Party's policies on stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Fine Gael's motion seeks to help first-time buyers and those who wish to trade down to smaller properties.  Surprisingly, the Government's amendment makes no reference to the motion but instead gives us a mini-lecture on tax reform.  All parties in this House welcome the general reductions that have been made to taxation and we know from the experience of western Europe that low tax economies work best.  However, while we can argue about how low our taxes should be, nobody can disagree that stamp duty is a heavy financial burden on first-time buyers or that reform is urgently needed.  I urge the Minister for Finance to include a package of measures in next week's Budget Statement which will allow young people to get onto the property ladder and permit people to trade down without facing significant financial penalties.  Stamp duty reform must form part of any such package.  Next week's statement from the Minister will determine whether the Progressive Democrats are relevant or redundant.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_693">I thank Senators on all sides of the House for their contributions to tonight's debate.  I am delighted we held a debate on stamp duty, despite the fact that the Government's amendment makes no mention of the issue.  We have had a full and frank exchange of views which has allowed us to expose the differences that exist between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Why did the Government consider it necessary to table an amendment which did not address stamp duty?  The majority of the amendment was devoted to the issue of income tax and only in its last line was reference made to people who wanted to buy houses.  The Minister of State took 30 minutes to deliver a four and a half page speech, four pages of which were concerned with income tax.  He will have plenty of time during next week's Budget Statement to say what he wishes on the issue.  The Minister for Finance, who knows a little more about income tax, spoke on it last week during our debate on the Estimates.  However, why is it that, when we want a full and frank exchange of views on stamp duty, the Government ends up talking about income tax?  I am unsure whether the Government, under the rules of the House, is allowed to change the subject of the motion we were supposed to be debating so completely.  Perhaps that should be taken up by other authorities to change the rules under which the House operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">In Senator Mansergh's remarks, he referred to our not being able to afford to meddle in the property market.  The Government has done so consistently, each time digging us into a deeper hole regarding housing costs.  Whether it was the abolition of the  first-time buyer's grant or the changes made a few years ago regarding stamp duty, immediately afterwards the price of the average two-bedroom house in this city increased to the exemption limit.  It happened virtually the day after the Minister announced the changes in the other House and we debated them in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">In Senator Minihan's contribution, he stated that he supported the Fine Gael motion, although I suspect he will not do so when it comes to the division.  He spoke of a need for stability in the property market, and if one talks to the proverbial dogs in the street, the auctioneers and those currently seeking to buy, they will tell one that the current instability in the market was caused by the Tánaiste's September remarks.  The blame lies solely at his door, and the Government has a brass neck talking about a need for stability in the market.  As soon as the Tánaiste gets a microphone in front of his face, he mouths off about his views on stamp duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Senator Kitt made a good contribution, but he also stated his belief that the  first-time buyer's grant was of no benefit to the group in question.  I would like him to explain that to people trying to buy a house in Galway, given current property prices in the city.  Senator Leyden almost but not quite reiterated his explanation to the House that somehow, once the  first-time buyer's grant had been removed, there was a knock-on benefit for that group.  We did not see a fall in the price being charged to them because developers suddenly noticed that the Government had abolished the grant and realised they could no longer charge €4,500 extra.  It had no positive effect whatsoever.  It was quite negative, since the grant was often used by first-time buyers to fit out their houses, perhaps to get the kitchens done or buy furniture after the purchase.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">I have already mentioned the Minister's contribution, but he stood before us and spoke of how well the property market was working.  There are many categories of people in this city and throughout the country who can no longer afford to buy a house but who could have done so ten years ago.  Regardless of some people's reservations regarding the use of average prices, the fact remains that in this city in 1996, when Fine Gael was last in Government, one could buy an average house for €80,000.  Now the figure is €424,000, and that is the biggest indictment of this Government as we approach the general  election.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Senator Leyden's contribution was the most measured I have heard him deliver in the four and a half years that I have sat in this House.  He acknowledged a serious problem, which he claimed the Government was considering.  However, it has spent ten years doing that.  We had Bacon reports coming out of our ears for the first few years, but we are still told the Government is considering the problem.  Surely that time is now long past.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The Fine Gael policy is clear.  We are in favour of radical alterations to the system regarding first-time buyers.  As Senator Bannon said, we are in favour of an SSIA-type scheme for those hoping to provide themselves with a first house.  We are clearly in favour of a significant reduction in stamp duty for first-time buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">We are also quite clear that there must be an examination of older people in large properties who wish to trade down but are faced by the barrier of stamp duty, for which there is no longer any excuse.  In this city in particular, there are settled older communities that have the local infrastructure of schools, post offices and corner shops.  Often there is only one person in the house, and those schools, post offices and shops are being closed.  In the meantime we are building concrete jungles in Meath, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth for people because houses in settled communities in Dublin do not come on the market regularly enough.  It is clear we must focus afresh on that situation before the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I ask Senators on all sides to consider the motion.  The amendment clearly has nothing whatsoever to do with it, and I appeal in particular to members of the Progressive Democrats, who have a policy position on this, to support the motion.  We do not ask that the Government publish State secrets or give notice of what next Wednesday's budget contains.  However, we request that it conduct a serious and genuine examination of the significant problem that stamp duty poses, especially to those hoping to buy their first homes.</p>

        <heading>Leas Cross Nursing Home Report: Statements. </heading>
        <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_750">I welcome this opportunity to address the Seanad on the important matter of the Leas Cross nursing home report.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, published Professor Des O'Neill's report into the deaths of residents of Leas Cross nursing home on Friday, 10 November 2006.  I deeply regret the upset caused to older people and their families affected by the deficiencies set out in the report.  We are learning lessons from this and the Department of Health and Children and the HSE intend to implement significant changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Many of the recommendations contained in the report relate to standards for long-term residential facilities and to inspections of nursing homes.  I emphasise the safety and well-being of our older citizens are of the utmost importance to both the Department and the HSE.  The Government is committed to ensuring high quality care to all older people in public, private and voluntary nursing homes and is working towards having in place the best standards and inspection processes to achieve this.  Many developments have taken place in the past several months to further improve the quality of life of older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Emphasis has been appropriately placed on developing new nursing home standards.  It is important to note that standards already exist for private nursing homes.  These are set out in the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993, on the basis of which inspections are carried out by the HSE.  The regulations cover several aspects of nursing home care, including health and safety issues. However, they apply only to private nursing homes.  The Department is anxious for the introduction of a new set of standards for long-term residential care for older people.  It was to this end that the Minister established a working group last year to produce draft standards for all long-term residential settings, public, private and voluntary, in conjunction with the relevant bodies.  The Department is in discussion with interim Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on a consultation process on these draft standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The standards are based on legislation, research findings and best practice.  While broad in scope, the standards acknowledge the unique and complex needs of the individual person at the centre of care.  They also acknowledge additional specific knowledge, skills and facilities needed for service providers to deliver a person-centred and comprehensive service that promotes health, well-being and quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The standards are set out in two parts.  The first focuses on the standards concerning the resident as an individual and includes personal identity, social connectedness, rights and health care.  The second focuses on the organisational aspects of the residential care setting and includes management, staffing, care environment and health and safety.  The Health Bill 2006 will establish the HIQA, and will put the social services inspectorate, SSI, on a statutory basis within HIQA.  It is intended that the SSI will be required to monitor residential services provided to older persons against standards adopted or set by HIQA.  This is in accordance with the commitment in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You, to extend the remit of the social services inspectorate to other social services, including residential services for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The fundamental objective of the Health Bill 2006 is to have a health and personal social services system which has quality and safety embedded at all levels and in all settings.  The registration and inspection system for residential services will provide a quality assured residential system for persons in receipt of these services.  The proposed robust inspectorial system will take account of situations where centres are not in compliance with regulations and standards.  It will provide for attaching conditions to registration or cancellation of registration, if appropriate.  This will ensure ultimately only services which are provided in line with the regulations and meet the standards set by HIQA will be allowed to operate.  It is, therefore, a priority to establish HIQA and the office of the chief inspector of social services on a statutory basis.  The Department has been working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and work is at an advanced stage on the draft provisions.  The Bill will be published before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Bill will yield a number of tangible benefits.  It will help ensure all persons receiving services under the Health Acts 1947 to 2006 have them delivered in accordance with quality and safety standards.  It will also have a positive impact on public confidence by enabling persons to have greater confidence in the safety and quality of the health care they and their families receive, especially the safety and quality of the residential services being provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">HIQA's main role will be to enforce internal quality assurance practices at all levels in the health delivery system and, at the same time, bring to bear external quality assurance in an objective manner.  To that end, the Bill ensures quality of services will be monitored and evaluated against transparent standards on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">Safety is the most fundamental aspect of health care quality.  HIQA's proposed functions will include setting and monitoring standards on safety, quality in health and personal social services provided by the HSE or on its behalf and advising the Minister and the HSE on the level of compliance with those standards; carrying out investigations of services provided by the HSE; carrying out assessments to ensure the best outcomes for resources available to the Executive; carrying out assessments of health technologies; evaluating information on health and social services and the health and welfare of the population and advising the Minister and the HSE on deficiencies identified; and setting standards and monitoring compliance with those standards. Other functions relating principally to information technology and management, as referred to in the 2004 national health information strategy will be assigned to HIQA under a future health information Bill being prepared by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The new statutory office of the chief inspector of social services will continue the SSI's work of inspecting residential centres for children in need of care and protection.  The inspectorate has been operating on an administrative basis since 1999 conducting inspections into residential child care services managed by the HSE under the statutory powers contained in the Child Care Act 1991.  The new office, however, will have wide-ranging additional responsibilities including inspecting residential services for persons with a disability and for older people, including public and private nursing homes; registering these services based on regulations provided for in the health Bill or the Child Care Act 1991; inspecting the HSE's foster care services, the scheme for boarding out of older people and the delivery of their pre-school inspection system.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The chief inspector will inspect residential centres for children, older people and people with disabilities for compliance with regulations made by the Minister under the legislation and standards set by the authority.  He or she will have the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration or cancel a registration in the event of non-compliance with the regulations.  The standards in respect of residential centres will be admissible in court in any proceedings taken under the Bill.  The HSE, and those providing services on behalf of it, must have regard to the standards set by HIQA.  HIQA will also be required to monitor compliance with them and report to the Minister and the HSE on the level of compliance found.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The HSE is responsible for carrying out inspections of private nursing homes, and has made many improvements to its nursing home inspections process in the past year.  The HSE has worked on updating the inspection and registration process of nursing homes.  To this end, the HSE established a working group in July 2005 which reported in July 2006.  Among the recommendations of the report was the recruitment of dedicated inspection teams.  These teams should have staff with nursing, medical and mental health experience and have other professional staff available to them, if and when needed.  The inspection teams will all work from the same standardised checklist to ensure conformity across the entire system.  Most importantly, all inspections will be unannounced.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The HSE has made important improvements to its nursing homes inspection process since the working group report was completed.  It has been working on the production of a standard inspection report.  Furthermore, the HSE has commenced publishing nursing home inspection reports.  This is to provide the public with an opportunity to gain information on non-public nursing homes, particularly in the case of individuals who may be considering a nursing home as a future living option.  Information of a confidential nature will not be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Under the Health Bill 2006, it is the intention that responsibility for inspecting both public and private nursing homes will be passed to the SSI.  Accreditation is the longest established and most widely known form of external assessment of health care services throughout the world.  In Ireland, in 2002, the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board, IHSAB, was established as a statutory body.  IHSAB operates to the standards for international validation set by the International Society of Quality in health care, ISQua.  In due course, the IHSAB will be subsumed into the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The IHSAB has developed standards for long-term residential settings.  However, it should be noted that accreditation standards are voluntary.  The IHSAB standards should not be confused with the national standards for residential care, to which I have previously referred.  These national standards are core standards and will therefore apply to each residential unit, whereas the IHSAB standards will apply only to the units which decide to go for accreditation.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The Government is considering policies on long-term care for older people.  Several principles underlying this policy were agreed with the social partners in Towards 2016.  These principles specify, for example, that there should be one standardised national needs assessment for older people needing care.  The use of community and home-based care should be maximised.  Where residential care is required, it should be quality care and there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  The level of support for residential care should not distinguish between care in a public or private facility.  The financial model to support any new arrangements must be also financially sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">It will be clear to the House from what I have outlined that the Government's commitment to older people cannot be denied.  The focus is on supporting older people in their homes and communities for as long as possible, and at the same time supporting those who require residential care, if that is the most appropriate care required.  This Government is committed to ensuring high quality care for all older people in public, private and voluntary nursing homes and is working towards having the best standards and inspection processes in place to achieve this.  By its investment programme this year the Government has demonstrated its commitment to older people.  We acknowledge that we must continue to develop policy in this area to meet the growing demand for services and that we cannot be complacent in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Everything must be done to avoid another Leas Cross.  This Government is committed to developing appropriate structures to ensure our older citizens receive the best possible care in the most appropriate settings in the future.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_768">I welcome the Minister of State and his official to the House.  The Minister of State's last paragraph is laughable.  It takes a great deal of imagination and creativity on his part to talk with a straight face about the Government's commitment to older people.  I was amazed to learn when listening recently to Vincent Browne's show that on 4 July 2001, Deputy O'Dowd, who was then a Member of this House, put down a motion about care of the elderly.  The first paragraph of his speech stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_769">That Seanad Éireann, concerned that elderly people will have appropriate, responsive, accessible and high quality care and supports either at home or in extended care settings, such as nursing homes, calls on the Government immediately to introduce a comprehensive package of care supports, including an independent inspectorate of nursing homes, both private and public, an approved quality training programme for care assistants, and the creation of the office of ombudsman or advocate for the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Senator Glynn was a Member of the House at that time and might recall the debate.  The then Senator O'Dowd referred to nursing staff administering the flu vaccine to patients without medical back-up, and in the absence of emergency drugs, which was contrary to safe practice.  He spoke about a nursing home where there was no doctor's signature for medications given to a named patient.  He quoted the report of an inspection of a home carried out on 22 June 2000, more than six years ago, to the effect that a resident's prescription had not been renewed since November 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The Minister of State's predecessor at the Department of Health and Children, Dr. Moffat, spoke about the Government's policies and commitment to elderly people exactly as the Minister of State did today.  He said Government's policy was "to provide high quality hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home."  Here we are, five years later, in a situation much worse than we ever imagined, as the Leas Cross nursing home has brought home to us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Even Dr. Moffat, the then Minister of State, said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_773">There is concern that while there is provision, as outlined above, under the nursing home legislation for monitoring standards in private nursing homes, no similar arrangements are in place for health board facilities, an issue both I and my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, will rectify. As Members will be aware, the social services inspectorate has the authority to monitor standards in children's residential centres and is operating effectively. It is intended to expand its role to cover extended care facilities for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">It is like Groundhog Day all over again but five years have passed and people have paid, in some cases with their lives, for this neglect.  It is shocking to think that some people may have died from renal failure due to dehydration where nurses and staff in nursing homes were not aware these people were dehydrated.  If we saw that happening in another country we would call for resources to be put into the country or withdrawn, depending on the context.  It is happening here, where our elderly people are denied the dignity they deserve.  They are the people who founded the State in difficult times but my generation has never had it so good.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">The Minister of State referred to publication of the reports but the HSE has covered only part of the country, and published only some reports on its website.  This is still hit and miss because there is not 100% coverage.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">I will not enter the debate this evening about private versus public homes.  I make no bones about saying I am in favour of private nursing homes.  Only for that scheme there would not be half the number of nursing homes there are, and they would not be in their present locations.  In County Carlow there are fantastic nursing homes in Tullow Road, Leighlinbridge and Ballon.  I would be terrified that if this were left to the public sector the homes would not be built in the first place and if they were they would be located in major urban areas.  It is great that people who have to go to nursing homes are able to reside near their homes because it also makes it easier for family members to visit them.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The O'Neill report on the Leas Cross nursing home points to the need for the Government to set in place minimum staff levels.  There may be only one nurse on duty in a nursing home.  That is not acceptable.  There should be clear guidelines on the minimum number of staff required and on inspectors and the number of their visits.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">When Dr. Aidan Browne recently addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children he explained that there are 54 inspectors going around the country and that they visit private nursing homes twice a year.  The number of farms is similar to the number of people in nursing homes, at approximately 18,000 but there are only 54 nursing home inspectors, divided into 18 teams of three.  I was shocked to learn, from a response to a question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food yesterday, that in her Department there are 1,685 inspectors.  There is almost one inspector for every 11 farms while in nursing homes there is one inspector for every 370 patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">If someone gets food poisoning in a nursing home or the food preparation area is not clean the nursing home can be closed down instantly.  Malpractice in the care of the patient, however, can continue without swift remedial action.  It took a "Prime Time" programme, and my colleague Deputy O'Dowd who has been raising this issue for years, to expose the scandal in a few nursing homes.  It is worth putting on record that many nursing homes offer an excellent service.  We were all shocked by the contents of the "Prime Time" programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Was the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, briefed or warned specifically about the major problems in nursing homes, on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children?  Dr. Aidan Browne stated at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that the current Act and regulations are cumbersome and that it has been recognised for some time that new legislation and regulations are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Many people have been baffled by the slow response of the Government.  The "Prime Time" programme to which I referred was aired more than 18 months ago.  In contrast, almost two years ago the Government rushed emergency legislation through this House on nursing home charges.  Thankfully, that legislation was rejected by the Supreme Court.  Almost 18 months later we are still hearing about the inspectorate and other issues relating to nursing homes.  The Government is very quick to charge pensioners in nursing homes but very slow to bring in safeguards to protect them while in the care of these same nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">It is shocking to compare the number of inspectors in the Department of Agriculture and Food with the number of nursing home inspectors.  We need to set minimum guidelines.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure all inspection reports are made available immediately on the Health Service Executive website so that people are made fully aware of the conditions in individual nursing homes.  If any of us were planning a weekend away, we would find out how many stars a hotel had and what facilities were available there.  People who want to find a nursing home for themselves or a relative should have the same option but that has not been the case to date.  It is vital that nursing homes are brought up to the highest specifications.  It is the least we deserve as we get older.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_783">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power.  We must acknowledge the work carried out in the report on the Leas Cross nursing home by Professor Des O'Neill.  I am pleased to hear the Department of Health and Children and the HSE will work to implement his recommendations.  The failings in care for older people described in the report are deeply distressing.  They show a complete lack of respect for older people and their dignity.  These people were the founders of the State and the ones who worked in adverse circumstances to make the country what it is today.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">In this instance and in others, older people in care and their families were badly let down; in fact, they were betrayed.  I deeply regret the distress it has caused them.  The fact that the nursing home in question is now closed in respect of the previous management is some small measure, but it is of little comfort to the relatives of those whose loved ones were failed so badly.  It is clear that warning signs and complaints were not given the attention they were due.  It is vital that the Government leads the legislative actions and funding decisions to ensure that high standards of care are upheld in all nursing homes, both public and private.  It is clear from Professor O'Neill's report and from previous reports that complaints and warnings were not given the attention they warranted.  This is a matter of deep regret.  This is another example of a problem that dates from the mid-1970s that was not dealt with and eventually became impossible to ignore.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_791">We will deal with that later.  I wish to refer to visiting committees.  I was a member of a health board for approximately 23 years.  It puzzled me that as a member of a health board I was entitled to visit public nursing homes but not private nursing homes.  Although they were also receiving subvention from the public purse, we were not able to visit them.  However, if one examines how many public nursing home facilities fell into the same category as Leas Cross, the answer is none.  I accept that money can be made from private nursing homes but let us be clear.  It is patently obvious that a number of those institutions were profit-driven and the comfort and care of the residents came a bad second place.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_793">There is no point in codding ourselves about that.  Senator Browne made a surprising remark to the effect that nursing staff were not aware that patients were dehydrated.  Any member of the nursing profession who is caring for people, especially elderly people, and does not know whether a patient is dehydrated should not be working as a nurse.  He or she should be struck off.  Whatever happened to the use of fluid balance charts, bowel charts, TPR charts and blood pressure charts, etc?  If a patient is non-ambulant, it is obvious that the only liquid he or she will ingest is what is given to him or him either orally, by Ryles tube or intravenously.  It is not sufficient to state that a member of the nursing staff would be unaware of whether a patient is dehydrated.  If that were the case, the nurse in question would not be doing his or her duty.  If nursing staff are unaware of what were previously known as intake and output charts but are now referred to as fluid balance charts, bowel charts etc., it is clear they do not know their job and should not be doing such work.  It annoys me that such a situation obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Two and a quarter hours is very little time for a debate of this magnitude.  We should revisit this report as it contains a significant amount of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">Senator Browne made an important point about staffing levels.  The level of staffing in geriatric medicine is most important as it is a labour intensive nursing discipline.  Sufficient staff are required because, as people get older, they become more limited in their movements or may become completely debilitated.  Mechanical aids are now available for lifting elderly patients but a high degree of personal input is also required by nursing and care staff.  Therefore, if a ward is short-staffed, even by one member, regardless of his or her level of expertise, this can result in serious problems for the level of care offered to patients and also impact on the staff in that proper health and safety standards can be compromised.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The care of pressure areas is of the utmost importance for non-ambulant patients confined to bed.  It is not rocket science.  Any student nurse in his or her first two weeks would be shown how to treat pressure areas.  One must ensure that the patient is turned, that the position is changed regularly and that the various pressure areas such as the heels, buttocks, shoulders, elbows and hips are not left in the one position for any length of time.  Those areas to which I have referred should be also massaged with soap and water.  That would not involve a huge cost.  The application of barrier cream and other such preparations would compliment and ensure the retention of the elasticity of the skin.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">It is clear from the report that normal nursing practices were not followed.  Nobody can tell me that all this happened under the noses of doctors and senior nursing staff.  It is obvious people were not doing their job.  The Minister is right; this issue must be dealt with in the context of legislation.  It is depressing to say the least.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">On the issue of the visiting committees, I always took the view when I was a member of the Midland Health Board and part of a visiting committee to St. Dympna's in Carlow, St. Loman's and St. Mary's in Mullingar, St. Vincent's in Mountmellick or wherever, that if Senator Browne and Senator White visited as members of the relevant health board, invariably there would be people in the institution who would recognise them and the visiting politicians would recognise the people.  That was a friendly face and another contact.  There would always be conversation between the visiting committee and those in the institution and it was of great therapeutic value to the patients.  A few years ago, I recall reading the reports of visiting committees prior to the establishment of the health boards when members of the visiting committees were critical of standards observed in the course of their visit.  Those institutions were revisited time and again until the problems were addressed.  Sometimes change is not always for the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">It is clear from Professor O'Neill's report that he did not engage in an exercise of blame nor did he recommend disciplinary action.  Some people involved have challenged his assessment.  The report has been sent to the Garda and the Medical Council for their consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The HSE is right to say that his work with the local inspector to achieve an improvement in care standards was ineffective.  However, similar work undertaken by the same team and other teams elsewhere have been very effective in other care settings.  The majority of care settings provide high quality, safe care to the residents, and they and their families are happy with the care provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">There may be a misconception about staffing levels in certain care institutions.  It is important to have appropriately trained staff and good care staff.  Some basic training is important, a matter to which the Minister of State referred.  The basic care models are very important in a geriatric nursing centre and can provide the people concerned with a good quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I sincerely regret, and it is a matter of regret to every Member of this and the other House, that deficiencies occurred.  I hope we never have to consider such a report again.  Clearly there were failings.  I am not convinced that those at management level in that institution were doing their job.  If they had done their job properly, this would not have happened.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_803">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.  Mar is gnáth nuair a phléimid an cheist seo, I must say something.  My mother is in a public old people's hospital in my home town of Athy.  Would that all our old people were in receipt of the quality of care provided at St. Vincent's in Athy.  If the HSE wants a model of good practice, it does not have to get involved in complicated, complex, time-consuming and slow pilot projects.  It has models that work very well to the satisfaction of patients and families and those who visit.  I happen to know one and I am sure there are many others.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">I do not want to rehearse the horrors of Leas Cross because they have been rehearsed time and again.  I did not hear the Minister of State but I read his script.  I note the absence of reference to most of the recommendations in the Leas Cross report and considerable emphasis on one issue, that of standards, which is important.  We are in danger, as we are often, of the legislative response to a crisis which is to set up a raft of complicated legal procedures and then forget the implementation of those requirements costs a great deal of money.  I want to put on the record a little from the report and a good deal from what the HSE supplied Members on the recommendations and what it was doing or, as the case may have been, not doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">There is a tendency in the HSE's commentary on Leas Cross to give the impression that this matter sprang on it out of a blue sky without any serious prior warning.  That is nonsense.  I have no idea whether it got lost in the transfer of documents or files or whatever.  As the report states, Years Ahead was published in 1983 and as Professor O'Neill said 23 years after it was made official health policy, its recommendation for an independent inspectorate for residential care remains unfulfilled.  I fully accept that is the fault of a number of Governments but we are in a unique period in this country's history in that we have had the same Government for ten years and one that has had at its disposal resources which were undreamed of by any previous Government.  Of the 23 years, ten have been the period of this Government when it did not have the excuse that Governments of all hues of the 1980s and early 1990s had, namely, that resources were scarce and were being consumed by an armed uprising that spilled over to this part of the island and which incurred substantial damage and cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I continue to wonder how long it will take the Government to stop looking back over the horizon of previous Governments.  It is ten years in office and considering that the official lifespan of a politician is 20 years — that is when we are allowed to retire on full pension — half the lifespan of a politician is about the time when a Government should stop talking about what its predecessors did or did not do.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Professor O'Neill referred to the health strategy of 2001, its wonderful improved staffing levels and extended care units, the extended remit of the social services inspectorate, and national standards for community and long-term residential care of older people.  The latter issue has always raised for me one question.  How was it that a health strategy that was compiled in 2001 which referred to those issues never asked how it would be paid for?  Clearly if one asked how it would be done, one would look at the legislation and the issue that arose for the Minister, Deputy Harney, but which was conveniently not noticed by her predecessor.  How in heaven's name an otherwise very intelligent man managed not to wonder about paying for all that is beyond me.  It is also beyond everybody else and I have my own explanation.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">What Professor O'Neill's report stated about the health strategy was: "No documentation has been offered to me suggesting movement on these objectives prior to the Leas Cross Prime Time programme".  It launched the strategy with rhetoric and did absolutely nothing for five years until it was shamed into it by a television programme.  The report continued: "The deeply deficient Nursing Home Legislation and Regulations have been tolerated well beyond what the time span...".  We now know this and have known it for some time.  The report further stated: "it was with some surprise that the reviewer noted a claim in the OECD overview of long term care that Ireland has put into place national standards of care".  Not only were we conning the public at home, we were also conning the OECD by informing it we had done things we had not done.  The report continued: "A Cabinet Member ... is documented as being briefed on these deficiencies on 30/5/2005, and the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health and Children received a comprehensive memo on the grave deficiencies of the current legislation/regulations on 24/5/2005".</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Professor O'Neill went on to make a succession of recommendations, most of which were ignored in the speech of the Minister of State.  Let me go through some of them.  "The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive must in its policy, as a matter of urgency, clearly and formally articulate its recognition of the complex health and social care needs".  The response to this recommendation was:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_810">A report of current and future long term needs has recently been completed as part of an interdepartmental working group on the funding of Long Term Care.  A national forum with HSE and Nursing Homes representatives is working on a number of quality initiatives including the development of service level agreements.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_816">My view is of a monumentally incompetent Department run by monumentally incompetent Ministers and a monumentally incompetent HSE which blames systems failures for everything.  Systems failures mean that the managers cannot or will not manage.  They mean that the people in charge did not devise proper systems, ignored problems until they blew up in their faces and then blamed everybody else except themselves for the consequences.  They now want us all to wait while they get around to formulating the policy they announced five years ago and never implemented.  That is my view.  Those responsible for this debacle should at least show some urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Recommendation No. 4 reads: "Funding arrangements for nursing home care should be urgently reviewed".  The response reads: "Work is ongoing".  Give us a break.  Work has been ongoing on this issue since the 1990s.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Recommendation No. 5 reads: "The Nursing Home Legislation needs to be urgently updated".  The Department of Health and Children's view of the words "urgently" is sometime this year or maybe next year.  I do not know what the word means when the report highlights monumentally poor management.  I am tired at the pointing of the finger at nurses, doctors, care assistants, ambulance drivers and other while those responsible for managing the HSE get away with the nonsense that there was a systems failure.  When an old man bleeds to death, it is a systems failure.  "Systems failures" is code for management incompetence.  I could go on forever.  Each of the HSE responses to the recommendations made in the Leas Cross report is exactly the same and indicates that it is proceeding on a path but there is no hint of a sense of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The Minister of State wants to know what I would do.  First, I would confront the fundamental unstated problem, about which we all know.  The Department of Finance is resolutely committed to not accepting any major funding commitment for old people in long-term care.  It is determined to extract a pound of flesh, if not hundreds of pounds of flesh, in payments from old people if they have any assets or if their children have any income.  We are being held up by the inability to produce before a general election a politically neutral proposal on the funding of long-term care.  It is all about running away from the delightful fact that people are living longer and better lives than ever before, which is seen by the Department of Finance as a problem, not something to celebrate.  It is determined that we will not accept the responsibility for our old people that we have accepted for educating our children and in so many other areas of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">I have no idea how bodies such as the HSE and the Department of Health and Children can remain in an apparent state of catatonic relaxation and ignore what is happening.  The legislation to deal with standards did not require a huge effort or consultation with European partners or various interest groups.  Everybody working in the system, including the nursing home operators, wants this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">Clearly, if one wants to do something about standards and is waiting for 23 years, one does not need to carry out a consultation process.  The Department is full of reports, suggestions, memoranda, lobby submissions, etc., all outlining what people want.  It is a smokescreen to cover up monumental ineptitude, inexplicable and unforgivable delays, and a classical Department of Health and Children capacity to operate at a pace that would make a snail look like an Olympic runner.  The fundamental problem is that the pace at which the Department can do things is apparently that with which the rest of us, including old people, must live.  There is no shortage of resources or ideas on how to address the issue.  However, the Department, with considerably reduced responsibility, is still incapable of producing urgently anything like legislation to deal with what should be for most of us one of the most pressing areas of care in the health service.</p>

Every time Fianna Fáil is in power there seem to be systems failures.  The Senator is right in saying people lie behind such failures, a point he made recently on the Order of Business.  If so many Fianna Fáil Governments have been in power, as he says, that is democracy.  It is the people voting Fianna Fáil into power.  The systems failures happened during the term of office of successive Governments, including those in which his party participated.  It was particularly the case in respect of the Travers report on nursing home charges.  The Senator should shoulder some of the responsibility and not lay all of the blame on the parties in government.</p>

          <p eId="para_831">In light of the heavy criticism of the Government, it is time somebody informed Senator Ryan that his party was in power at one stage.  He may have forgotten that because it was a long time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">On 1 June 2005, the House heard statements on nursing homes.  Early that day, Senator Brian Hayes sought for the Order of Business to be changed in order that we might debate the matter.  This move came about in the aftermath of the appalling "Prime Time" programme on Leas Cross.  I stated at the time that we should not play politics with what emerged in that programme.  All right-thinking people were absolutely appalled by the blatant abuse that appeared on their television screens.  Examining what I said in that debate, it still makes my stomach sick to read about that which we were discussing 18 months ago, namely, patients being left in wet beds, forced to take medication and bullied, and old men and women being held down and staff cursing at them.  It is frightening to think that this happened and that it could happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children which last week was addressed by Mr. Aidan Browne, a former nurse and current national director of the HSE's primary care unit.  Mr. Browne came before the committee with a team of people and outlined what the HSE has done since the Leas Cross scandal emerged.</p>

I grew up in Tullamore, County Offaly, and my aunt died at Riada House, a State nursing home, in the town.  She received care of a level that was second to none.

          <p eId="para_839">If people are means tested, at least we then know they cannot afford to obtain entry to private nursing homes.  People are queuing up to gain entry to public nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The team from the HSE informed us that unannounced inspections are taking place.  I agree with the carrying out of such inspections, but I have a slight reservation in respect of them.  Inspection teams are made up of three people, namely, a nurse, a doctor and an environmental health officer.  In my opinion, lay people should also comprise part of the inspection teams and I would like to hear the Minister of State's views in that regard.  Lay people often notice things professionals may not notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Unannounced inspections are being carried out day and night.  If an inspection team interviews an elderly patient, he or she may have very good reasons for not talking.  For example, he or she may be afraid do so for fear of being seen as complaining.  In addition, that person might fear subsequent reprisals.  If a member of such an individual's family could be present, he or she could speak on his or her relative's behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">A total of 666 inspections were carried out in the period from January to October.  Private nursing homes are continually assessed and those involved in carrying out inspections were happy to state that there is no immediate risk to residents in any of these homes.  Private nursing homes are being monitored around the clock and any action deemed necessary in respect of them will be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">I asked Mr. Aidan Browne if a bad report relating to a nursing home would be published and how this would be done.  He stated that nursing homes which receive such reports are obliged to publish them in their reception areas.  I pulled him up on this because I am of the opinion that the word "obliged" is not strong enough.  If one is obliged to do something, it means one is not really being asked to do something and that it is up to oneself to do it.  There is an obligation but one may not take action.  I informed Mr. Aidan Browne that these bad reports should be posted on the Internet or sent to people who are considering placing their loved ones in such homes or to the families of people who are already resident in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">I was interested to discover that the HSE forwarded a copy of Professor O'Neill's report to the Garda Síochána, An Bord Altranais and the Medical Council.  As a former member of the two regulatory bodies, I asked if a formal complaint had been made.  I was informed that formal complaints have been made to the Medical Council and to An Bord Altranais.  That is quite a serious development.  There must be suspicions that certain individuals have questions to answer or that they may have been guilty of professional misconduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">In fairness to them, the members of the team that appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children admitted that some nursing homes cut corners.  Those who run certain homes are extremely conscious of profit margins.  However, it is important to note that many nursing home proprietors provide high-quality care and their facilities operate to high standards.  Many nursing homes with which I am familiar are vocationally driven to deliver quality care and go out of their way to ensure elderly patients are well looked after.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Out of the 436 private nursing homes in operation — it is only to such homes that we are referring in this debate — questions arise in respect of between eight and 12.  It is a small number but it is eight or 12 to many.  We must adopt a balanced approach.  Older people listen to the kind of scaremongering in which individuals engage to score political points and those politicians who engage in such scaremongering do not realise how frightening their words are for the elderly.  If I were an old person considering entering a nursing home, I would be terrified by the way Opposition politicians shout——</p>

          <p eId="para_857">One of the matters that saddens me about debates of this nature relates to the issue raised by Senator Feeney regarding the scoring of political points.  The Senator is absolutely correct that matters of this sort should not be used to score such points.  The difficulty is, however, that if she happens to be on this side of the House next year, she will be doing the same thing.  I have been a Member of the House long enough to realise that fact, so what she said does not cut any ice with me.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_864">These guys are too smart.  Many Members were concerned about how the issue of the legal advice would be dealt addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Patients are happy and content in most nursing homes.  Recently, I visited a number of nursing homes for a number of reasons.  I received a great lift when I sat beside a 90 year old woman from west Clare in the reception area of a nursing home in the midlands.  I asked her how she had come to be in the nursing home.  She replied that she had no family in Ireland, as her siblings were abroad, and she wanted to stay in a home where she would be looked after.  I asked her why she selected the particular nursing home and she replied that she read about it in <i>Woman’s Way</i> and it sounded like the kind of place she would like.  She was absolutely <i>compos mentis</i> and she was looked after very well.  I had called to this home to visit a person who had a high profile in the media until recently but, unfortunately, he is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.  He did not recognise me but we had known each other very well over the years.  He was well cared for and when I walked into the home, staff were hovering around to help him.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">An increasing number of families have relations who need to be cared for in a nursing home because of their age and the family's need for space.  Home supports are provided by the Department but I know three or four families that must look after, say, two spinster aunts who live independently but who can no longer look after themselves.  The State provides each of them with supports but if they lived together and received the same support, it would take pressure off nursing homes.  That is not rocket science.  An average person examining systems, efficiencies and value for money would consider this and it should be examined in the budget.  Groups of elderly people could be cared for together using the home help service and independent care groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Many care support groups and agencies are not subject to inspection or examination and staff employed by them are not subject to legal or security checks.  I could outline two worrying cases of individuals who should not have been left on their own in the homes of elderly people.  Even though the agency involved was reputable, it had not conducted a check because it was not required to do so.  Staff employed by such agencies to provide home support should be registered centrally.  For example, security clearances must be provided by those brought into schools as substitute teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The inspectorate is a bad idea, although inspection is a good idea.  It is not possible to establish an inspectorate qualified to deal with all the issues raised in the report.  Nursing homes should be included in the remit of the local health and safety officer and he or she should be required to forward reports once or twice a year.  Similarly, reports should be provided by the local fire officer and general practitioner clinic while a structure should be provided so that families and friends of nursing home patients can have an input into the inspection process.  I have heard the arguments about on-the-spot inspections and unexpected inspections during the night and so on.  However, no single office can inspect fire hazards as well as all other health and safety issues, the staff-patient ratio and the use of medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">I would need reassurances that my loved ones are not being drugged up to their eyes, because that is the most important issue.  I could live with the temperature being too high or low in the home or a few minor hiccups in the service provided, even though that should not happen.  However, the greatest issue is the administration of drugs to those living in the nursing home and that cannot be covered by the inspectorate proposed by the Minister.  Everybody is clamouring for it and the political commitment has been made but it is like a soundbite to get people off the Government's back and it is not a good idea.  A multifaceted approach must be adopted so that all the issues involved are examined and the appropriate agent is given responsibility for them such as the local doctor, fire officer, health and safety officer, dietician or other medical staff.  Medication checks should be conducted and I would be reassured by that.  The family and friends of patients should also have a structured input.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The publication of the report in the main hall or reception was a little freaky.  While I can understand the argument for doing so, I do not know what that can tell us.  It should have been made available to all those who were looking after patients in the home.  I did not understand recently why, when four or five nursing homes were suspended, they could continue to operate even though they were not permitted to take in more patients.  If they could not take in patients, the issue was probably the staff-patient ratio, but that was not stated.  I would like to know if that was the case because it would concern me less than a problem of a more fundamental nature, that is, the care of the residents.  I do not know whether publishing these reports will provide the information for which we are looking.  This is a matter of trust and confidence and giving people information to make judgment calls in the knowledge that so-called official Ireland has examined the situation and reached certain conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">In other major scandals, such as at Artane and Letterfrack, part of the problem was due to the wrong inspection routine.  Inspectors went in and got tea and buns in the parlours, but that did no good.  A modern version of the same could occur in this instance if it were always the same inspector visiting.  Let us spread the job of inspection to the qualified people, namely, a health inspector, a dietician, a local general practitioner, a fire officer, a health and safety official and, every now and then, someone with a qualification in geriatrics.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">There will always be problems.  This is not a political issue and we must deal with it in a straightforward and efficient way that provides value for money, restores trust and confidence in the system and looks after our future because all of us will be involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_874">The Minister of State is taking the butt of the abuse, but it is important that he does not take the blame for this issue.  I am sorry for him because he is doing his best with a hot issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">In my document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism, a copy of which everyone has received, I designated abuse of the elderly under the heading of crime against older people.  It states: "The National Council on Ageing and Older People report that between 12,000 and 20,000 older people may be suffering from some form of abuse at any given time."  These figures are frightening.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Abuse of the elderly is a serious issue that was not revealed until the Leas Cross incident.  My document states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_877">Elder abuse is a serious issue in Ireland that has not received the same priority as in other countries.  The Elder Abuse Response Helpline, set up to help victims of abuse in the UK, received so many calls from Ireland that it now provides a special number — 1800 940 010 — for callers from Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">In October, I attended a conference in Croke Park at which Dr. Maurice Manning, the president of the Irish Human Rights Commission, was the guest speaker.  He stated: "Some of the worst abuses of human rights in Ireland can be found in the treatment of older people in long-stay care."  Regarding Dr. Manning's speech, the document Ageing Matters in Ireland states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_879">Older people were identified by the commission when it was established in 2001 as one of the most vulnerable groups in Irish society, he told the conference on the rights and entitlements of older people at Croke Park on 2 October.  As a result, the very first piece of research commissioned by the commission was a study of older people in long-stay care, carried out by barrister Ita Mangan.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">I am sure that the Minister of State is familiar with the study.  Dr. Manning was further quoted as stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_881">It was a fine and frightening piece of work which made most of the points which were subsequently effectively and dramatically made in the "Prime Time" programme on Leas Cross.  For us, Ita Mangan's report revealed a series of serious human rights breaches.  We published the report.  Not surprisingly, there was little media reaction and the response from the Department of Health was, I'm sorry to say, perfunctory and dismissive.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">He also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_883">It gave us no pleasure when the Leas Cross programme dominated public interest to point out that we had warned the Department and the public much earlier of the defects in current practice and of what needed to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">The issue always existed, but we did not know about it until it was revealed on "Prime Time".  We could not believe how people were being treated.  Regarding systems failure, I do not know how human beings could behave like savages by treating older people in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Senator Browne stated that a comparative study of the private and public residential homes has not been conducted, but a report on the matter was published several months ago.  The report, with which the Minister of State's official is probably familiar, referred to better care in public nursing homes.  The profit motive has gone wild in private residential homes with the result that everyone is afraid.  Senator O'Toole stated that he would not like to see his parents in such a home, but I would not like even to see myself in one.  I would shoot myself now.</p>

          <p eId="para_889">A significant job must be done.  Senator O'Toole referred to the inspectorate, but the matter is not simple.  I reflected on what he said.  I worked in the public sector of the building industry.  Inspections were carried out, but people became so sociable with the other side that they closed their eyes, as it were.  A distance must be kept between the inspectors and the owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The Minister of State's speech was excellent, especially his last paragraph, but it was ridiculous of Senator Browne to attack him.  On behalf of the Department, the Minister of State said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_891">Everything must be done to avoid a situation such as arose in Leas Cross ever arising again.  This Government is committed to developing appropriate structures to ensure that our older citizens receive the best possible care in the most appropriate settings, in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in his important portfolio.  The issues outlined in my documents, including A New Approach to Child Care, are close to my heart as a Senator.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_893">I welcome the Minister of State.  When one leaves a mother, father or someone in a nursing home, the least one expects is that they will be cared for in a professional and caring fashion.  What happened in Leas Cross was despicable.  People were responsible for the grievous wrongs and practices visited on the old, infirm and vulnerable people in the nursing home.  People were charged with supervising the staff working in the home.  People in the health authority knew and should have acted to ensure safety and that care and proper attention was given to the patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The Government has had a deplorable Pontius Pilate attitude towards accountability.  Initially, the atrocities were brought to the attention of the Government by Deputy O'Dowd, the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, and a wonderful "Prime Time" programme that shocked the nation and eventually stirred the bureaucratic system into action.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I will return to what Senator O'Dowd, as he then was, said in 2001.  For the Government to say it knew nothing of what was taking place does not wash.  In a motion before this House in July 2001 Senator O'Dowd called for an independent inspectorate for nursing homes, both private and public, an approved quality training programme for care assistants and the creation of an office of the ombudsman for the elderly.  The reply from the Minister of State at the time was to the effect that there was concern about nursing home legislation and monitoring standards in private nursing homes but that he and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, would rectify the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">That is what the Government promised in 2001.  It was fully aware of what was happening because it was brought to its attention.  It should not have taken a "Prime Time" investigation to force the Government into action in calling for a report into Leas Cross and investigating other nursing homes.  There was a systems failure, which seems to be the catchphrase for all the ills for which the Government is not prepared to accept responsibility.  However, people were responsible for what happened in that nursing home.  The health board, the Department of Health and Children and the Government knew.  Will they be held accountable or will it be brushed under the carpet as so many other things have been?</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The families of the patients who were in Leas Cross are correct to band together and demand action.  It is the least they deserve after witnessing what happened to their loved ones.  This was just one nursing home but many more since have been found to be lacking in basic hygiene, basic staffing levels and other things.  I would not wish to tar every nursing home, private or public, with the same brush because the majority are good and care properly for people.  However, others need attention and inspection, which were called for in 2001.  My colleague, Senator Browne, referred earlier to the large number of inspectors in the agricultural sector to examine farms compared to the numbers inspecting nursing homes.  There is one inspector for every 11 farmers but one for every 370 patients in nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">We must put in a properly-staffed inspectorate.  Taking on board what Senator O'Toole said, we must put in place the right people from the various disciplines, such as nursing, health and safety and others, who will go into homes unannounced on a regular basis and report on the work being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">I commend Senator White on her document.  I only glanced at it today but believe she is making a genuine attempt to highlight the problem.  Most elderly people want to stay and receive care in their homes for as long as is humanly possible.  That should be our aim, as has been stated in all Government policies since 1999 and long before in various health reports.  We are not putting sufficient effort into home care packages to assist people who live at home and want to stay there.  We are not giving sufficient support to the carers in our society, who are unsung heroes.  These people deserve far greater support than they have received.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">We should also consider sheltered housing for the elderly.  Many are ambulant and can get around but are fearful for their safety in their own homes, as are their families.  There should be more sheltered housing with facilities providing all the supports the elderly need.  We should support facilities such as that in Mulranny and other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">This report is damning of our society and of the inaction of all the people involved in this debacle.  Let us hope the Government acts this time because in 2001 it was fully informed of the situation.  A full and frank debate took place in this House and commitments were given which were not honoured.  If commitments at that time had been honoured we would probably not have had a Leas Cross or the other problems with nursing homes that have been mentioned.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_902">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I welcome the fact it is taking place because it helps bring further into the open the dreadful difficulties at Leas Cross.  It must cause us to reflect on the possibility that Leas Cross was not alone in the difficulties it faced and it puts a strong moral obligation on the Government not just to investigate individual cases but to ensure a full and positive response.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">An inspectorate is vital.  We must ensure all institutions which care for the elderly, be they private residential homes or public district hospitals, offer the highest standards of accommodation possible.  The people who reside at such places must be given all the attention they require and an inspectorate must ensure that happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">I support the concluding comments of Senator Cummins on assisting the elderly to remain in their homes for as long as possible, which should be central to any debate we hold on the elderly.  I also welcome the work done by Senator White in publishing her proposals.  It is interesting that the Senator has brought forward two policy papers, one dealing with child care, the other with care of the elderly.  We have debated child care much in the past couple of years and some progress has been made, though there is a long way to go.  We have not, however, matched that debate at the other end of the spectrum with an equivalent one on care for the elderly and the ageing process, and how to plan ahead in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">It depresses me that the only solution we seem able to find is nursing homes.  If as a society the extent of our ambition for the elderly is that they have a perfectly clean and comfortable bed in a clean and comfortable nursing home or district hospital, fully regulated and open to inspection with all medical support available, we have many questions to answer.  We must revert to attempting to ensure the maximum number of citizens can remain with their families and in their communities.  That should be our ambition for the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">Consider the demographics of the country.  The population is ageing; people can now aspire to living longer than was the case heretofore.  While this gives rise to certain difficulties, it also creates opportunities.  It is a question of what our political and social ambitions for the elderly are.  Whether it is Leas Cross, another private nursing home or a district hospital in which people reside when no other option is available, we must ensure the accommodation is of the highest standard.  However, it is only a partial answer to what we as a society and particularly as Members of the Oireachtas owe to the elderly, the people who built this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">A great deal could be done.  I hope in the budget next week there will be further progress on ways to ensure people can remain with their family and friends in their community.  The carer's allowance scheme is one which, if amended slightly and at modest cost, could help many more to remain in their homes.  We have debated this issue previously with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.  From the figures he provided in the course of the debate on social welfare matters last year it appears that the cost of removing the means test and providing the maximum carer's allowance for those providing full-time care and attention for those in need of it would be modest in the context of overall social welfare provision.  I hope there will be progress in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">Senator Cummins mentioned sheltered care residential units, about which a great deal more could be done.  There are tax breaks and investment allowances on construction of all types, from holiday homes to car parks to student accommodation.  It would be valid to bring forward tax relief proposals for the construction of residential care units for the elderly in towns and villages where people could live independently but with a certain level of care available.  More money should be provided for grant schemes such as the disabled person's grant scheme.  Planning policy should be examined in order that where people are seeking to build a granny flat or a suitable alternative unit of accommodation near their family home for an elderly relative, it would be considered a welcome development rather than a planning difficulty.  These suggestions should be considered seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">Having perfect nursing homes and district hospitals, while that is necessary and should be an aspiration, is far from the complete answer to what society should attempt to provide for the elderly.  It is a challenge.  The demographics of our society have changed to the extent that the magazine <i>Ageing Matters</i> states that by 2050 Irish people older than 65 years will outnumber those under 16.  That statistic brings opportunities and challenges but it also shows the scale of the task we face.  It must confirm the fact that the nursing home solution, as a stand-alone solution to care of the elderly, is well off target.  The political challenge is to seek to support every effort that will allow people to remain in their community, whether that is by way of grant aid, tax initiatives or support through the various social welfare schemes.  That is best for the elderly and their families and, in the long run, society.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Nursing homes, be they private nursing homes or public district hospitals, will continue to play a role in care of the elderly.  We must ensure the highest standard of care and accommodation is provided.  The Leas Cross report is a wake up call.  There is also the issue of profiting from investment in nursing homes.  We read about consortia and various groups reflecting on the possibility of buying chains of nursing homes in Britain or Ireland and reports in which the elderly are described as a growing market, as if they were an economic prospect for financial gain.  That is worrying.  If that is how we see the issue, this has become a very cold society.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">The challenge starts in the budget next week and the measures the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs put in place to provide for the elderly.  As we have a booming economy, sufficient resources must be provided to care for them.  They are more than the grey vote; they are not simply units of the electorate or the economy.  They are the people who built this country and deserve a great deal more than they have received from Governments during the years.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_366">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_912">I welcome the opportunity to respond to the issues raised in this debate.  I thank Senators for their contributions.  Many important issues were raised, with Senators viewing the issue from the background of their own experience and some from the perspective of the careers they had before becoming Members of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">Senator O'Toole spoke about the publication of the report and the difficulty that arose about the legal concerns expressed by the HSE at the time.  He did not consider these to be real concerns.  As the HSE had commissioned the report, it was its property.  It raised this difficulty at an early stage.  The problem was that people were mentioned in the report, probably in a critical fashion, and not given an opportunity to respond.  That was probably due to the terms of reference given to Professor Des O'Neill.  However, that is not meant as a criticism of the report.  The Minister indicated that whatever legal issues had arisen should be overcome, as we were keen to have the report published.  It is clear from the final report that the people and organisations mentioned in it, directly or indirectly, were given an opportunity to respond, as their responses are included.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">One of the comments made in the report by Professor O'Neill is that what happened in the nursing home equates to institutional elder abuse. Efforts are ongoing within my Department to deal with instances of elder abuse and to improve and develop services for older people.  Following the publication of the report, Abuse, Neglect and Mistreatment of Older People: An Exploratory Study, by the National Council on Ageing and Older People in 1998, a working group was established to advise on the formulation of procedures and guidelines on elder abuse.  The working group published its report, Protecting Our Future, in 2002 after carrying out a comprehensive work programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">While the prevalence of elder abuse in Ireland is not known, studies in other developed countries indicate that about 3% to 5% of older people living in the community may suffer abuse at any specific time, which implies that between 12,000 and 20,000 people living in the community in Ireland may be suffering from abuse.  There are no figures available on the incidence of abuse in institutions but, unfortunately, such abuse does occur.  While we are concentrating in this debate on the abuse which took place in one nursing home, the majority of abuse occurs in older people's homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">Protecting Our Future recommended that the issue of elder abuse should be placed in the wider context of health and social care services for older people.  Elder abuse is a complex and difficult issue to define precisely.  It may involve financial, physical or sexual abuse or it may arise due to inadequacy of care.  The report made recommendations on health services structures, awareness, education and training, financial abuse, advocacy, legislation and research and education, which would include the establishment of a national centre.  It also recommended that an elder abuse national implementation group should be established to guide the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the report.  Such a group was established under the chairmanship of Professor Desmond O'Neill, a consultant in the medicine of old age, in December 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">Awareness training for Health Service Executive staff has been provided in line with the report and the HSE has been involved in awareness training with volunteer staff, including the national senior citizens helpline.  The issue of elder abuse is being incorporated into professional training courses in areas such as gerontology.  In addition, a number of research projects have been undertaken, including the examination and review of medication for older persons in continuing care settings.  The Health Service Executive recently advertised for senior case workers and it is expected that 27 such workers and four dedicated elder abuse officers will be appointed by the end of the year.  Discussions are ongoing on the structure of a new research centre for elder abuse and work continues on the preparation of a tender document for the new facility.  In the period 2003 to 2005, approximately €2.5 million in additional funding was allocated to the elder abuse programme and €2 million was allocated in the 2006 budget to facilitate the implementation of the full range of recommendations in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">The cornerstone of Government policy in the care of older people is to support and maintain people in their home environment, whether that be the family home, a community residence or a residential centre, assist those who become ill or dependent to regain their independence where possible, encourage and support care in the community and provide a higher quality of hospital care when people can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.  With regard to Senator Bradford's comments on nursing homes, our aim is to provide as much care as possible at home so that nursing homes are the last option rather than the first.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I acknowledge the significant investment made by this Government in the care of older people and palliative care, as represented by the additional €110 million announced in the budget for 2006 by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The full year cost of the services outlined in this package is €150 million.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that older people will be one of his priorities in this year's budget.  While I would be first to acknowledge that services for older people were under-funded for a long time, a serious attempt was made last year to address that imbalance.  The €150 million allocated last year represents the start of a major investment programme in services for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Home care packages deliver a wide range of services and, in recent years, have been piloted successfully in several regions.  Such packages include the services of nurses, home care attendants, home helps, physiotherapists and occupational therapists.  Last year, approximately 1,100 home care packages were provided and we are in a position to provide an additional 2,000 packages this year.  The HSE has informed the Department that a total of 3,095 additional home care packages were provided up to the end of September 2006.  Not only can home care packages keep people out of hospitals and nursing homes but they can also facilitate early discharge of patients.  Patients and their families have thus far been very appreciative of the supports on offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">Home help services are an essential part of supporting older people at home, serving to delay or prevent admissions to long stay residential care.  They also help to keep people out of acute hospitals and support early discharge.  An additional €33 million full-year cost was allocated for this programme under the 2006 budget.  This funding is being used to provide 1.75 million more home help hours this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Day and respite care are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people.  The provision of €9 million in a full year allows for an additional 1,325 places per week in such centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">There is a significant increase in the resources available to meals on wheels services.  Apart from the nourishment provided through these services, they also offer social contact to people who would otherwise be very lonely.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">Senator Cummins referred to the need to provide more resources for sheltered housing projects.  One such project is the Nás na Riogh Housing Association, which is converting an old convent into units for older people and facilities for intergenerational community activities.  The building, which is located in the heart of Naas, will provide opportunities for younger and older people to mix on a daily basis.  Some older people encounter a lack of stimulation when they enter homes and go downhill very quickly as a result.  Although it will not be complete for some time to come, the Nás na Riogh Housing Association project will be a model which can be replicated throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">It is clear from the 2006 budget package that the Government is firmly committed to developing services for older people.  The emphasis on developing home care packages and the increases in the home help and meals on wheels schemes and other community-based supports are assisting older people to remain in their own homes and communities for longer, in accordance with their wishes.  In addition, extra funding has been provided to the nursing home subvention scheme to support the increasing numbers of people who are entitled to subvention and to reduce waiting lists for enhanced subvention.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006, which addresses the issue of subvention schemes, is being debated in the Dáil.  While I would be the first to admit that inadequacies exist in that area, the Government is actively considering funding for long-term care to address the challenges faced by older people and their families.  Tough decisions will have to be taken but we will not avoid them.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">It is right that we should devote substantial additional resources to services for older people.  Older people have made a great contribution to our society and to our present economic and social success.  Through our investments, we are saying that younger generations value the contributions made by older people and respect their needs and continuing role in society.</p>

            <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
            <p eId="para_932">I have tabled this important matter on the Adjournment to seek clarification of the current status of co-operation between Belfast and Donegal regarding facilitation of cancer patients.  I ask not as a matter of concern but for clarification, since the relationship is evolving.  I acknowledge the good work that has been done to date and the negotiating team that has set up the facility in Belfast to give people in Donegal the choice between there and Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">I also seek clarification of the arrangements regarding the different levels of cancer treatment and who is being facilitated.  Are all patients being given the choice, or is there a select group?  As I stated, co-operation between Belfast and Donegal is evolving, but ultimately we must keep the Donegal public well informed.  I have anecdotal evidence which suggests that a patient in Donegal was not being facilitated in Belfast within the past few days, and that is what caused me sufficient alarm to table this matter.  However, it may have been the case that the proper mechanics had not been set up between Belfast and Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">In a general sense, I initially welcomed this co-operation, as I would any in an all-Ulster context.  However, it is most important that the people of Donegal and the north west be assured that this will not be a long-term solution.  Galway and Belfast are still peripheral to the north-west region, and it is politically very important that the pressure be maintained to ensure a satellite radiation facility is established in the north west in the medium to long term.  There is still significant demand among the people of the region for their own local services.  A critical point in that regard is that we do not want services to be provided willy-nilly all over the place for their own sake.  However, the people of the north west want a fair share of the pie and a transformation from the present situation whereby patients must spend hours travelling long distances to access basic essential services.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">With respect to the more local dimension to medical services in the north west, in the past few days there has been an extremely serious blockage regarding general services at Letterkenny General Hospital.  I ask that the Minister of State use his influence to expedite construction of the new wing and admissions unit there.  We will have new modular facilities in January, but we must keep a very sharp focus on the short to medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and am seeking, first, clarification regarding the systems that will be employed and who will be allowed to use facilities in Belfast.  Second, it is important to recall that the Minister stated in this House that Donegal patients will be facilitated in Belfast only after priority patients from the North have been cared for.  That means that it is not a first-class, transparent system for the people of the north west.  While we welcome it and congratulate those involved in fast-tracking it as part of the negotiating team, one must remember that there is not equal access for the people of Donegal.  It is not an all-Ulster initiative or a primary accessible treatment facility for the people of Donegal.  The only way to get around this problem is by the setting up of a standalone radiation treatment centre for the north west in the long term.  We must keep a sharp focus on that objective.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_937">I thank Senator McHugh for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I hope that I will be able to provide the clarification that he sought.  If further information is required, I will do my best to get it for him.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">Acute hospital services for Donegal are provided at the general hospitals in Letterkenny and Sligo.  Donegal residents who were referred for radiotherapy services previously had to travel to Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">In July 2005, the Government decided that the best option for improving geographic access to radiation oncology services for patients in the north west was to facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital, BCH, in the short term.  Last autumn, the Minister agreed with the then Minister for Health in Northern Ireland, Mr. Sean Woodward MP, that the radiation oncology centre at BCH would provide treatment to patients from Donegal.  A project board was established under the aegis of Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, to deliver on the ministerial commitment.  It includes representatives from BCH, Altnagelvin hospital, Letterkenny hospital, the Health Service Executive and the two Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">I am pleased to inform the House that a service level agreement has been reached for the referral of about 50 radiation oncology patients annually from Donegal to BCH.  It has also been agreed that the number will be increased if there is sufficient demand from patients in Donegal.  Patient pathways have been developed, and the Health Service Executive and BCH have agreed the basis for costing the service provided by BCH.  Three assessment clinics will be held each month on an ongoing basis.  The first referral clinic took place on 8 November and patients are being referred for treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">Under the agreement, patients who are considered by the consultant radiation oncologist at Letterkenny General Hospital to require radiotherapy will be offered the choice of being referred to BCH.  I am advised that patients in south Donegal receive oncology services at Sligo General Hospital.  Those patients will be referred as appropriate for radiation oncology services to University College Hospital, Galway, and St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">The service for patients accepted for radiotherapy by BCH will be delivered in accordance with the standards set out in agreed clinical and social care governance guidelines.  Patients have the option of choosing the location that suits them best regarding travel time, transport arrangements and other personal or family circumstances.  The HSE is also committed to supporting the travel needs of patients in Donegal referred to BCH.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">This agreement reflects the significant commitment by the Government to developing North-South co-operation in health.  On behalf of the Minister, I acknowledge the work of the hospitals, the CAWT and the respective Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland.  There is considerable political, departmental and service commitment to delivering on the agreement.  It is important, therefore, that the initiative succeeds, as it will support further co-operation in health care, including cancer care.</p>

            <p eId="para_945">It is extremely important that we remain focused on the demands of the people in the north west, and not only those in Donegal.  I speak of others straddling the Border, from Tyrone down to Fermanagh and back up to Derry.  There is an urgent demand to ensure a north-west satellite radiation treatment centre.  I acknowledge that this is a move forward and accept that there has been very positive co-operation between North and South.  I also acknowledge that this is more than simply a relationship between the two Departments but something symbolically significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">The point I wish to make is simple.  Prior to the 2002 general election, a commitment was made, in writing, that a north-west satellite radiation treatment system would be put in place.  I have been asking for such a service for almost four years but have yet to see any evidence that this commitment will be fulfilled.</p>

I appreciate his interest in and knowledge of this issue.  While we welcome the ongoing co-operation between people in the North and South, it is rather more difficult to achieve the same level of co-operation between politicians.  Such co-operation is in its infancy.  While we are appreciative of the support and co-operation we have received from Belfast City Hospital, we see such co-operative measures as a short-term expedient.  Other solutions are being sought and will be found.</p>

          <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_377">
            <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
            <p eId="para_950">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power.  I am interested in his views on competition in the health insurance market and, in particular, on the proposed introduction of risk equalisation.  If the latter is implemented as proposed, it may well result in the health insurance market returning to a state of total monopoly by one provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">The Irish health insurance market is unique among European and international models in its domination by one major player.  VHI has a near monopoly on the market and had it entirely to itself for almost half a century.  BUPA, a relatively new company, and VIVAS, an even newer one, have a limited share of the market between them but may now be obliged to operate according to the constraints of risk equalisation.  A decision in the courts last week means that the Government is entitled from a legislative prospective to introduce risk equalisation.  Interestingly, the judgment in this case included an observation that risk equalisation, if implemented as currently proposed, could make BUPA's position in the market commercially non-viable.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">Given that the State encourages people to avail of private health care insurance, it has an obligation to ensure there is maximum competition in the market.  Whether in respect of air or bus transport or any other form of economic activity, the one lesson we have learned beyond doubt in the last 20 years is that competition works and that a deficiency in this regard has negative consequences for consumers.  It must be a keystone of health insurance policy to ensure that competition remains in the market.  Not only must BUPA and VIVAS be facilitated to remain in the market but other players must be encouraged to offer health services to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">There is a convincing body of evidence to support my contention that the concept of risk equalisation, as threatened to be enacted by the Government, will result in the collapse not only of one particular company but of competition in general in the health insurance market.  What will the Minister for State do to ensure competition is protected?  What will be done to cushion the blow from the introduction of risk equalisation and the subsequent driving out of competition in the market?</p>
            <p eId="para_954">I understand a meeting took place last night between the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and representatives of BUPA, but I am not aware what transpired.  Media reports at the weekend suggested the Minister is considering the introduction of several measures to deal with the greatly unbalanced situation of VHI's strength in the market.  There were even suggestions that VHI might be broken down into several companies.  These and other issues must be addressed in the interests of protecting competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">There was an unwillingness on the part of some in the body politic to accept that risk equalisation might drive out BUPA and other health insurance providers.  It has dawned on many in recent days, however, particularly in view of last week's court judgment, that risk equalisation, if introduced as proposed, will do just that.  BUPA, a mutual society rather than a profit-making company, will be driven out of the market, and other companies will be discouraged from entering it.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">Rather than facilitating a monopoly situation, we must ensure there is competition.  Risk equalisation, however, is the greatest threat to competition.  Its introduction in the context of the already distorted health insurance market in this State must be urgently reviewed and reversed.  I look forward to the engagement of the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Harney, on this issue in the next crucial weeks.  I await the Minister of State's response with interest.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_378" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_957">I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  Private voluntary health insurance is an integral part of the Irish health care system, a service of which more than half the population avails.  It has, for almost 50 years, played a major role in the financing of our health services and in offering choice to the public.  There is widespread support for Government policy establishing community rating as a fundamental principle of the health insurance market.  This principle, together with lifetime cover and open enrolment, guarantees affordability of private health insurance for many people and an equitable non-discriminatory regulatory framework for health insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">The Government continues to support sustainable competition and consumer choice in the private health insurance market.  Alongside this, the Government will also support the stability of the community rated health insurance system and the safeguards provided to protect it, such as risk equalisation.  This policy is designed with the express purpose of benefiting the insured population, particularly the elderly and the ill, who would otherwise be vulnerable to the effects of risk selection, and would find the cost of private health insurance unaffordable.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">Risk equalisation seeks to remove an insurer's incentive to select preferred risks.  It is clear from international health insurance markets that a system of risk equalisation and community rating is not incompatible with viable, ongoing competition.  However, a market without the balancing measure of risk equalisation to address the effect of mandatory community rating exposes insurers with higher-risk members to spiralling claims and potential financial distress.  Risk equalisation is not designed to over-compensate any insurance undertaking for the share of the total community of sick and elderly.  It is about compensating for differential risk profiles rather than transferring profits.  Its objective is to ensure that competition takes place on an equitable basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">In December 2005, the Minister asked the Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority to examine the health insurance market and to bring forward recommendations on how greater competition might be encouraged.  Their joint report is expected early in 2007.  The Government is mindful of ensuring competition to allow consumers the choice to which they are entitled.  It is the Government's view that the regulatory framework for private health insurance, including the provision for risk equalisation, is appropriate.  This position has been endorsed by the High Court in a comprehensive judgment delivered last week.  The written judgment is not yet available and will need to be carefully analysed by all concerned.  While the Government accepts that the framework influences the market environment, it does so for a good reason, namely, the protection of the consumer and in the interests of the common good.</p>

          <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_379">
            <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
            <p eId="para_961">Following the publication several weeks ago of a Comhairle na nOspidéal report on neurosurgical services, it became clear there was to be the continuation of only two units in the country.  Galway was not to have a unit.  The report claimed the provision of a third unit would impinge on the viability of the other two.  However, the report makes the best case possible in support of the provision of a unit in University College Hospital, Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">This time last year the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, visited University College Hospital, Galway.  She indicated that neurosurgical services should be established in Galway as part of the Government's health strategy.  She claimed such a service was required if there was to be regional autonomy.  Certain accident cases requiring specialist neurosurgical treatment could not be transferred to Dublin for distance reasons.  The case for the service in the west was made to her in an impressive presentation before Christmas last year.  It is ironic that the position has changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">Neurosurgeons at Beaumont Hospital have said that a State-run emergency air ambulance service would be preferable to establishing a neurosurgical unit on the western seaboard.  They acknowledged there could be an argument for a unit for emergencies and spinal injuries.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">Six reasons were given in the report why a neurosurgery unit should not be located in Galway.  These are in fact the best reasons there should be.  The Comhairle na nOspidéal report team comprised four medical people and two lay people.  The report stated there was an "insufficient catchment population to maintain the skills of staff in a Galway unit".  It stated 750,000 was the population figure needed for a viable unit.  Despite this, the report's appendix B stated such a unit in Galway would cover the old western health board area of Galway, Roscommon and Mayo together with north-west Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Clare, parts of Limerick, north Tipperary, Offaly and Westmeath.  This catchment area, as the appendix stated, comprises 1.025 million people.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">The report's authors visited Australia, New Zealand, Scotland and England to examine units there.  Many of the units they visited catered for populations of fewer than 1 million people.  The report stated that no small units had been opened in these countries, yet on 15 June 2006, a unit was opened in Waikato in New Zealand with a population catchment of fewer than 800,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">They visited Aberdeen in Scotland with a population catchment of 500,000, the nearest to Galway.  The report stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_967">Aberdeen Royal Infirmary is the largest hospital in the Grampian region. It has in excess of 1,000 beds and provides a complete range of medical and clinical specialties, with the exception of heart and liver transplantation.  The neurosurgical unit, with a population catchment of 500,000, is staffed by 3 consultant neurosurgeons, 4 consultant neurologists, 1 full-time consultant neuroradiology, 1 consultant neuropathologist and 2 consultant neuroanaesthetists.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">The report continued:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_969">Management and consultant representatives in Aberdeen stated their belief that the neurosurgery unit in Aberdeen is viable and necessary, particularly to ensure rapid access to services.  It was stated that there is a need to increase the consultant staffing to 4 consultant neurosurgeons.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">The Fine Gael Party leader, Deputy Kenny, in the Dáil today highlighted the crisis in neurosurgery.  No one in the west is asking that they receive a service at the expense of Dublin or Cork.  No new appointment has been made in Beaumont Hospital.  The technical equipment in the hospital is breaking down.  Two eminent consultants, including Ciaran Bolger, have stated that people's lives are in danger.  The first conclusion of the report is fallacious and those professionals who put their names to it should not be allowed to go unquestioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">The second conclusion stated there was insufficient catchment population to maintain the skills of staff in two regional units.  One consultant in Cork has stated if the catchment area in Cork were encroached upon by the provision of an additional unit in Galway, there would be problems for the Cork unit.  Unashamedly, he was stating the preservation of his patch and the turf war between Dublin and Cork is more important than the health and safety of people in the west.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">The report also concluded that the establishment of a third unit would be likely to inhibit the development of a tertiary neuroscience centre.  The Minister for Health and Children would not have made the statement she did on her visit to Galway last Christmas if that was the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">The most damning conclusion of all concerned the changing trends in demands for neurosurgical services.  The report claimed that with new medicines and medical procedures, fewer people are in need of neurosurgical services.  However, statistics show there has been a 3% increase per annum in the demand for such services.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, once and for all to support this request as she did 12 months ago.  This report is an opinion.  It is not policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">Nobody in Galway is trying to hinder the development of those services in Cork or Dublin.  A neurosurgeon in the United States has made an offer, with no strings attached, and €1 million additional funding is available from the widow of a former professor, Pat Dwyer.  The equivalent of €5 million is available, with no strings attached, to provide this service.  Why is Galway the second tier of all the services in the west?  I do not think the Minister for Health and Children would allow that label to be used in this instance.</p>

            <from>Mr. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_975">I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising this issue this evening.  I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">I welcome this opportunity to inform the Seanad of the position with regard to the development of neurosurgical services.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, recently published a review of neurosurgical services in Ireland which was prepared by the former Comhairle na nOspidéal.  It focuses, in particular, on the provision of adequate capacity and consideration of equity of access to neurosurgical services.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">Neurosurgery is provided at the national centre in Beaumont Hospital and in Cork University Hospital.  In summary the report recommends that the future development of safe, high quality neurosurgical services in Ireland would be best served by a two-pronged approach involving increased capacity in Dublin and Cork, and improved access to neurosurgical units, including transport and telemedicine facilities for referring hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The report identifies a clear need for significant investment in neurosurgical services.  It states that the development of services must be contingent on organisational reform.  This includes the need to put in place clear clinical leadership to guarantee service quality; to ensure appropriate linkages between neurosurgical units and crucially to develop clinical pathways with referring hospitals which do not have on-site neurosurgical services.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">The HSE is committed to progressing the recommendations of the report to ensure the development of neurosurgical services in Ireland is in line with international best practice.  A national neurosciences needs assessment is under way.  Neuroscience includes neurology, neurophysiology and neurosurgery.  This assessment is guided by previous Comhairle reports on neurology and neurophysiology and the recent report on neurosurgery.  It aims to identify the requirements for neuroscience services as a whole across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">I understand an interim progress report is due to be submitted to the National Hospitals Office shortly and the final report will be submitted in February next year.  The HSE is pursuing the development of additional neurology services in Waterford, Limerick and Sligo.  This will facilitate the management of patients who live outside Dublin who may need neurosurgical opinions or interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">The Government provided an additional €3 million in 2006 to develop neuroscience services and the recently published Estimates for the Health Service Executive provide a further €4 million to continue these developments into 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">Comhairle na nOspidéal considered the case for a neurosurgical unit in Galway at length.  Representatives of the Western Neurosurgery Campaign met the Comhairle committee to put their case for neurosurgical services to be located in the west.  Comhairle's conclusion was that a unit in Galway would not be viable.  It also considered that the needs of the entire population would be ill-served by the division of neurosurgical expertise and resources between three neurosurgical units.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">The reasons for this decision include insufficient catchment population in the west; changing trends in demand for neurosurgical services; international experience on the viability of small neurosurgical units; significant scope for improving services by increasing capacity in existing units as well as providing improved transport and telemedicine facilities.  Comhairle's conclusion is that the needs of neurosurgical patients would be better served by increased capacity in the existing units and the development of systems that promote rapid assessment, diagnosis of injury and transfer, than by the development of a third unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">The report acknowledges that this decision will be a disappointment to many who have campaigned for the establishment of a neurosurgical unit in the west.  The HSE is convinced, however, that the implementation of the recommendations of the report represent the best way forward in building a high quality neurosurgical service that will meet the needs of the entire population.</p>

            <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
            <p eId="para_985">With regard to transport, the helipad and telemedicine, it will take €11.5 million in capital costs to provide helicopter transport and €4.1 million running costs per annum, making a total of more than €15 million.  That sum would resource a three consultant unit in Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">The HSE is part of a situation in which the west does not count.  The composition of that committee was biased in the first instance and that is why the situation is as described in the report the Minister of State has cited on behalf of the HSE.  I urge the Minister of State to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children, who visited the location and saw the need there.</p>
