          <p eId="para_3">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate, preferably in the presence of the Tánaiste, the following urgent matter: the link between cutbacks in community employment and JI schemes and increasing anti-social behaviour, drug abuse and related crime in areas such as south-west Clondalkin, north Clondalkin and nationwide, which contributes to social breakdown and costs the State more money in the long term.</p>

A large amount of time was given to its discussion on Committee Stage and the Houses enacted it. The legislation has been sought for a long number of years. It represents a radical step in the running of the Oireachtas. The dead hand of the Department of Finance is being removed and a commission of Members will decide how resources will be allocated.

It is a cosmetic measure to introduce a day's sitting when there is no Order of Business, no Question Time, no Adjournment and no Leaders' Questions. It is purely a device to give the appearance that the House is engaged in a normal sitting. It is not a normal sitting in a House that has been promised 22 Bills while only three have been published.</p>

All the Opposition parties have made proposals to the Government Whip but all we have got is window dressing in the form of Dáil Éireann being convened in this hollow fashion where Ministers do not have to present in the House. Opposition Deputies are expected to be satisfied with that. The people are not satisfied.</p>

          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_200">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_201">I start by expressing my appreciation to the House for facilitating the introduction of this Bill and the debate today at such short notice. I greatly appreciate the Opposition spokespersons agreeing to take the Bill. The Bill itself is short, as it comprises only five sections. It is in essence a technical instrument needed to provide legal clarity regarding an important element of the code of legislation applying to drink driving. That will facilitate effective enforcement by the Garda Síochána. It will also remove a possible basis for challenge to future prosecutions regarding certain drink driving offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The House will recall that last year the Road Traffic Act 2002 was passed. While the headline provision in that Act was the introduction of a legislative basis for the penalty points system, the Act introduced a range of other initiatives aimed at improving road safety and maximising the deterrent effects of road traffic legislation generally. One of those provisions was aimed at extending the legal basis for the taking of preliminary breath tests from drivers. That was set out in section 10 of the Act, which provided for the substitution of section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Section 10 of the 2002 Act provided for the introduction of an extension to the grounds on which a member of the Garda may require a driver to submit to a preliminary breath test. The original grounds for requiring that such a test be taken related only to circumstances where the member of the Garda was of the opinion that the driver had consumed alcohol. The new section provided that, where a driver was either involved in an accident or in the opinion of a member of the Garda Síochána had committed a traffic offence, he or she could be required to submit to a breath test. In the course of preparing to bring those new provisions into effect, my Department received legal advice that suggested that the wording regarding the taking of samples from drivers involved in accidents could be open to a very narrow interpretation which would compromise the central aim of the provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Following consideration of the legal advice, I concluded that I should not postpone the introduction of additional powers to combat drink driving pending amendment of the Road Traffic Act. Therefore, I decided to introduce the remaining elements of the new section with effect from 1 December next to coincide with the pre-Christmas anti-drink driving campaign mounted by the National Safety Council and the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">In preparing for the commencement of that provision, a separate and unforeseen legal difficulty was identified. I received legal advice which suggested that a sequencing change in the new section could cast doubt on the power of the Garda to arrest a person who had refused to submit to a preliminary breath test for the purpose of demanding that the person submit to a blood, urine or evidential breath test.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">I was presented with a dilemma. Should I abandon my stated intention to extend the scope for operation of the preliminary breath testing from 1 December next or should I request the Government to seek the agreement of the Oireachtas to address the technical difficulties that had come to notice so that we can give practical effect to the measures the Oireachtas has already approved? The Government endorsed my view that we should remedy such technical flaws at the earliest opportunity in the interests of promoting measures to combat drink driving at a time when they are likely to make the most significant impact. The Bill which I am promoting today will ensure that the Garda Síochána have the powers which the Oireachtas intended they should have to address the issue of drink driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The passing by the Oireachtas of the Road Traffic Bill 2002 and the subsequent launch of the penalty points system, initially in respect of speeding offences, has provided the catalyst for a significant reduction in road deaths over the past 12 months. While overall trends in road safety have been positive for the past number of years, primarily as a result of the pursuit of an integrated approach promoted by the Government's road safety strategy, the scale of the recent improvements has been very significant. It is probably true to suggest that in the 12 months since penalty points were introduced, some 76 fewer people have died on our roads than would otherwise have been expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">However, while the overall position in relation to road safety has improved, the position in relation to drink driving remains worryingly unacceptable. The number of detections of drink driving remains consistently high and the results of the testing systems reveal that the depth of the problem is not diminishing. The Garda made some 11,200 detections of drink driving offences in 2002. Approximately 90% of blood and urine specimens and 81% of breath specimens analysed in 2002 by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety were above the legal limit. However, what is even more worrying is that over half of those who failed blood or urine tests and almost one third of those who failed evidential breath tests had alcohol contents that were twice as high as the legal limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The number of road accidents occurring between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., the hours most commonly associated with drink driving, has been reducing in recent years, with 10.4% fewer fatal accidents occurring during these hours in 2001 than in 1997. While these reductions are welcome, we cannot definitively say that a reduction in accidents caused by drink driving has taken place. International research indicates that alcohol is a factor in up to 40% of road accidents. Estimates in Ireland suggest that alcohol is a factor in 33% of fatal accidents. There is therefore a clear case for directing this proposed enhancement of the enforcement of drink driving legislation at drivers involved in accidents. A similar argument can be made in relation to incidents where motorists breach traffic laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">My intention in announcing the introduction of the extended basis for the taking of preliminary roadside breath tests was to enhance and maximise the impact of the anti-drink driving campaign I launched last week on behalf of the National Safety Council and the Garda. The focus of the initiative was to heighten the level of the deterrent by broadening the scope for preliminary testing at least to include the circumstances where a driver had committed a traffic offence. I emphasise that my objective is to change driver behaviour by bringing home to drivers their responsibilities to themselves, their families and other road users.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">However, having realised the difficulties that could have arisen had I proceeded as planned, I determined that the best approach would be to address those difficulties but to also amend the original wording presented for the extension of preliminary testing in the 2002 Act so that I would be in a position to bring into effect a scheme which would more accurately reflect the will of the Oireachtas in passing that Act in the first instance. The immediate purpose of this Bill is to address those two key issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The key provisions can be found in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill. Section 2 provides for the substitution of section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. The section will replace section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, which sought to achieve the same objective. However, as I have already mentioned, I received advice that suggested there might be difficulties implementing this section in full. The new section presented in this Bill addresses those issues while retaining the overall focus of the provision in the 2002 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The particular difficulty with the original wording was that it was open to a view that in order for a member of the Garda to require that a driver undergo a preliminary breath test after his or her involvement in an accident, the member of the Garda would have had to witness the accident. This new section addresses that and introduces some relatively minor additional text changes from the original. The overall purpose of this section and the section it replaces, section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, provides the legislative basis for the operation of roadside preliminary breath testing of drivers by the Garda for the purpose of establishing whether or not the driver has consumed alcohol. However, as a direct result of the introduction this new section, the basis for the operation of that system will be extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Under the terms of the new section, where a member of the Garda is of the opinion that the driver of a mechanically-propelled vehicle has been involved in a collision, has committed any offence under the Road Traffic Acts or has consumed alcohol, the member may demand that the driver submit to a preliminary breath test. The original powers available to the Garda only related to the position where the member was of the opinion that a driver had consumed alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Section 3 of the Bill provides for a technical amendment to section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 so that the current reference in that section to section 12(3) will be changed to refer to section 12(4). The reason for this change is that the current section 12(3) provides the Garda with the power to arrest any driver who refuses to comply with any requirement under that section. Those requirements relate to submitting to the preliminary breath test, accompanying a garda to a place to facilitate the taking of the sample or to remaining for up to one hour with the garda so that an apparatus for the taking of the preliminary test can be provided. Where a person refuses to comply with any of those requirements, he or she is committing an offence and may be arrested and required to go to a Garda station where they will be required under section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 to submit to a blood, urine or evidential breath test.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The difficulty which has been noted in regard to the existing text of that latter section refers to the power of arrest in section 12 as being created through subsection (3). While that is the position at present, with the commencement of the new section 12, which will be facilitated by the commencement of section 2 of this Bill, the power of arrest will be provided for in subsection (4). In order to ensure that there can be no question relating to the powers of arrest and the powers to demand that a driver submits to a test under section 13, I consider that it would be appropriate to make the amendment proposed in section 3 of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Section 4 of the Bill provides for the repeal of section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, given that it is being replaced by section 2 of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I repeat that while these amendments are of a technical nature, they are important in that they will allow me to proceed immediately to provide the Garda with the powers to operate the more broadly based scheme of roadside breath testing envisaged in the 2002 Act. However, as I have indicated recently, it is my intention to move quickly to legislate for what is normally termed as full random breath testing and I hope to bring forward proposals to provide for such a scheme for the approval of the House in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I express my gratitude to Opposition spokespersons, particularly Deputies Naughten and Shortall, for agreeing at short notice to take this Bill, which is substantially of a technical nature and required for the start of the process of random testing on 1 December.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_220">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, with the purpose of which everyone in the House agrees. It is of a technical nature and will give practical effect to measures which have already been passed by the Oireachtas. The Minister refers to random breath testing but it is imperative to ensure there are protections in the Bill for members of the public. By that stage I hope we will have seen the workings of this section of the Road Traffic Act 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The reason we accepted the Minister's proposals and have facilitated him in bring them before the House is that in the past ten years, 5,000 people have been killed on Irish roads, which has cost the community more than €5 billion, not to mention the personal grief and suffering of families involved in such tragic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The National Roads Authority estimates that the purely financial cost of road accidents is €754 million per annum, or €200 for every man, woman and child. That money could be better spent on educating children, providing health care for the sick and protecting the vulnerable in society. While I am aware that this is a priority for many Members on this side of the House, it may not be as high on the list among those opposite. It is important that investment be made in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">According to the 2001 figures, a road accident occurs every 19 minutes, one person is killed on Irish roads every 21 hours and one person in a critical condition is rushed to hospital every five hours. This places major demands on the health and emergency services.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">There are a number of fundamental principles and values which guide Fine Gael's approach to this issue and that of road safety. That approach is consistent with building a safe society where the law is enforced and it aims to support families and communities and shield them from the grief and worry of road death or injury. It also focuses on the responsibility of all drivers who use our roads. Action is needed to ensure that drivers receive proper driving education, both before they take the test and throughout their lives. Safe driving must be rewarded and dangerous driving punished. It is vital that those who are responsible, drive sensibly and respect the rules of the road receive the recognition they deserve. We must ensure, however, that those who break the rules are aware they will be caught and will pay for putting others in danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The Minister brought a memorandum to Cabinet on 18 November in respect of his proposals. His public announcement the following day regarding those proposals was made with the usual fanfare. When it came to drafting the commencement order, however, problems were discovered. The Minister excels among his Cabinet colleagues at making announcements. However, he tends to talk before considering how he plans to implement a proposal. He has failed to outline the details of many of the measures he has announced and how they will be implemented. In many instances, if one contacts the Department following his announcements the officials do not have a clue as to what is going on. The Minister rarely provides a timetable in respect of proposals he makes. We could compile a large document containing the various announcements he has made in recent years, but we could list on a slip of paper those that have been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">On 19 November, the Minister stated that there is a determined effort to combat drink driving and that he would be introducing measures that would have a significant impact in terms of extending the powers available to the Garda. Before he made that announcement, did the Minister not think it might be worthwhile to draft the commencement order to ensure everything was correct? Did it not occur to him to do so? When he made his announcement on 19 November he stated that he proposes to bring forward legislation, early in 2004, to allow for the introduction of full random breath testing during next year. Will that matter be dealt with as expeditiously as the airports Bill which was supposed to be published prior to Christmas but which will not now appear until sometime next year?</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Is it possible to believe what the Minister says? I was informed last October that the road safety strategy was then being finalised. I was further informed in May that the strategy was under review and being finalised. It is over 12 months later and we still do not have a road safety strategy. We are informed, in respect of the Department's implementation of the MIAB's recommendations, that the road safety strategy has already been published and is being implemented. However, that is not the case. Road safety is a seasonal measure. Road safety, breath tests and drink driving advertisements are as much a part of the Christmas season as Santa Claus. Like Santa, they disappear when Christmas is over.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The Minister stated there is international research available which indicates that alcohol is a factor in up to 40% of road accidents and that estimates in Ireland suggest alcohol is a factor in 33% of all fatal accidents. Last week he stated that internationally it is estimated that 30% of accidents are drink-related and that this level could be as high as 40% in Ireland. Those figures do not seem to add up. Last week the level was 40%, whereas the Minister indicated earlier that it is 33%. No one can supply an accurate figure in respect of drink driving and the number of fatalities involved because the only way to do so is to have the coroner test the blood alcohol level of someone who has been involved in a fatal road traffic accident. That is at the discretion of the coroner. Figures relating to the involvement of drink driving in fatal accidents are not compiled. No one can, therefore, provide definitive figures in respect of this matter. The Minister highlighted this by referring to one figure last week and a different figure today.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The number of detections has been at a steady high. In 2002 there were 11,200 detections in respect of people driving over the limit. Some 90% of blood and urine specimens and 81% of breath specimens analysed last year showed that those who supplied them were over the blood alcohol limit. There is no doubt that a significant problem exists. However, we do not know whether the overall position is improving or disimproving. We also do not know whether the Garda enforcement campaign, the Minister's pronouncements and the National Safety Council's advertising campaigns are having any impact. If the Minister's figures are correct, money has been wasted because those campaigns have failed dismally.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The fact that a road traffic accident may have happened between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. does not necessarily mean that alcohol was involved. That is the only consolation one can draw from the statistics relating to this area. What we need is a system under which investigations into the causes of accidents will be automatically carried out. At present, the National Roads Authority has responsibility in this regard. The NRA is the agency responsible for maintaining a high standard and quality of roads and claims in its figures for 2002 that road conditions account for 2.5% of all road traffic accidents. What else would it say? It is not about to place the blame on itself or the Department of Transport for the lack of resources provided. Whoever pays the piper calls the tune.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">We do not have accurate figures in respect of road traffic accidents. If one visits any community situated on a national primary route, its members will indicate the official and unofficial black spots. The frequency of accidents at the latter locations is dramatically high and does not bear out the statistic that road conditions are responsible for only 2.5% of all accidents. We must ask from where the National Roads Authority came up with that figure. The only way to ensure proper statistics are compiled is through the establishment of an independent road accident investigation unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I wish to refer to an Australian newspaper article which appeared 24 hours after a road traffic accident in which witnesses said that the car involved in the accident blew a rear tyre before going out of control and veering across the highway and that the driver made a desperate attempt to avoid the oncoming 50-metre vehicle. Police investigating the accident said the car's wheels appeared to lock as it lurched under the wheels of the lorry. Police do not think speed was a factor in this crash. The article quoted a report from the Australian road accident investigation unit. The UK also has a similar unit and the causes of accidents are investigated. Similar reports are not produced in Ireland because there is no such unit. If one was established, the Minister could return to the House in 12 months or two years and quote accurate figures for the causes of accidents and contributing factors such as alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The Minister should review this issue and ensure a road accident investigation unit is established. The mechanism to establish such a unit is in place through the use of PSV licence inspectors. Given that the NCT company has taken on many of their duties, skilled gardaí are available for such a unit, thereby ensuring an accurate measure of alcohol as a contributing factor in road accidents and other contributory factors. Even though statistics are compiled by many insurance companies, they are never published and the full background to the causes of accidents is not revealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">The issue of prescription and non-prescription drugs cannot be ignored. Drug driving is a growing phenomenon and the medical bureau has highlighted that it is causing difficulties. Testing mechanisms for drug driving must be examined and legislation must be strengthened in this area. The UK is bringing in a "drugalyser" test next year. According to its figures, 15% of fatal car crashes are alcohol related while 25% are drug related, both legal and illegal. Information must be provided to the public, which highlights that prescription drugs reduce a person's ability to drive, and the issue of illegal drugs must be examined. Drug driving is becoming an issue in both urban and rural Ireland. It should be examined now rather than waiting for it to become a significant problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Will the Minister outline his proposals to reform the driving test system? When will he ban drivers who are on their second provisional licence from driving without an accompanied licence holder? He said that measure would be in place before the end of the year but I wonder which year at this stage, although that is not unusual. Perhaps he will shed light on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">It is imperative that bad driver behaviour should be tackled on every front with dangerous drivers punished and careful motorists rewarded. Instruction and research must be improved. Our communities and families must feel safe so that everyone who travels on our roads can return to their homes in one piece. The legislation is a positive development and I look forward to its swift enactment. That is why Fine Gael has facilitated the passage of the legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_237">The Labour Party is happy to facilitate the speedy passage of this short, technical Bill because we support the Christmas anti-drink driving campaign, which is due to begin on Monday. It is a little surprising and disappointing that two technical errors in the original legislation made it through the drafting office, although I commend those who spotted them. That presumably happened within the Department. It is worrying that errors slipped through the net in regard to a Bill that was debated in detail last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">There is no doubt the culture of drink driving continues to be a problem. However, the message has got through to the majority of young drivers and they often put the rest of us to shame in terms of their responsible attitude to driving. Increasingly, young drivers do not even contemplate having a drink and they are to be commended for that attitude. Unfortunately, however, the message has not got though to many mature drivers. If one passes the car park of a large pub anywhere in Ireland on a weekend night, it will be packed with cars. The patrons leave at closing time and one can be sure not all of the drivers have been drinking mineral water for the evening. Substantial numbers of people still go out for a night drinking and think they can sit into a car afterwards and drive home, sometimes with devastating consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">There is a need for a cultural shift and the only way to ensure this happens, other than through regular awareness campaigns, is through regular enforcement of the law. While I welcome the Christmas anti-drink driving campaign, the announcement of such a campaign by the Minister and the Garda is ironic. They are telling people the law will be enforced even though it should be enforced 365 days a year, particularly in the areas of drink driving and speeding. Throughout the year in the run-up to bank holiday weekends and Christmas, announcements are made and we are told we better watch out because the law will be enforced. It is ridiculous that such announcements must be made, but it indicates the extent to which the law is not enforced outside these periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I live in Dublin and it is several years since I came across a Garda checkpoint late at night. This highlights the issue of resources. One wonders whether this legislation has more to do with hype and awareness campaigns, which would be consistent with the Minister's style, than enforcement, which requires additional resources. The experience of the early days of the penalty points system demonstrates that, unless people realise there is a substantial chance they will be caught, they will not change their habits. I hope the Minister will give an undertaking that the necessary resources will be made available in terms of Garda numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I am concerned about the Minister's regular announcements of additional measures, which he expects to be implemented by the Garda, given that Garda resources are a problem. I represent a constituency in which seven murders have been committed in the past seven months. Only two murders have been solved. There are significant public order problems in many parts of Ireland and there are significant demands on Garda resources. While those demands are increasing and less money is available for overtime, the Minister continues to announce additional initiatives that will involve the use of Garda resources. That does not add up and the Garda does not have the capacity to enforce every law, which is what we expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I refer to the Government's promise to recruit an additional 2,000 gardaí, which has fallen by the wayside. Only a handful have materialised since the Government took office. I cannot over emphasise the necessity to tackle that problem and ensure that resources are made available to the Garda to enhance its numbers and capacity. The current situation is very close to breaking point.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">On the wider issues of traffic and law enforcement, another promise has also fallen by the wayside, namely the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps. Although the Minister has been in office for 20 months, there appears to be no progress on that promise. Those of us who are interested in this area are only too well aware of the urgent need for an additional policing corps to enforce traffic law, including keeping bus lanes and clearways unobstructed and dealing with many other traffic offences which are being committed on an increasingly regular basis throughout the country. That is an absolutely urgent requirement. Success will not be achieved in that area unless the Government can deliver on those two key promises which are long overdue – an additional 2,000 gardaí and the establishment of a Garda traffic corps.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Labour Party would like to see the Minister going much further in dealing with drink driving, including his promise to introduce legislation to provide for random breath testing, which we will support. I urge him to ensure that this legislation is available early in the New Year, rather than being delayed as so many other of his promised Bills have been delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">With reference to the road safety strategy, the Minister has been dining out for quite some time on the success of the penalty points system. Undoubtedly, it has been successful in changing behaviour and lives have been saved as a result. However, he should not seek too much glory in this regard. This initiative was promised under the 1998 road safety strategy and finally came into operation at the end of last year – five years late. Very few of the relevant offences have been added to the system, there are approximately 60 other offences waiting to be added and there appears to be very slow progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The Minister is very much behind time, in terms of the 1998-2002 road safety strategy, many aspects of which are long overdue for implementation. As has been stated already, the current road strategy is now almost 12 months late. What is the reason for that? While there is some credit to be taken, there is also a great deal of slippage. The Minister should give that area his urgent attention. Apart from those comments, the Labour Party is happy to support the speedy passage of this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">The Green Party supports this Bill and will assist its swift enactment. Unlike other parties, we do not wish to score political points about difficulties which the Minister has had in the drafting process. However, I take the opportunity to make some broader points about the lack of planning in terms of road safety. The Minister sometimes seems to respond to an expectation of immediate responses on traffic matters, rather than in the context of an overall plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Despite our anxiety to have action taken and our welcome for road safety campaigns over the Christmas period – although there is a valid question as to why that is not in operation throughout the year – what we really need is comprehensive, joined-up thinking with regard to road design, law enforcement and traffic management in general. Apart from immediate responses such as Operation Freeflow or other traffic management operations, we need to start tackling the nuts and bolts of everyday planning and design of our roads and urban environment. It is only when we begin to get that aspect in order that we will begin to see improvements in safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The reduction in road deaths in recent years is, of course, welcome. However, the reality is that the ongoing slaughter of approximately 350 people on our roads each year, as well as serious injuries to thousands of people, is totally unacceptable. We should start from the premise that not a single life should be lost and work from there to achieve that ambition.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">That is how other countries are tackling this issue. Instead of approaching the situation in terms of minor adjustments, they are starting from first principles as to how road safety can be brought to a level at which accidents can be eliminated. That has to be the starting point for road design and driving habits. First, the most vulnerable must be protected, including the young, the old, pedestrians and cyclists, none of whom enjoy the protection of a half tonne metal shell around them. The Minister's first task is to start protecting those categories of road users, following which he should act to protect motorists and other vehicle users. How does one do that? One takes the situation junction by junction and road by road. Junctions are particularly important as that is where many accidents occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">In the context of Garda checks on driving behaviour, it is often difficult to identify improper or incorrect driving on the part of individuals due to the chaotic behaviour of road users in general. That is not necessarily because people are bad drivers, but because we have created a system without proper investment in road safety and design. Although that should be the first aim and objective in transport policy, it is my experience that the priority for road engineers is to get the maximum volume of traffic through the system as quickly as possible. Capacity is their principal criterion, rather than safety. It is time the Minister started to change that situation, so that safety issues take precedence.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The traffic at the T-junction just outside the Kildare Street gates of Leinster House provides a clear example of the problem to which I am referring. It is most unclear who has priority at that junction and there is constant confusion. On many roads in this city, there is no proper delineation of traffic flows. In such a situation, with all traffic weaving, it is quite difficult to distinguish an individual who is driving under the influence of drink. There is widespread failure to obey traffic signals. A foreigner observing our traffic behaviour would get the impression that every driver is drunk.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Our traffic management is based on getting maximum capacity through the system. Drivers habitually take chances at traffic lights, rather than wait 90 seconds for their next opportunity on green. Until we begin to change that mentality and focus on safety as our first priority, we will still have an annual death toll of 350 people on our roads. While the recent reduction is welcome, it is still totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">There is a culture of drink driving in this country. How many of us can honestly say we have never driven a car after taking a glass of wine or whatever? No individual or section of society can take a holier-than-thou attitude in that regard. That approach will have to change, but it is difficult to see how it will be achieved. It will not be achieved through a series of advertisements on television. Unless we can change the system and our behaviour, the exercise will not succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">I welcome the provisions of this Bill, but it is only one element of the long-term planning we need. The type of planning to which I refer is not such that the Minister will get any reward for it. He may not see the results within his term of office or, possibly, that of his successor. However, if we begin to invest properly in our road system on the basis of safety first, particularly for vulnerable users, there will be a long-term reward in terms of lives saved. That should be the Minister's first responsibility, but that is not the impression I get from his reactive decisions to everyday events.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_258">Sinn Féin Deputies will support this Bill. We recognise it as a measure to rectify what could be described as a serious anomaly which has arisen in the Road Traffic Act 2002. We will facilitate the passage of this legislation as we also recognise it as being a necessary measure to ensure the effective implementation of laws that seek to combat drink driving in Irish society. It gives me no pleasure to say that if we are honest with ourselves there was a time when drink driving was almost a socially acceptable behavioural pattern among a significant body of Irish opinion. We saw the harrowing and tragic loss of life as a result, the carnage visited on our roadways and roadsides but, thankfully, that attitude has been rooted out through good education and good presentation of the total unacceptability of driving under the influence of drink.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The number of road deaths and injuries has decreased as a result of a concerted effort on several levels over many years, but the fatality and injury rates still remain unacceptably high. That is exemplified by the many crosses and small memorials erected along the roadsides throughout the length and breadth of this jurisdiction as permanent reminders of those who lost their lives, the victims of road traffic accidents, many of them as a result of drink-related accidents over the years. They evoke memories of loss for the families and friends and communities on an ongoing basis. No effort should be spared in addressing such terrible and unnecessary loss of life on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">We believe a multifaceted approach is needed to address this problem. It must start in the education system. The responsibility attached to the opportunity of driving needs to be instilled in young people at an early age. They are all anxious and eager to get behind the wheel of a car and when they turn 18 the first thing they want is a driving licence. It is important that the responsibility attached to the appeal of a motor vehicle is fully understood before they take those important steps in their lives which may also end up being important steps in the lives of others, if they do not approach the issue responsibly. Addressing this problem also demands effective enforcement of road traffic laws, which is the primary focus of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">It is appropriate to acknowledge that the penalty points system has had an impact in reducing road traffic accidents and fatalities and must therefore be welcomed as a result. It is an example of using a preventive measure to try to address this issue rather than merely reacting to the tragic consequences of a road traffic accident. Lessons can be learned from crime prevention on a list of layers, not only with regard to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The enforcement of this legislation is critically important, but along with enforcement there must be accountability. In our recent submission on Garda reform, we outlined the importance of introducing a number of elements, including policing boards and community policing partnerships at Garda district level. That would introduce an important balance where citizens could have confidence in gardaí exercising the powers vested in them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_263">I also support this Bill. It is meant to tighten and consolidate the Road Traffic Bill 2002 by the correction of a technicality which would affect a driver involved in a road accident being breath tested. The correction refers to a subsection of section 12 of the original 1994 Act in which the power of arrest is set out. The amendment of the reference in section 13 referring to the arrest procedures in section 12 is also necessary. The Minister's introduction of additional measures on 1 December to combat drink driving is also timely in that it is a prelude to the pre-Christmas anti-drink driving campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">On the broader aspect of that campaign, several elements could be introduced in that regard. The bar trade, hotels and other premises that serve alcohol should include reminders on till receipts and display discreet signage that random breath testing can occur. Such reminders could contribute quite handsomely to a reduction in drink driving. The best results can be achieved when information programmes and enforcements are closely linked. That is also necessary. Random breath testing with severe penalties for offenders are warranted since drink driving has long been recognised as a major contributor to the road death toll. There is a link between the two which has been proven.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Other campaigns using a similar approach have been successful in reducing the road death toll, including the campaigns to wear a seatbelt, to reduce speed and for cyclists to wear a helmet. This short Bill will have the effect of making a major contribution to the minimisation of road deaths during the Christmas season, and we certainly hope it will.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The dramatic reduction in the number of road deaths after a year's experience of the penalty points system gives a small glimpse of what is possible with rigid self-discipline on the part of motorists, with 76 lives having been saved and more than 340 injuries avoided. This represents a major saving to the State. Recent costings showed that each road death has cost in excess of €1 million, which is a major cost to the State. However, the lion's share of the reduction in road deaths, close to 60, took place in the first six months after the penalty points system was introduced. It is patently clear that many drivers reverted to their old habits of driving faster, and this is borne out by the figures. The introduction of that system was associated with a high profile advertising campaign, which was effective, but the impact of it became blurred in people's memories after a short while.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Ireland is one of the few EU countries that does not have full random breath testing in place. Only 2% of drivers here are breath tested annually compared to 22% in Sweden. Further sustained changes in regard to drink driving behaviour will be essential if the number of road deaths is to be further reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">The measures in the Bill will provide gardaí with the necessary powers designed to achieve this end. The reversion of drivers to their previous careless driving habits is largely due to the level of Ireland's drink driving enforcement, which has been shown to be the poorest in Europe. It is simply not good enough to mount a vigorous pre-Christmas anti-drink driving campaign and yet not sustain its enforcement on a year round basis. There must be more consistency in that regard. People have got the message that when socialising around Christmas they should be a little more careful and take a taxi home, but that culture does not extend across the year, which it should. More consistency is required in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Rigid, year round enforcement of the law in this area is essential if there is to be a marked improvement in the behaviour of some motorists. We should not be shy in aiming in our national road strategy for up to a 40% reduction in the road fatality rate within the next three years. This is a challenging target, but it is capable of being achieved with a comprehensive programme of action and a shared approach by the Government and the road safety organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Increased emphasis has also been placed on excessive speed reduction, seatbelt wearing, and dangerous driving due to having consumed alcohol by the addition of penalty points. This should go a long way towards helping to change driving behaviour and altering the culture of complacency.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">If motoring organisations were to consider installing tacographs in cars in the same way as they are installed in lorries, particularly in cars driven by motorists in the 18 to 24 age group, such a speed control mechanism would ensure that such cars would not be capable of travelling at high speeds, which are associated with causing deaths. Such a measure would also have the benefit of reducing the insurance premiums for those who would comply with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">Deputy Naughten inquired about the figures for alcohol-related road accidents. Most EU member states experience problems in determining the level of drink-driving that occurs and its association with road collisions. The only information in Ireland comes from Garda arrests for drink-drinking and the test results from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. Available international research indicates that alcohol is a factor in up to 40% of road accidents. I gave the House the figure – estimates in Ireland suggest that alcohol is a factor in 33% of fatal road accidents – and that figure is compatible. The 40% refers to—</p>

          <p eId="para_323">The new section 12(1) of the 1994 Act as inserted by section 2 of the Bill refers to:</p>
          <p eId="para_324">"a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place who, in the opinion of a member of the Garda Síochána–</p>
          <p eId="para_325">(<i>a</i>) has either consumed intoxicating liquor,</p>
          <p eId="para_326">(<i>b</i>) is or has, with a vehicle, been involved in a collision.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Could a person be breath tested for simply sitting in the passenger seat and not being the driver of the vehicle? What would happen if a driver were not behind the wheel? Does a garda need to be of the opinion that the person was driving the vehicle in the first place? From the way the legislation is worded it seems that a garda has to witness the person behind the steering wheel to enforce the provisions of the new section 12(1)(<i>b</i>). If the definition is extended as I propose in the amendment, it addresses cases where a driver is standing outside the vehicle and not behind the steering wheel.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">In proposing the amendment, I understand the Deputy is seeking to ensure the clarity of the new section 12(1)(<i>b</i>). The introduction to the subsection states: “This section applies to a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle”. If I were to accept the amendment, this phrase would be repeated in what is in effect the one sentence. I am satisfied that the current wording establishes a clear basis for the Garda to pursue the application of the requirements of the section. While I know what the Deputy is trying to achieve here, it is not necessary to make the amendment in my view or that of my legal advisers.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The Deputy asked about the passenger. The passenger cannot be breathalysed unless he or she is in charge of the vehicle in the opinion of the garda. This is covered in the first line of the new section 12(1) which states: "This section applies to a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place who, in the opinion of a member of the Garda Síochána -" and goes on to say in paragraph (<i>b</i>): “is or has, with the vehicle, been involved in a collision”. The person with the vehicle would have to be the person in charge of the vehicle. It could not be a passenger who was not in charge of the vehicle. The Deputy's point is covered. Under this section, there is no question of a passenger who is not the person in charge being breathalysed.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">The Minister has made my argument and argued against it. The second part of the first sentence states: "in the opinion of a member of the Garda Síochána". My reading of this is that the opinion of the member of the Garda Síochána applies to (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) as opposed to an opinion of a member of the Garda Síochána as to whether a person is in charge of the mechanically propelled vehicle.

Reference is also made to “the manner in which the person is to comply with the requirement”.

If somebody clearly needs urgent medical attention, then that is the priority and gardaí will be expected to use their discretion in that regard.

        <heading>European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2003 [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</heading>
        <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_379">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The Bill amends the European Communities Act 1972 and enables certain parts of the treaty providing for the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union to become part of the domestic law of the State, once Ireland ratifies the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">This Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad on 6 November. The House is also being requested to approve a motion approving the accession treaty. These are the major steps required to enable Ireland to ratify the accession treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The present process of enlarging the Union could see it growing from the present membership of 15 and a land area of over 3.2 million sq. km., with a population of about 370 million people, to a future membership of possibly 28 or more member states with an area of approximately 5 million sq. km. and an overall population of up to 550 million citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">As Deputies will already be aware, accession negotiations began with six of these countries in 1998, and with a further six in 2000. They were completed with ten countries, excluding Bulgaria and Romania, in December 2002. An accession treaty was signed in Athens in April 2003. Since signature of that treaty, the ten states have become non-voting participants in most EU meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Accession will take place on 1 May 2004, during the Irish Presidency, following ratification by the present and acceding member states. That day will be a defining moment in the history of the Union, and in Ireland's Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Ratification procedures need to be completed by 30 April 2004. To come into effect, the treaty must be ratified by all of the current member states. However, should one or more of the acceding countries fail to ratify it, the remaining countries can still accede. To date, Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Denmark and Germany have completed all ratification procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">All of the acceding states, excluding Cyprus which ratified by legislative procedure, held referenda on accession. The Government warmly welcomes the passage of these referenda. They were clearly supported by the public in these countries by convincing majorities. In fact, majorities in excess of 75% were recorded.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">There can be no doubt but that this enlargement constitutes one of the most exciting and positive developments since the foundation of the EEC in 1957. Each country has made enormous efforts to qualify for membership and they have earned the respect of their European brothers and sisters while taking their rightful place at the Union table.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue in the Dáil. The European Commission recently published its annual progress reports on the acceding states' readiness for membership. The main message was a positive one: great progress is being sustained and only a limited number of urgent tasks need to be undertaken before accession. This is being described as the best prepared enlargement, a remarkable achievement given the sweeping transformation and preparation needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">For today's debate, I want to recall just why this enlargement is happening. It is occasionally worth our while to look back at the remarkable history of Europe in the past ten to 15 years which has taken us to this point. The process of taking in these countries has been described rather poetically as the "soul" of the European Union. The EU is righting a past wrong: the artificial division of Europe which lasted for far too long after the Second World War. It marks a return to normality in the continent of Europe. Accession will allow these countries to turn their backs on years of the threat of chaos, tyranny and poverty which ended hardly more than a decade ago. The accession will underpin their achievement of transforming their societies and economies, and basing them on democratic principles and the rule of law. This will be the cast-iron assurance they are all looking for – that there will be no going back to the grim dark days of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Since its foundation in 1957 with six original members, the European Union has been taking in new members. It has been actively expanding. The values of the Union, as well as its success, have made it attractive to countries with different backgrounds. Any European state which meets basic political criteria is free to apply for membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The first steps which the acceding countries took towards joining the EU began shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communist regimes in central and eastern Europe. Appropriately, the first steps were taken in Dublin. A special meeting of the European Council was convened in Dublin during the Irish Presidency in April 1990. It discussed the unification of Germany and the momentous developments elsewhere on the Continent. It decided to enter into agreements with the emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe. In 1993, the European Council at Copenhagen agreed that these countries could in principle become members of the Union and it also agreed the criteria which would apply to membership, the so-called Copenhagen criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Formal applications for membership of the Union were made between 1994 and 1996 by ten central and eastern European states: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania. Turkey had an application on hand since 1987, and Cyprus and Malta since 1990. Malta's application was withdrawn in 1996, but reactivated in 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">In December 1997, the Luxembourg European Council decided to begin accession negotiations with the six candidate countries which were deemed by the Commission to be ready at that stage for the process. These countries were Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. In addition, the European Council highlighted the work that would have to be done by the Union itself to prepare for enlargement by improving the workings of the institutions. Negotiations with this first group of countries began formally in March 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">In December 1999, the Helsinki European Council decided to open negotiations with all the other candidate countries: Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia. These negotiations opened formally in February 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">European Union membership will be the biggest event in the history of these countries since they gained, or in most cases regained, their independence. Preparations for membership will have taken more than ten years for many of the accession states. Their journey to membership has faced more upheavals and been much more challenging than the journey to accession was for Ireland. We must remember that the process of Community law has moved on in the 30 years since Ireland joined the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">We should not underestimate the struggle involved in reaching the negotiating table, agreeing terms and attaining membership. It has been a long, hard slog for these countries. The countries of central and eastern Europe not only have ensured that political oppression was replaced by a strong and certain commitment to democracy and human rights, but have also had to prepare their economies for participation in one of the most dynamic free markets in the world. They have had to absorb an extraordinary 80,000 pages of legislation, the <i>acquis communitaire,</i> but, more importantly, they have had to take difficult and sometimes painful decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">They have done so because they see, as we did in 1973, EU membership as offering their people the best prospect for a peaceful and prosperous future. All these changes are good for the economies and societies of these countries. The changes may well have happened without the prospect of EU membership but not in the same timescale. They remain, nonetheless, very painful changes for any country to have to go through.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Politically, the stability achieved has been extraordinary and dramatic. Progress in the areas of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities have created stability in a large area of Europe in a relatively short space of time. General elections have seen stable changes in power. These elections have been free and fair. As the recent Commission report indicated, there is still some work to do but a huge amount of work has already been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The process has also been a helpful context in dealing with difficult historical relations between different countries in the region. Some of these issues have not been fully resolved, but prospective EU membership means that the countries have been given the necessary motivation to resolve outstanding problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Structural changes in the economies of these countries resulted to a complete turnaround in their fortunes, leading to rapid growth from new healthy roots. This benefits the existing member states too.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">In the negotiations that led to this treaty, each candidate country has had to demonstrate that it is able to take on the many obligations of membership. This implies the necessary administrative and judicial capacity to apply the <i>acquis.</i> The applicant must also be able to adhere to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The pace of each negotiation depended on the degree of preparation by each applicant country and the complexity of the issues to be resolved. This allowed four out of six countries which started their negotiations at a later date, the opportunity to catch up with those which were already in the negotiation process. On the Union side, the 15 member states were the parties to the accession negotiations. Negotiating positions were approved unanimously by the Council. The results of the negotiations were incorporated into the Accession Treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The Seville European Council in June 2002 was able to conclude that ten countries were ready to conclude by the end of that year. This happened on schedule in December in Copenhagen. The negotiations were long and hard. No country secured everything it wanted, in the same way as we did not achieve everything we wanted in our negotiations in the early 1970s. However, that is not the point. The European Union is a unique institution which advances by compromise and agreement and not by <i>force majeure</i> or by the diktat of the strong. It is precisely because of its momentum on all fronts that the negotiations have grown more complex with each succeeding enlargement as the <i>acquis</i>, the body of law, has grown.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Ireland's approach involved closely monitoring the whole process, especially the accession negotiations in policy areas directly concerning us, for example, agriculture, regional policy, the institutions. We also followed policy developments in other member states and the overall situation in the candidate countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Careful consideration was given to the institutional readiness of the candidate countries, and we have been as helpful as we can. The Government decided to allocate more than €1 million each year for four years to training and advising the administration of the candidate countries in their preparations for membership. That money has been really well spent. At the same time a sustained effort was made to intensify relations with these countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Ireland promoted and supported transition compromises in areas of special needs for the candidate countries where vital aspects of the <i>acquis</i>were not threatened. Ireland also firmly believed that the already complex negotiations should not be further complicated by trying to anticipate future EU reforms, for example the mid-term reform of the CAP and the new financial perspectives. The reason the Government took this approach in negotiations is that we believe enlargement benefits Ireland and, of course, Europe. Ending the artificial division of Europe which lasted for too long after the Second World War is very much in all our interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Europe-wide surveys continue to show more Irish people favour enlargement than people in most other EU countries. The referendum on the Nice treaty last year confirmed this open, positive attitude among Irish people. Sessions of the National Forum on Europe, in which Members of this House took an active part, also bear this out.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Enlargement brings a new dynamism to the Union. Each new member state brings to the table its distinctive identity and rich heritage, its own particular way of looking at the world. New friendships will develop among new and older member states. New alliances will form around common interests and values. The addition of a large number of small member states with whom we have specific interests in common can only be to Ireland's advantage. We are already aware of the synergy and co-operation between our countries in the deliberations on the Convention. It was an eye opener that disparate countries stretched across Europe could have so much in common.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Another example of the potential for developing alliances is in agriculture. Many of the acceding countries are more dependent on agriculture than Ireland and it will be to our benefit that the agricultural interest in the Council of Ministers will be considerably strengthened.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Ireland stands to gain much from a greatly expanded marketplace with over 100 million additional consumers. Assured and free access to the new markets will bring substantial opportunities for this country. An essential contribution to our success story has been our access to the highly profitable market of 380 million potential consumers. Irish trade with these countries has already grown sixfold since 1993, Irish exports to these countries are more than €1 billion and imports more than €600 million. Ireland will also gain from further investment. In terms of Europe, this is not a zero-sum game. The reality is that we are in a win-win situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The admission process for the countries involved has been long and arduous and we have taken a special interest in it. The first step in the negotiations started in Dublin and it is appropriate, therefore, that accession will occur on 1 May 2004 in Dublin during our Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">I thank Members for facilitating, at short notice, the arrangements for the passage of this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GayMitchell" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_413">The Fine Gael Party supports this Bill and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Bill provides the opportunity to reflect not only on the rights but on the responsibilities conferred by membership of the European Union. As we prepare to assume the Presidency of the European Union for the sixth time, it is time to step back and reflect on our responsibilities in general to the Union. We have a responsibility as Members to explain to the people the European Union issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Since the referendum campaign to join the European Communities in the early 1970s the Fine Gael Party has strongly advocated the continuation of the European integration process and on that aspect of our identity as a political party, I doubt if we could be challenged. Fine Gael has strengths and weaknesses but our commitment to the European Union process has been strong from the beginning.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">In the first half of the last century 60 million Europeans, most of them in their prime, lost their lives. If that is not to happen again, we must learn from history and ensure the integration of Europe continues. It is not a question of assimilation, where we all become the same, but of deciding what to do independently and together by pooling our sovereignty.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I know it might offend others to put it this way, but I believe we did not come of age and become "fully sovereign" until we joined the European Union. We were totally dependent on Britain. If Britain devalued, we devalued; if their interest rates went down, ours followed. We produced for the British market and the sale of our agricultural produce depended on their goodwill. That has now changed, and the change has given us great confidence in many areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">For example, there is a great possibility that the Irish language will be saved in Dublin and not in the Gaeltacht. Look at the demand for Gaelscoileanna, primary schools that teach through Irish. It is a pity that the parent driven demand for education through the medium of Irish is not met at second level. That is a direct product of membership of the European Union. People travel and experience other languages and then they want to keep their own language alive. In my view this newfound confidence of our role in the world has come as a result of our membership of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">We want the applicant states to have the opportunity also to gain from membership of the Union. In Ireland, while there have been positive there also have been negative experiences, and in my constituency the car assembly business has disappeared. You take the good with the bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I raise these points in the context of our rights and responsibilities. We have got ourselves into absurd situations because we do not tell the people the truth about certain issues, for example security and defence. We do not seek to argue the case in public and put the issues to the people. There are different views in this House on how we might do this, but the purpose of parliamentary democracy is to listen and then argue about each other's views. There is a very unhealthy attitude to security and defence, for example the way we joined the Partnership for Peace. We should be upfront with the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The debate on this Bill to enlarge the European Union gives me the opportunity to highlight the nonsense that prevents Irish troops serving in Macedonia on the doorstep of the proposed enlarged European Union while we send troop to Liberia, a much more dangerous peacekeeping mission on a different continent. That is wrong and absurd, and we are in that absurd situation not because of the EU treaties or the UN Charter but because of our domestic law and the triple lock we have imposed. This includes the approval of the Government, which of course is necessary, and the approval of Dáil Éireann, which is constitutionally necessary, but the Defence Acts have also imposed a third lock, that it must be a UN-mandated force.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Troops from 13 member states of the European Union – all bar Denmark and Ireland – are in Macedonia keeping the peace, relieving NATO of the responsibility, with the blessing of the UN. Chapter 7 of the UN Charter states that regional activities of this kind, as long as they are in keeping with the purposes and principles of the charter, are very welcome. However, we cannot participate in this. We can send our troops to a dangerous zone like Liberia but not to a less dangerous zone like Macedonia, on the door step of the enlarged European Union, of which we will be President in May 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">That is wrong, and the reason for it has nothing to do with the rights and wrongs of the argument but with the politics of the situation. It is to do with a Government that will not come out straight and say that the situation has moved on, the UN has moved on, the EU has moved on and that we must amend our laws accordingly. I shall be careful in how I put this, but it is wrong for the sake of politics to send our Defence Forces personnel to a more dangerous zone than they might otherwise serve in. There is something wrong about that. The only reason Denmark is not involved in Macedonia relates to its ties to NATO but we are not there because of politics, which is wrong. It is time we were upfront about this and had a debate on it. I hope to return to this at another opportunity in this House before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">This is presented as paving the way for enlargement of the European Union, but so is the Intergovernmental Conference, which may be completed before Christmas – if not it will be completed during our Presidency in the first half of 2004. That Intergovernmental Conference process includes a Convention report which provides for a common defence, as distinct from a common defence policy. I have argued about this a number of times in this House, going right back to the reflection group, the Amsterdam process and before, and I have argued for a protocol to an EU treaty which would allow for a common defence on an opt in or opt out basis for member states that wish to exercise such a protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">If the others wish to join an automatic mutual defence entity from the very beginning, let them do so. I have no difficulty with that. The Convention report has recommended, and the Intergovernmental Conference is considering, the Fine Gael proposal before ever seeing this document. There is to be a protocol on defence. Here is a golden opportunity for the Minister of State, but again we see no leadership, we see a Government keeping its head down. There is no healthy debate in this House and we will see the same outcome as we have seen with the triple lock.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The interests of the Defence Forces and the people will not be served by this sort of politicking. Even now, I urge the Minister of State to work to become one of the architects of a common European Union security and defence structure by being part of the architecture. If the Government indicates that we will become part of the architecture in certain circumstances it will be taken seriously in trying to write the rules. It is possible in a 25-member European Union for 21 of those states to sign up for automatic mutual defence commitments if they so wish, given their attitude to NATO, and for the other four also to be respected and given an opt in provision in this protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">This protocol has not been seen and is not included in the Convention report. It is mentioned that there is to be a protocol but it has not yet been drafted. Now is the time for the Minister of State to get in there, roll up his sleeves and draft that protocol in a way that brings us into a common defence in Europe but on terms that serve our best interests and our view of what Europe's best interests are. If we do not do so the rules will be made by others and, just as now we have our troops in Liberia but not Macedonia, we will join later on terms made by others and maybe not in our interests. For God's sake, we should put the national interest first and politics last for once and put the case to the people to decide. If we are upfront with the people and put the argument to them they will not shy away from it the way we have. It is time for a more open and honest debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I wish to raise two other points. One of the promises made last year in the passing of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 was that there would be more proactive and early scrutiny of legislative proposals from the European Union. I pay tribute to my colleagues on the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny, which I chair, for the great effort they have put in over the past year. At a guess, I think we have scrutinised over 400 draft regulations and directives. However, we discovered recently that there is such a thing as a draft decision, which is not sent to our committee for scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">This particular draft decision concerned the stem cell issue we have all heard about in recent days. I shall not go into the issue itself as we have had that discussion and debate. However, some members of the press who consider themselves liberal have missed the point. The members of the press who are writing that the Dáil is not relevant, needs to be reformed, needs to relate more to the issues of the day and needs to be more of a legislature are the same people who wrote throwaway comments to the effect that the stem cell issue is of no great interest. Not only is it of great interest, it is an issue of ethics, human rights and constitutional and legal importance, but our great friends in the media did not see that.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">One thing they missed completely was that due process was not followed in terms of considering that draft decision. The sub-committee discovered this by accident and sent it for scrutiny to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on its own authority. That is wrong. No matter how difficult or embarrassing a subject is – I have given credit to the Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in giving leadership on this in the past – we must learn that Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann have the right to scrutinise in advance such important decisions. Taking the Oireachtas for granted will not be accepted. Let us at least learn from the stem cell fiasco that this sort of procedure is not on. The Government cannot avoid the embarrassment. If we find the issue we will lift the rock and examine it in any event, so the Government should be upfront, put the issue to the Oireachtas and give it the opportunity through due process to examine all these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">We know there are concerns in Italy, Luxembourg, Austria and Germany. I see the Portuguese have now come up with a formula. Why did we not get the opportunity to express our concerns, rather than having to do so by way of Private Notice Questions the day before the Minister attended a Cabinet meeting? That is in itself wrong, whatever the issue, even if it was car assembly, but this relates to a very important matter. It is not acceptable that Parliament is treated in that way. It is not an indication that there is a realisation across the Cabinet that EU scrutiny is required by law.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I ask the Minister of State, in chairing cross-departmental groups on the European Union and in preparation for the Presidency, to please communicate that to all Departments. The Oireachtas will not accept this, and for as long as I am Chairman of the sub-committee I will not accept it. Whatever the issue, it must come for scrutiny. That is an important principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">As an ardent supporter of the European Union, I am concerned about the manner in which the Stability and Growth Pact was suspended earlier this week, as I am concerned about the self-image of Germany and France as the locomotive of Europe. When a delegation from the European Affairs Committee of the Bundestag, accompanied by the German ambassador, appeared before the Committee on European Affairs several weeks ago, it may have been surprised by the forcefulness with which I raised this issue. I intend to raise it again with the German Minister for European Affairs whom I hope to meet in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Having read various comments on the decision on the Stability and Growth Pact during the week, it has been suggested there was a degree of bullying on the issue. According to today's <i>Financial Times,</i> for instance:</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The fiscal prop supporting Europe's monetary union was knocked away. The message was clear: the European Union has rules, but not everyone has to obey them. France and Germany, long seen as the driving force behind European integration, looked more like a pair of playground bullies. The resulting bitter divisions could have profound effects on the EU's development.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Although I do not know how to bring France and Germany into check, recent images of their conduct, including joint cabinet meetings and President Chirac deputising for Chancellor Schröder at a recent European Council meeting, should not be allowed to pass without comment. The European Union is supposed to be a union of equal member states which pool sovereignty in certain areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">This is a worrying development and I intend to use every possible opportunity to raise it. While we should not be alarmed, we should be concerned and make our view on it clearly heard. As a small state, we were given severe reprimands when our budget deficit exceeded 3%, yet the same rules have not applied to Germany and France. The former, in particular, appears to believe the rules do not apply to it, nor do they appear to apply to the Italians who use a great deal of window dressing in their accounting to comply with the 3% limit. It is time those of us in favour of European integration discussed and debated this issue, rather than leaving it to the extremists, the cynics and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I had hoped to raise another matter but have run out of time. I support the Bill and look forward to seeing the applicant states as members of the European Union. This will be good for their future prosperity and for peace and stability on the continent of Europe, the prerequisites for prosperity. The prosperity of this country will be assured for as long as we have an interdependent, integrated Europe.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_438">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill. In the short period available, I will concentrate on one or two aspects arising directly from the Minister of State's speech and several matters to which he adverted. When those of us who favoured the accession of the candidate countries, on which there is a wide consensus in the House, debated this issue, some Deputies stressed that our reason for advocating accession was the construction of a social Europe. Given that many people will take different aspects of the European project as their primary concern, I want to make clear that I regard the social dimension as the most important aspect of the new Europe being created and of its contribution to an inevitable new global order.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I am concerned by part of the Minister of State's speech. When he referred to the near historical experience of many of the accession countries during the past decade, it was as if a certain kind of history was being written post-1989. I do not have the time or the inclination to debate the significance of 1989 and it would be a little academic to do so, but I will concentrate on some practical aspects of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The countries voting on whether to accept accession have emerged from an atmosphere of restricted and repressed civil liberties. It was also, however, one in which there were guarantees on housing, pensions and labour rights. Our invitation to them and the structure of our debate at the time of the accession negotiations, including the debate on the Nice treaty referendum, was that there was a choice between two models. One of these was the neo-liberal, ideologically driven economic model which emerged from the works of Friedrich von Hayek and others who have been so strongly embraced by the European right but very much practised by the right in the United States in the period of Reaganism and immediately afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">This model offers minimal protection for workers but, again due to time limits, I will confine my comments to pointing out that blue collar workers in the United States have to work 247 additional hours than in 1974 to maintain the standards of living they enjoyed all those years ago. Unfortunately, there is a tendency among the right in the European Union to exploit shamelessly the changing circumstances of Europe and the retraction in global economic growth to seek to re-institute a kind of neo-liberal market which has already been well-developed by some of the Christian democratic and alleged liberal parties. Their strategy is to speak about labour flexibility when in reality they would erode gains made by working people in the areas of security of employment by extending it beyond contract, the right to pensions and the right to minimal standards in the protection of safety at work. We should not underestimate this and the debate on social protection will be a major test.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">In the post-1989 historical reconstruction, one must ask a question about the choice between neo-liberalism and social protection. Some countries have taken different views, with Slovenia, for example, opting for a different approach from Slovakia. Sometimes countries proceed under different influences, with some, for example, opting for a slower growth rate while retaining a maximum degree of social protection, rather than lose it entirely in the name of growth and increasing inequalities.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">We might be expected to make a contribution to this conversation. While I do not want to distort the position of the Government in making a choice between neo-liberal market extremism, which may be supported by others in the House, and social protection, I believe the Government would probably opt for a social model. While I am willing to accept this position to a point, it would come from a country with the highest or second highest levels of income and the lowest or second lowest levels of social protection, whether in child care, the right to housing, the right to health or other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The Progressive Democrats Party, in particular, crows regularly that this society is becoming richer but omits to mention that it is the scandal of Europe. If Sweden is at the top of the league in terms of tax levels and also has the highest levels of social protection, the Progressive Democrats Party version of society is to measure the misery index in terms of the level of tax one must pay for social benefit. Let us not, therefore, imagine that this debate has gone away because it has not. It is also relevant to the comments of the Minister of State to whom I am not imputing a position but pointing out that the issue will need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The Lisbon summit of 2000, for example, was the first on employment, economic reform and social cohesion. It set out a new and ambitious objective for the European Union, namely, to achieve a competitive, knowledge-based economy in the world which would, according to the text, be based on full quality employment with increased social cohesion. This meant that economic and social progress were to go hand-in-hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">We hear regularly appeals to be realistic and not to be party political. I wish to be realistic. As a trained sociologist, I spent most of the 1970s at seminars listening to people making speeches on the working day. It was expected that we would soon have so much leisure time in Europe that we would not be capable of handling it. All sorts of disasters were predicted. People had more time on their hands as the working life grew shorter, the working year shrunk with more paid holidays, and the working week shrunk as did the working day. Suddenly, the claws of the neo-liberal right, which are revealed regularly by the Progressive Democrats and the small sections of Fianna Fáil which they influence, come out. It is suggested that we should be prepared to work longer for the economy. If one is not willing to work past 65, it is suggested that one is being disloyal to the economy, dislodging it from its position and interfering with growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The old 18th century notion that there must be growth before there can be equality is rehashed by these people. This is an inversion of an old philosophical argument which has long been discredited. I welcome the accession states to the EU and the Labour Party will agree to this legislation for that reason. However, in nearly every one there have been strikes. I visited the foreign affairs committee of the parliament of one accession state where I was told of strikes among health workers, people working in the housing sector and public sector workers. No one should say that these states were in the depths of darkness prior to the opening of accession negotiations or characterise those negotiations as an invitation to the land of milk and honey. I stress the importance of a social Europe and the construction of a new view of the Union because one should not try to escape from one form of darkness only to encounter another. More thoughtful trade Unionists throughout the world are examining the challenges to protections which were won over a period of struggle which lasted more than 100 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">I say the following to be positive. It is sometimes said the Swedish vote represented a kind of great negative to the European Union. In fact, the vote was quite progressive. The Swedish view was that its social protections would be better protected by rejecting what they consider to be the instability of the Stability and Growth Pact. Advanced Swedish opinion saw that it was faced with the extraordinarily backward view of greedy people who believe that all one's money should be for oneself and that one should construct security fences while letting everyone else go to hell. This is the neo-liberal Progressive Democrat view. The Swedes stress the importance of the public sphere and we will too as we move through the Presidency and find ourselves welcoming the accession states after May. It behoves us to speak about citizens in Europe as much as about consumers. I am becoming a little wary of the idea of listening to all the consumers whose markets will be more accessible to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">A romantic Europe is regularly invoked. There is nothing wrong with a romantic view of Europe's past or of its future, although romanticism is probably not the best concept to use given where it brought us. We have to examine the way in which we speak about citizens. This is not an impractical or vague concept. Public sector broadcasting, the right to tell one's own story, the failure of the European Union to curb the concentration of ownership, its facilitation of private monopolies while it restricted and sought to roll back public service broadcasting are all issues which have been reflected in the adaptation of the accession countries to the <i>acquis communautaire.</i> A raft of uncommercial and economically unviable private broadcasting licences have been issued. It was suggested that it was part of the process of adaptation to establish a market in this area in a short period. These are important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I take a positive rather than a negative view of the arrival of the accession countries. I saw the applicant states as countries which could contribute to a neglected aspect of the European identity, especially in terms of culture. For many reasons which I do not have time to develop now, culture is not mentioned in the founding treaties of the European Union. It is referred to in one line of Article 1.2.8 of one treaty which suggests that culture may be taken into account. We are tested at a moment like this as to what we mean when we speak about Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Deputy Gay Mitchell has his view with which I profoundly disagree. The new Europe which is to be created must be built on trust and the rediscovery of a capacity to bring political solutions to bear rather than on fear. Political matters should not be treated as security issues. People differ on the status of these two approaches. I am profoundly of the opinion that recent events and Europe's role in the world represent a vindication of multilateralism and belief in international institutions. If one wishes to reform those institutions, one should do so. If it is hampered by the veto process, we should reform the Security Council. One should certainly not have resort to extra-council initiatives of the regional kind which have no mandate and which are unlikely to be supported by the General Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Only this week we have seen the return to the production of lower order nuclear weapons by the largest power in the world at the same time the EU was involved in a dialogue with Iran. It is difficult for ordinary citizens to understand how one can make a strong case on Iran and Korea, with which I agree, while the United States of America returns to the production of nuclear weapons and bunker breaking equipment. One always runs the risk of being accused of being anti-American when discussing these matters, but the truth must be spoken. If what one says is political truth, people must hear it. The defence budget of the most powerful country in the world this year is of the order of more than $950 billion. The cost estimated by the United Nations of providing clean water, mass primary education and freedom from the four major infectious diseases is $88 billion. That is approximately 8% of the armaments spending of a country which spends more than the next 12 of its friends combined or all 28 of its perceived enemies. It spends 18 times more on defence than do the countries which comprise the axis of evil. In developing a response to that, the European Union should not ask how it can have its own military structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The employment of the world's resources in terms of expenditure, intelligence, scientists and technologies to make medical advances and social improvements through better insulation and housing is a political matter. Therefore, I do not welcome the unpicking of the Convention process to the point at which we see regression in any of these areas. Gains were made by socialist representatives at the Convention on a social Europe and social protection. Gains were also made by those who have advanced the case for giving real meaning to sustainability. These gains are not available for unpicking. It would be a regressive step to reopen the matter at the Intergovernmental Conference to enable narrow, neo-liberal, right-wing aims to take the place of these gains. It is not my intention to question the nature of the Intergovernmental Conference process, but as Deputy Gay Mitchell has reminded us, this is a Parliament and I am entitled to make my views known here. The Deputy has his views, but my perspective is that gains have been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The indivisibility of rights and the addition of economic, social and cultural rights to political rights as elements of a future version of Europe which was envisaged at the Convention is resolutely opposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at every level. I am not certain that the Intergovernmental Conference process has got off to a great start in so far as it seems to be providing an opportunity for the re-articulation of backward positions that we defeated in the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I emphasise that as far as I am concerned, I regard the accession countries as ones that challenge us. When I visited some of them and spoke to people, they pointed out that they joined to help create a Europe of the future based on a social model and not a backward version of something that existed previously with eroded rights. The Government has a difficulty in that it is carrying a large burden of that backward thinking which would push us away from such a model and would create something rather like the very limited rights-type of economy in the United States. We live a real world where we say rights are not available, whether in the workplace, the home, socially, ecologically or environmentally, and that which we have gained, we propose to hold.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_456">I am sharing my time with Deputies Harkin and Ó Snodaigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. The Green Party has always stated that it is pro-enlargement and, indeed, we campaigned in many of the accession states for a "Yes" vote. I made it clear in Malta and the Czech Republic that we favoured a "Yes" vote. I visited the Czech Republic a week before its referendum and what was quite remarkable was the even-handed way in which they approached the issue of membership of the European Union. There was no sense of tipping the forelock to the great masters beyond. They knew what they were getting into and knew the benefits and the drawbacks. They see, and have always seen, themselves as Europeans. Indeed, many years ago a delegation from the former Czechoslovakia visited the European Parliament. One of the speakers in the Parliament welcomed the delegation to Europe to which the representative from the delegation responded by saying, "We have always been here." That is a fact. They are true Europeans and they are now becoming members of the European Union. They have no sense of inferiority whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The level of propaganda is remarkable. I remember when the eastern European states were liberated from the Soviet Union, we were constantly told about the terrible conditions, particularly about environmental degradation. I was at a conference in 1989 at which someone from the former East Germany spoke. He said he was tired of listening to rhetoric about how bad things were in his country in terms of the environment. He listed the achievements of the former East Germany as regards sustainability, to which Deputy Michael D. Higgins just referred. In the former East Germany, all paper was recycled, it only had three types of bottles, all of which were recycled, more than 80% of journeys were by public transport and CO2 emissions were low. Of course, it had bad localised pollution problems but we need to put this in perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The new constitution – I take issue slightly with Deputy Michael D. Higgins on this – does not represent a great advancement in terms of sustainability. I do not see an advancement on the Amsterdam treaty, for example. That is where we have remained stagnant. We are lucky we have not gone backwards, and that has been claimed as a victory by some.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">An interesting dynamic will be introduced as a result of the membership of the accession states. The Americans were quick to seize on old and new Europe – new Europe being the smaller states which make common cause with the United States and which see the future of European defence, in particular, as part of NATO. It is interesting to note that this old and new Europe is really a myth. Some 16 of the 25 states in the enlarged EU were in favour of war in Iraq, and that needs to be stated over and over again. They would far prefer to see European defence moulded in the shape of NATO and are not too keen on this European defence identity being espoused by the French and the Germans, in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">However, the one thing we noticed at the Convention was that they very much shared our point of view on the institutions. In particular, they were opposed to the idea of a president of the Council. It was remarkable that so many people stood up at the Convention without any tick-tacking, I might add. It was not a case of people being told to say one thing and others being told to say something else – it was spontaneous. People stood up and said "No". I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, who does not seem to agree with me. He did quite a lot of negotiating behind the scenes and I congratulate him on that and on the evenings he held. He managed to galvanise so many people. The Government may have been slow off the mark but it certainly got its act together towards the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The views of these states came from the heart and they were genuinely opposed to the idea of a president of the Council and the abolition of rotating Presidencies. They wanted the partnership of equals to continue within the European Union. That is the project they joined and which needs to continue. They see what is happening now as the big countries versus the small countries. When they see what is happening as regards the stability pact, can they have confidence when there is one rule for the big countries and another for the small ones? We need a Europe in which there is equality.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_463">I welcome the opportunity to state once again my party's support for the upcoming enlargement of the European Union and future enlargement. As republicans, our roots lie in European solidarity and we look forward to the accession next year of the Czech Republic, the Republic Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, the Slovenian Republic and Slovakia. Many of these states have common experiences with Ireland. They have suffered colonisation and military occupation.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">At present these countries face similar challenges to those we faced in recent decades in terms of economic and social recovery. I have sought on occasion, and I support the Minister of State in seeking, common cause with these countries, especially the smaller and economically weaker states, because our future in the European Union depends on the friendships we build now and as the European Union grows. Ireland should build partnerships with other small, militarily neutral and progressive states both within the EU and outside its borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I note with satisfaction that all the accession states with the exception of Cyprus held a referendum on EU membership to allow the people decide, which is a welcome development. Existing EU member states should learn a lesson from that and should be encouraged to ensure all countries in the EU hold referenda on future EU treaties, including the constitutional treaty which is still being debated and put together. I urge the Minister of State to ensure the constitutional treaty is put to the people not only in this state, which has a good record on referenda – in fact too good a record in that it held two referenda on the last treaty – but in all the states of the European Union. It was good to hear that this week Clare Short came out in favour of a referendum in Great Britain despite it not having a constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I regret that in the forthcoming enlargement Cyprus will not join as a unified state, as we and all within the Union had hoped. Instead, it is joining as a partitioned and occupied state. Hopefully, that will soon be resolved positively. The EU must support and encourage Turkey to end its occupation of Cyprus so that it may also be accepted as a member. One member cannot militarily occupy another – that includes this island. Sinn Féin would welcome a human rights compliant, non-occupying Turkey into the EU once the situation in Cyprus and the Kurdish conflict are resolved in a manner which respects the rights of these populations to self-determination. That Turkey has a majority Muslim population would add a positive dimension to Europe and offer potential to reduce conflict in the Muslim world.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I also welcome the progress towards accession being made by Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. We need to start debate now on the plans for future enlargement, specifically the move towards the creation of a free trade area covering all the Euro-Mediterranean area under the Barcelona process. This is a controversial and complex issue with far-reaching implications. It needs to be fully debated in the House and in the public sphere at the earliest opportunity rather than coming at us through the back door or when we are struggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I encourage any development towards a Europe of equal partnership rather than towards the plan many European leaders seem to have of creating a superpower of some sort. Hopefully I am wrong about this plan and all who were on the "No" side can be proven wrong. We will have to wait and see. I welcome the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_469">I am pleased to have a few minutes to speak on this truly historic European Communities (Amendment) Bill. We can now look forward to a vision of Europe no longer torn apart by war and conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">We were not part of the mainstream of European conflict over the past century. We had our own conflicts and many of us were only on the periphery as the heart was torn from Europe. I often heard my mother refer to "the war". While it loomed large in her life it featured more on account of the day to day practicalities of rationing etc. Its impact on those who lived in Europe was different. It shaped their lives. It gives one faith in the human spirit and the resilience of human nature that post that conflict we have managed to move forward to the fragile beginnings of what we now call the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">We are now being asked to share the vision of a Europe bound together by economic, cultural and social ties. It is a Europe of nation states bound by common values and aspirations. In some ways it seems like pie in the sky when former enemies, divided empires and states seek to form the new European family. The great thing is that it is not pie in the sky. This is real and within our grasp. It is not all good or all bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Something which has intrigued me during our debates on Europe is the black and white nature of the debate. Europe represents all that is good for some people and all that is threatening for others. I must agree with Deputy Gormley that it has its benefits and its drawbacks. Looking at the package as a whole, we must decide if we want to take part in shaping it and to be part of the process. I wonder if Irish people are happy with their decision to vote "Yes" to the Nice treaty. Are those who advocated and voted "No" content with the outcome which will allow the new accession states join the EU in May, as they have clearly indicated they want to do?</p>
          <p eId="para_473">When I campaigned for a "Yes" vote on the Nice treaty I used the idea of neighbours. I pointed out that Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia border Austria, that the Czech Republic and Poland are neighbours of Germany and that it is better if neighbours get on together and pool their resources. I know this is a type of neighbourhood watch philosophy sounds a bit like "The Waltons", but I am glad Ireland has not stalled the process in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Over the past year we have had the European Convention and the draft treaty. I have no time to speak on those issues but they have presented new challenges. I hope that in our debate we will look at the bigger picture as well as the finer detail. The draft treaty has many positive aspects as well as areas of concern about issues which must be clarified. That this treaty provides us with an opt-out mechanism where an individual state can vote against the treaty without affecting the future of other countries within the EU is important. This will ensure we have an informed debate. The outcome of our vote will hugely influence our future, hopefully in but perhaps out of Europe. This is a huge challenge for us, particularly politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I listened to the debate in the Seanad this morning with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox. An important point was made that if we do not connect the single citizen, whether Irish, Italian, Cypriot or whatever, to the EU, we are in danger of losing momentum. We must speak in plain language if we are to connect the citizen. Eurospeak alienates people. I am pleased to hear that the Irish EU Presidency will take the opportunity to decode Eurospeak and use language which will help citizens better understand the EU and its institutions and, more importantly, will connect citizens to European ideals.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">On the matter of connecting citizens to the EU, I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Gay Mitchell earlier when he referred to the scrutiny of EU legislation and the recent stem cell fiasco. Two committees of this House asked for a full debate in the Dáil and Seanad on this issue but it took a Private Notice Question to get some brief discussion on the issue. This is unacceptable. People see it as a rejection of democracy. We cannot allow it to happen because it frightens them and puts them off the EU, although it has nothing to do with it but has to do with how we conduct business in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">We would all like to feel we have some control over our lives and our future. Within that context we would like to have some influence on world events. We recognise that as individuals we are virtually powerless. However, as members of the EU we have influence, although not always as much as we might like. We can leave our fingerprints on world events and as Irish citizens influence global events. To do that we must take our courage in our hands and move forward as partners. We can retreat to the periphery or take our place with our neighbours. I hope we choose the latter option.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Mr. Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_478">I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill and to make a few observations on the European Union. This is an historic time for Ireland and the European Union. It is the eve of our assumption of the EU Presidency for the sixth time, the final time we will assume the EU Presidency under the current institutional arrangements. I wish the Taoiseach and his Ministers well in their endeavours. In the past Taoisigh, Ministers and our civil servants fulfilled their duties with distinction. I have no doubt this will be the case again and we look forward to a successful EU Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Enlargement is one of the big issues on the agenda for our EU Presidency and that is what this Bill is about. The accession of the ten new members on 1 May will be an historic occasion. In his Second Stage speech the Minister caught the sense of history of the occasion when he stated, "There can be no doubt that this enlargement constitutes one of the most exciting and positive developments since the foundation of the EEC in 1957."  He also referred to Europe finding its soul, the division of Europe in the past and the problems that resulted from the Second World War and the various dictatorships of the previous century.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The Minister of State's comments reflected the historic nature of this occasion for the new democracies of eastern and central Europe. It is obvious that ensuring that the accession of the new member states goes smoothly will be an important part of our Presidency. Ireland's Presidency will continue the efforts being made in respect of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. I wish the Presidency every success in that regard. I have reservations about the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union. I hope its membership will not import instability into the Union. A great deal of work remains to be done by the Turkish Government in that regard, especially in respect of human rights and the Cyprus issue. These matters can be discussed at another time.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Lisbon strategy will be another important aspect of the Irish Presidency. Ireland will seek to re-inject momentum into the strategy in light of the current economic circumstances and the enlargement of the EU. We should try to tell people exactly what the Lisbon strategy is. It attempts to create growth and provide employment. If we can convince people that the strategy will have real and tangible benefits for the citizens of the State, we will have done a good day's work. I wish the Presidency every success in driving that agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I cannot speak about priorities such as justice and home affairs issues and external relations because I have time constraints. I am delighted that the Government intends to give priority to development issues. The Joint Committee on European Affairs has requested that problems in Third World countries, such as HIV-AIDS and debt, be prioritised. It is important that we highlight such issues during our Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">It is obvious that the Intergovernmental Conference will be extremely important. Although I hope that certain issues will be resolved before the end of the Italian Presidency, I do not doubt that we will rise to the occasion if it falls to us to conclude the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I would like to speak about the treaty that will put in place an EU constitution. We need to sell the treaty properly because it will be put to the Irish people in a referendum. The people should be told that it is a final treaty. They are not pleased when we bring referendums to them on a regular basis. They are familiar with our Constitution and are aware that certain EU treaties have been ratified. The fact that they do not like us to refer matters to them unless it is absolutely necessary is demonstrated by the low turnout in some polls. We need to tell the people that the new treaty relates to bringing peace and stability to Europe and consolidating and simplifying existing treaties. The EU will be made more transparent and the democratic deficit issue will be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">We should make clear that this is the last time that we will ask them to vote on an EU matter in the foreseeable future. People will engage with the issues if we clarify these matters. The initial reaction of some people may be to say: "Here we go again, another European Union treaty, what is it about, we do not understand it". We need to drive home the fact that it will be the final EU treaty for many years to come. The treaty will simplify the existing provisions and make this area much more readily understandable. It will highlight the benefits of the Union in bringing about peace and stability. It fits in well with the process of enlargement which is under discussion today.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">I would like to discuss the details of the Intergovernmental Conference. Taxation, security and defence and the criminal law aspects of justice and home affairs are key matters for Ireland. I am delighted that the Government supports a reference to God, or our Christian heritage, in the preamble to the constitutional treaty. I support the Government in that regard. I wish the Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, every success during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_487">I will address the points made by Members during the course of the debate. Although there were few contributions, they were particularly apposite and focused. Some of the points that were made deserve to be commented on.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I was struck by Deputy Gay Mitchell's opening comments. He was right to state that no civilised human being could take pride in the history of Europe in the previous century when 60 million Europeans were butchered. It was industrial murder on a vast scale. I remind those who are critical of the European Union that the 50 years since the end of the Second World War have comprised the longest period of peace and tranquillity enjoyed on the European continent for many millennia.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Deputy Mitchell also made a point that I have alluded to on a number of occasions. People's fears 30 years ago when Ireland joined the EEC have not transpired. Our experience has been the opposite to that predicted by such people. The Deputy made the valid point that there is now a more vibrant interest in Irish culture, language and dance – our expression of what we are – than there was 30 years ago. We were much more subservient then. We have reason to be proud. Who could have forecast 30 years ago that there would be a resurgent interest in gaelscoileanna at primary and secondary levels? Who would have suggested 30 years ago that Irish dance would become one of the most popular expressions of culture in the world?</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Deputy Mitchell also spoke about the attitude we need to adopt. He made another point that I have made several times, namely, that Ireland's membership of the European Union has been a liberating experience for us in a very real sense. We have emerged from under the cloak and started to express what we are. Although we have found that it is a challenging world, we have risen to the challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The Deputy also spoke of the need for an informed, dispassionate and factual debate about where we are going in respect of defence issues, especially at European level. Although I may disagree with where he thinks we should go, I agree with him that we should have a more informed debate than has been the case in the past. He made a specific reference to the role that can be played by neutral or non-aligned states at EU level. I agree with him on a fundamental level in that regard. I will make history next week when I will become the first Minister from a neutral or non-aligned state to address the Western European Union assembly. I will argue that such states can bring something special to the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Deputy Michael Higgins, who was as provocative and thoughtful as ever, spoke about the need to construct a social Europe. He said that we need to protect the advances we have made in this regard, especially in the Convention on the Future of Europe. The Deputy and I agree that the convention was a marvellously open and democratic way of dealing with business. It was infinitely better than the way in which any previous treaty had been dealt with. It was open and upfront. There were no smoke-filled rooms. The Intergovernmental Conference which followed it has been rightly criticised because it is more of a virtual Intergovernmental Conference than a cross-table process. At least it is more open than previous such conferences.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Deputy Higgins spoke about constructing a real social Europe, in which everybody participates. May I be inelegant, by agreeing with the suggestion that participation should not be confined to those who can get their snouts to the trough? I share the Deputy's notion of a social Europe. We worked for such a Europe at Mr. Katiforis's working group, as part of the convention process.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I would like to take the Deputy mildly to task, however, in respect of his comments about the charter of rights. I think I am right in saying he claimed that it is resolutely opposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. The Minister is a big boy and more than capable of defending himself. However, that portrayal or characterisation is not correct. It is false, though I am sure that it was not intended to be so. The issues which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been pressing for in the justice and home affairs areas would be supported absolutely by Deputy Michael D. Higgins if we had a better debate. The point is vindicated in the document that is going to the conclave this weekend. The Minister has been making the point that it is inherently extremely difficult to reconcile the common law and civil law traditions and that we must be very careful in the process going on, particularly in justice and home affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">On justice and home affairs he has made the point that we must be extremely clear that the civil liberties that we take for granted in our system are not trespassed on. Deputy Michael D. Higgins will agree with me that common law, warts and all – I do not necessarily believe that it is the absolute pinnacle – particularly in this country, where there has been the fortuitous development of a very strong constitutional tradition, protects the individual and must be protected. That is the Minister's point, and I agree with him. I am sure that Deputy Michael D. Higgins agrees with him too.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">I was giving the Deputy the opportunity to clamber back on board reality, but no matter. My most generous efforts are rebuffed. Deputy Gormley spoke about the attitude which brought the European Union to its current state. He reflected a rather romantic view of the German Democratic Republic, certainly going on what I know of it. I will take him up on one point. He said that 80% of all trips in the German Democratic Republic were made by public transport. Of course, the alternative was to wait 25 years to buy a Trabant.</p>

          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_500">It was to buy one Trabant. I make that point though it has now become an icon. He mentioned the unity of purpose among the small member states in the Convention and also pointed out that it was not a matter of large states versus small ones. He was certainly correct there. The whole purpose of the Friends of the Community Method Group, in which I was very proud to play a leading part, was to emphasise the unity and equality of Europe. We were not looking for any way to steal a march on some of the larger states. If the same sense of purpose existed among the larger states in Europe and they accepted the equality of Europeans in the same way that we did, it would be a better place. The divide between large and small is essentially destructive.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Deputy Ó Snodaigh touched on the same issue when he referred to the necessity of ensuring that there is not one rule for the big and another for the small. That was also implicit in several of the other contributions. I agree with him. "Rules is rules", as the saying goes. They should apply to the big, the small and the insignificant. Deputy Ó Snodaigh also touched on the issue of EuroMed. That is interesting, since we are giving that some attention in the context of the upcoming Irish Presidency. If the wind blows on our back and we have the opportunity, Deputies will see the absolutely unique focus of a northern European state on the EuroMed area.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Deputy Harkin spoke of the Bill's historic nature and how what we are doing speaks to the European spirit. She is right on both those points, and that the dream of a Europe at peace is becoming a reality. Her sentiments have been expressed on many memorable occasions. She mentioned the speech by the President of the European Parliament that has just concluded in the other House. He favoured the Government and me with a reference to something that I want to do – bring Europe back to its citizens. I want to end as much gobbledegook, doublespeak, Eurolanguage and exclusive language as we possibly can. We are planning an initiative on that area during our forthcoming Presidency, and the positive response that we got from all the institutions to the first feelers we put out is fascinating. We will be able to do something. Quite an extraordinary breakthrough is possible there. We will not achieve everything that we want during Ireland's Presidency, but I want to set up a communications strategy which links Europe to its citizens and builds bridges, speaking in less exclusive language in future. I have already been speaking to two of the three further Presidencies coming after us, and they are enthusiastic supporters, so a process will be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Deputy Haughey spoke about this being Ireland's sixth, and the last classic, Presidency. He is right, since the new constitutional treaty will come into effect, and we will have a different Europe of 25 members. We look forward to a successful and challenging Presidency. We have put in a vast amount of spadework, and with a modicum of luck, it will be a good, very fruitful and historic Presidency. He said, as Deputy Gay Mitchell did at the outset of the debate – lovely synergy when it goes full circle – that we are closing the doors of history. On 1 May 2004, there will come a fantastic defining point. It is a marvellous moment for us to be alive and witness the doors of a tragic, brutal, butchering history being closed and the doors of a new history being opened for Europe. We can take real pride in the role that we have played in Ireland, including those for and against the Nice treaty. We demanded a level of debate. I agree fundamentally with two final points that Deputy Haughey made. One was on the Lisbon strategy, which, after enlargement is highest up the agenda. The second matter was building up a system of communication with the people. I have already referred to that, and he is absolutely correct.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">I understand precisely the point that Deputy Michael D. Higgins is making. However, although the European Coal and Steel Community is now defunct, we believe on the best legal advice that the references in the Bill are necessary. The right time to remove them is when it is decided that it is appropriate to consolidate the legislation relating to EU transposition. In plain as opposed to official language, the appropriate context in which to deal with a number of issues is the constitutional treaty. I mentioned to Deputy Michael D. Higgins privately that there is a reference in our own legislation to the Kingdom of Norway, which is of course not a member of the European Union. Much work will be required in the context of the European constitutional treaty which will impact on and regularise all those issues. I understand his point and that he wishes to achieve clarity, but the strongest advice we have is that it is necessary to leave this here at the moment but that consolidation will take place in the context of the constitutional treaty. I am not sure whether the Deputy wishes to press the amendment. We accept the sense of what he is proposing, but this is not quite the right time to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_509">The Ceann Comhairle's office has been in communication with me regarding amendment No. 6, but I wanted to make the point. I wished to insert a new form of text before section 2. The net effect would have been an amendment to the European Communities Act 1972 regarding procedures. The amendment's purpose was to terminate the power to amend Acts of the Oireachtas by ministerial regulation where necessary to comply with European Union law. The power is misconstrued. This is a power which should only be used in genuine emergency and such emergencies are allowed for during a recess period plus 28 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">My point, in seeking to insert this form of words is that where the EU law must be implemented by a Bill, involving the amendment of a statute, the process should be one which is much more accountable to the Oireachtas. It offers further scrutiny. Regulations which do not amend Acts can be made in the normal way and are not affected by my amendment. I am drawing a distinction and seeking to define that which it is appropriate to do by way of transmission in regard to ministerial order. I suggest that the facility allowed in the 1972 Act should be curtailed, otherwise there will be a suggestion – rather like taking the Minister of State's argument – of constitutionalism, which we can discuss another day. If the Minister of State were to take the letter of that into account, he would see that he should accept such a formulation.</p>

The references to the European Communities seems to be somewhat out of date, although the Communities still have a separate legal existence from the founding treaties.

          <p eId="para_516">I will not contest the fact that it is tedious, pedantic or legalistic. However, it is a requirement. If we were to use the word "Union" in this context, it would be misleading. The Bill deals with the Community measures only, which are the first pillar or elements in the original treaties. The Union deals with the wider issues of the matter, which was subsequently added. We had a lengthy discussion on this matter in the Convention. There is a rather bizarre situation where there is reference to the "Union" on the one hand and the "Communities" on the other. We will be consolidating the position in the next constitutional treaty, when the Union will become the title for it. It is not possible to make the amendment the Deputy seeks, although he is echoing my sentiments in trying to make things as logical and clear-cut as possible. However, as the legal position stands, we cannot go that far. The issue is addressed in the constitutional treaty. Therefore, I am not accepting the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">This Bill provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of a body to be known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The establishment of the PIAB is one of the central aspects of the Government's insurance reform programme. Its objectives are to tackle the delivery cost of speedier compensation to genuine claimants, while reducing the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses alike. To attract renewed competition into the Irish insurance market, we must ensure that we improve our claims-cost profile.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">It is widely accepted that litigation costs add on average in excess of 40% to the cost of compensation, which has contributed to the high cost of insurance and the cost of claims against the growing self-insured sector, including the State. These costs are a threat to the health of the economy, job security and competitiveness in an enlarged European market. By eliminating the need for litigation costs, where legal issues are not in dispute, the PIAB will significantly reduce the cost of delivering compensation to the benefit of all consumers. The PIAB will offer a lower cost and speedier means of finalising genuine personal injury claims than the current litigation system.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The PIAB is not a creation of the insurance industry as some lobbyists have alleged. The concept of an alternative to the courts system has been mooted for a long period. It dates from the days when our former colleague, Des O'Malley, held the relevant ministerial office, through the Deloitte &amp; Touche report in 1996, the term of office of former Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the 1999 IBEC-ICTU voluntary code on workplace safety. These reports called for an alternative to the courts system.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">In March 2001 the Government approved the establishment, on a statutory basis, of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. An interdepartmental implementation group was established to progress the concept of the PIAB within an initial mandate to address personal injuries claims arising from employers' liability insurance. That group, comprising representatives of relevant Government Departments, was established in April 2001 and reported in 2002. In June 2002 a specific commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government had the practical effect of reconfirming the Government's decision of 20 March 2001 to establish the PIAB. On 27 November 2002 members of the interim board of the PIAB, under the chairmanship of Dorothea Dowling, were appointed and tasked with setting up the board on a statutory basis. The interim board has contributed enormously towards shaping the proposed operating procedures reflected in this legislation and also in progressing the logistical operations required to set up the new body.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The primary purpose of the legislation is to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board as a statutory body. The board will be charged with making assessments, without the need for legal proceedings to be brought, of compensation for personal injuries. The role of the PIAB will be confined to claims where legal issues are not disputed by the respondent. It will commence operations early in 2004 with employers' liability claims before encompassing public liability and motor accidents in mid-2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The priority of the PIAB will be to implement fair procedures in accordance with the principles of natural justice as they apply in this "documents only" system of assessment. There will not be any oral hearings in the PIAB process. In the current legal system, fewer than 10% of claims reach a trial before a judge in court and the 90% that are settled without a trial are considered to carry an excessive litigation overhead. Despite such a low level of court trials, over 70% of cases involve barristers compared to only 4% in England. The objective of the PIAB is to assess compensation at current levels, but to do so more expediently while eliminating the excessive litigation overhead. The PIAB is not being set up to reduce the level of awards to genuine claimants. While parties are entitled to seek independent legal advice at any stage, the PIAB will not award litigation costs for or against any party but special provision will be made by the PIAB to protect the interests of vulnerable claimants.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">There have been various calls stating that the PIAB should allow for representation for claimants and comments to the effect that it is unfair to claimants who are not represented. Insurers, on the other hand, have such expertise. There are a number of untruths being accredited to the PIAB process which need to be clarified for once and for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">This is not an adversarial system and representation will not be required. There is no role for advocacy on either side. As already stated, the PIAB will not conduct oral hearings. Once a respondent consents to an assessment proceeding, he or she will have very limited input. If a claimant's medical report is questioned in some specific aspect by the respondent, the PIAB will then refer the claimant to an independent medical examiner and that report will form the basis of the assessment. If a respondent queries the claimant's alleged loss of earnings, the PIAB will set about verifying the alleged loss. The PIAB will avail of its own expertise, either from its staff or from appointed independent consultants, to assess the validity of a claim. It will not indulge in an adversarial process between competing parties' experts. Insurers do not employ lawyers until after legal proceedings are served. Why would they waste their money when their claims handlers make these decisions in assessment only cases at pre-litigation stage?</p>
          <p eId="para_534">It has also been alleged that respondents will consent to a case going to assessment with the full intention from the outset of rejecting the award and fighting liability in court. This makes no financial or tactical sense. Why would a respondent waste fees on the PIAB and then incur litigation costs? Delaying a case never operates to the advantage of the respondent but always enhances the value of the claim with the passage of time, which hampers rehabilitation. If potential defendants consider that they have good prospects of defending a case in full, they are anxious to do so at the earliest opportunity so that the reserve against potential liability can be taken off their books. The rules of court in defended cases already require plaintiffs to reveal their medical records in the course of litigation as held by the Supreme Court in October 2003 in the case of McGrory <i>v.</i>ESB. This is not a game of poker. Those days are over.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Even earlier disclosure of the details of a plaintiff's claim is envisaged by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's proposed legislation. The civil liability and courts Bill will also enhance the prospects of successful defence of exaggerated claims. The latest data from the Courts Service indicates that only 3% of High Court hearings resulted in the dismissal of a claim. In some cases, the judge may have made a deduction for contributory negligence, but what is the point of an employer seeking to obtain 15% off an employee's compensation if it costs an extra 50% in costs to pursue that uncertain result? Many employers will be satisfied to ignore that contributory negligence for the purposes of the PIAB assessment when there are substantial savings available in both time and money overall. There is absolutely no tactical advantage in raising the potential plaintiffs expectations by allowing a PIAB assessment to proceed in circumstances where the respondent intends, from the outset, to fully defend liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Furthermore, claimants and respondents who unreasonably reject PIAB assessments may end up incurring additional costs in subsequent court proceedings. The argument that respondents will consent to a PIAB assessment with the intention from the outset of rejecting the award, does not stand up to any logical scrutiny. The option for an employer to have an employee's claim independently assessed without admission of liability also enables genuine injured parties to secure their compensation without waiting for the outcome of adversarial litigation between a number of defendants among whom liability may ultimately be apportioned by the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Regardless of whether a claimant has employed a lawyer, the PIAB will always communicate directly with claimants so that they know exactly how their cases are progressing through each stage of the assessment process. Legal representation would prevent the claimant knowing exactly what is being alleged on his behalf. It would effectively cut the claimant out of the communications loop, whereas the PIAB wants the claimant to know exactly what is happening at each stage of the process and why a certain step is being taken. The concept of legal representation also exposes the claimant to additional and unnecessary costs for adversarial tasks, undertaken by solicitors, which are completely at variance with the inquisitorial ethos of the PIAB. Such representation would also mean that the cheque in payment of the award would go to the solicitor in the first instance and not to the victim of the accident who has been awarded the compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Legal representation is only relevant to legal issues. The PIAB will not deal with any disputed legal issues. It will not inquire into the circumstances of the accident, only the extent of the injury and resultant losses caused. As clearly stated in the legislation, nothing in the PIAB process can be used to prejudice those parties in any subsequent litigation. Equally, nothing prevents a claimant from seeking independent legal advice if he or she so wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The PIAB assessment process of general damages for pain and suffering will be based primarily on medical reports from a claimant's treating doctor, as sought by the Law Society in a submission on the PIAB. In some cases, a claimant will be examined by a member of the independent medical panel established by the PIAB. A book of quantum will be compiled and published as a guideline to general damages for various categories of injuries and from which parties can satisfy themselves as to the reasonableness of PIAB awards. This guide should also assist parties in reaching negotiated settlements without recourse to litigation. A similar book of quantum in England reflects that only 4% of cases there involve barristers compared to their involvement in 70% of personal injury cases in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Assessors in the PIAB will calculate allowable special damages for items such as wage losses and medical expenses on the same basis as the courts, taking into account the pending amendments to legislation on credit for collateral benefits received and compliance with tax legislation. In contrast to the current adversarial system of personal injury litigation, the approach adopted by assessors in the PIAB will be inquisitorial. This means getting to the facts of the claim and ensuring the claimant gets that to which he or she is entitled – no more and no less. This approach will be of assistance to claimants on many issues where they might currently seek legal advice, even in "assessment only" cases which do not involve legal disputes.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">From the planned effective date, all relevant non-litigation cases, which currently require legal proceedings to be issued, will be subject to mandatory referral to the PIAB before they can proceed to adversarial litigation. If the respondent wishes to dispute legal issues or has reservations about the genuineness of the claim, the board will immediately issue an authorisation for the claimant to proceed to litigation, if the matter is to be pursued further.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">At the end of the PIAB process, parties have an unfettered right to reject the award, as sought for on behalf of claimants by the Law Society in its submission on the board. Parties are entitled to reject the award if they consider that they would secure a more favourable outcome through the court system. The board will issue an authorisation for the claimant to proceed to litigation within a specified timeframe if the matter is to be pursued further. During the PIAB process, time will not run against the claimant for the purposes of the Statute of Limitations on the period within which legal proceedings must be issued. Among the other tasks delegated to the PIAB is a cost benefit analysis of the current litigation system. While the interim board had hoped to progress that project, it was denied access to the relevant data, without the statutory powers which are provided for in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I will summarise the main provisions of the PIAB Bill. Section 3 outlines the type of civil actions to which the legislation will apply. It is intended that the legislation will initially apply to employer liability claims only but will be extended in due course to cover motor accident, public liability and other types of claims. The PIAB will not deal with cases involving medical negligence nor claims for which a specific statutory scheme has been established, such as the Garda compensation scheme. Section 6 refers to the fact that nothing in the legislation affects legal proceedings brought before the commencement of this section. This section also allows for parties to agree a mutually acceptable settlement at any stage during the PIAB process.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Section 7 provides that nothing in the legislation affects a person's right to seek independent legal advice in respect of a relevant claim. While there may be a need in some instances for advice on filling out the application form and on deciding if a PIAB award is reasonable, the board will operate a helpline to assist claimants with their application and fully explain how assessments etc. are made. Furthermore the cost of such legal advice should be minimal. Section 29, to which I will refer later, has special provisions relating to vulnerable claimants.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Sections 9 to 18 deal with the PIAB application process from claimants covered by this legislation. Applications for assessment will be made in a prescribed form and accompanied by prescribed documents such as a medical report from the claimant's treating doctor, copies of the original letter of claim and receipts in respect of outlays for which special damages are sought. Liability issues will not be raised by the PIAB. A claimant cannot bring court proceedings in respect of a personal injury claim without first applying to the PIAB. The PIAB will notify the respondent of a claimant's application and ask the respondent if he or she consents to an assessment being made. If the respondent intends to dispute legal issues, the PIAB will issue to the claimant an authorisation, which will permit him or her to institute legal proceedings. Otherwise, the case will proceed to assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">In cases where there are two or more potential respondents the PIAB process permits one of the respondents to allow the case proceed to assessment without prejudicing the respondents in subsequent proceedings to seek an indemnity or contribution from other parties. A respondent's agreement to a claimant's submission for PIAB assessment will not constitute an admission of liability nor will it be used in any other manner to prejudice legal arguments in subsequent court proceedings. The PIAB will have discretion not to proceed with a case which is more appropriate to the courts, for example, new medical conditions upon which there is not sufficient legal precedent or it is of a complex nature etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Sections 19 to 38 deal with the assessment procedure. An assessment will be made by assessors employed by the PIAB on the same basis as an award of the courts calculated by reference to the principles, which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort and relevant statutory provisions. Assessments will be made by reference to information and documents provided by the claimant. There will be no oral hearings. Assessors will refer to the book of quantum in assessing general damages. Payments will be made in the form of a once-off lump sum, as is the current position in the courts. In cases arising from fatal accidents, the assessments will state the amount to be set aside for each of the dependants of the deceased but such cases will be subject to the ruling of the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The PIAB will have the power to levy charges. Funding of the PIAB will be primarily on a "case by case fee" payable by the respondent as the most transparent and equitable distribution of costs. Respondents will pay a standard administration fee as well as the costs of experts' fees necessarily incurred by the claimant, for example, the cost of independent medical examination in certain cases. Claimants will pay a small refundable administrative fee, which must accompany their application to the PIAB, if they have not secured a satisfactory settlement directly, that is, claims will initially be made directly in the usual way against the respondent.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The PIAB will be able to request such information from the claimant or respondents or third parties, as necessary, to make an assessment. The board may initiate an examination of the claimant by a practitioner from the independent medical panel where the claimant's medical report is not comprehensive or conclusive or where the claimant's medical condition is disputed by the respondent. The board will have the power to request from other bodies, excluding the Revenue Commissioners, information that is necessary to properly validate losses claimed as well as benefits received, which will be deducted from the assessment. This includes access to the national vehicle file recording the identity of the vehicle insurer for cases arising from motor accidents. The board will also have limited powers to request from the Revenue Commissioners information relating to the income of the claimant for the purpose of verifying any item of financial loss alleged by the claimant.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The board will make special provision for vulnerable parties and will take steps to ensure the application process is straightforward and its staff will provide assistance to either party where required and explain the consequences of a party taking or not taking a step during the process. Where necessary, the PIAB will advise of the desirability of the claimant seeking outside advice. The board will issue details of the assessment to the claimant and respondent outlining separately the amounts for special damages and general damages. Parties will be requested to reply within a specified timeframe as to whether they wish to accept the assessment. The claimant will have 28 days to decide whether to accept the assessment while the respondent will have 21 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">If a claimant neither accepts nor rejects an assessment within a specified period, he or she will be deemed to have rejected the assessment. If the respondent fails to respond to the assessment within the specified period, he or she will be deemed to have accepted the assessment. This proposal is in line with the service of legal proceedings where failure to respond within a specified period results in a judgment in default. If an assessment is not accepted by either party, the claimant will be authorised to take proceedings within a specified timeframe if he or she so wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The acceptance of the assessment by both parties is binding on them as full finalisation of the claim. These provisions also provide for cases where there are multiple respondents and they do not all accept the assessment. Regardless of acceptance by the parties of the PIAB award, in cases where the claimant does not have full legal capacity, then a ruling is required by the court. Where the court does not approve the assessment, the claimant will be authorised to take proceedings within a specified timeframe. Nothing in the PIAB process is to prejudice any of the parties in subsequent litigation. Where assessments are accepted, the PIAB will issue an order to pay to the respondent.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Sections 39 to 43 deal with the legal status of an order to pay which will have the same status as a court decree. Payments to a claimant on foot of an order to pay constitute a satisfaction of the claimant's relevant claim. Part payments constitute partial satisfaction. Provision is also made to enable the injured party to receive the compensation to which he or she is entitled, leaving the apportionment of liability between potential co-defendants to be decided by subsequent litigation or negotiation without prejudice to the right of the respondent. The discharge of a claimant's claim by the participating and accepting respondent will not prejudice that respondent's right in subsequent litigation. The respondent may seek recovery of his or her outlay in whole or in part from another party who had a liability in respect of the accident which caused the claimant's injuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Section 44 allows that in certain situations the board may direct that, where a claimant incurs an expense, this will be borne by the respondent. An example might be where a complicated medical condition follows an accident and updated medical or other experts' reports are required to reflect the full extent of the claimant's claim in terms of medical prognosis or the extent of financial loss. In such a case, the PIAB will direct that such expenses are necessarily incurred and are to be paid by the respondent.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Section 45 recognises that, where a claimant lacks full capacity because he or she is a minor or of unsound mind, a ruling of the court is required and the claimant's legal representation will be directed to be paid by the respondent. Section 46 permits the board to make rules which will be in separate regulations. These rules will outline the detail of the procedural operations of the PIAB, including the amount of fees to be paid by the claimant and the respondent.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Section 47 provides for a claimant to withdraw his or her claim if he or she so wishes. If he or she does so, he or she may not make a fresh application or bring proceedings. This will be fully explained to claimants by PIAB staff. Section 48 gives the PIAB the facility to make assessments on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for cases where litigation proceedings have commenced but where both the claimant and other parties make a joint application for assessment. Section 49 provides for the making of assessments by the PIAB within specific time limits, unlike the current litigation system where no such target dates are set for completion of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Section 50 provides that the period from the date of application to the PIAB and ending six months from the date of issue of authorisation to commence proceedings will be disregarded for the purposes of the Statute of Limitations period. Section 51 provides that PIAB assessments shall not be admissible in subsequent proceedings unless the proceedings concerned are in connection with the enforcement of an assessment that is being accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Section 53 provides for the establishment of the PIAB which, subject to the provisions of the Act, will be independent in the performance of its functions. Section 54 provides for the functions of the PIAB, including making assessments of relevant claims, preparing a book of quantum and carrying out a cost-benefit analysis of the current system. Sections 56 to 62 provide for matters relating to the membership of the board and conduct of business by the board. The board will include members with relevant expertise, such as that in the legal and medical field.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Sections 63 to 66 provide for the appointment, functions and terms and conditions of a chief executive officer. These sections also provide for the answerability of the chief executive officer to the board, the power of the chief executive officer to delegate functions to staff, and the accountability of the chief executive officer to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees. The recruitment process is being progressed by the interim board.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Section 67 provides for the appointment of staff to the PIAB. Staffing numbers, grades and remuneration will be determined in consultation with the Minister for Finance. Section 68 provides for setting up of a superannuation scheme in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Section 69 provides for indemnification from actions and claims arising out of members of the board or staff of the PIAB carrying out their functions. Sections 71 and 72 provide for the disclosure of interests by members of the board and staff of PIAB and also matters in relation to such disclosure or non-disclosure. Section 73 provides that members of the board, or staff or consultants engaged by the board shall not disclose confidential information without consent of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Section 76 provides that the chief executive of the board will keep accounts of the board's income and expenditure and submit estimates of same as requested by the Minister. Section 77 provides for examination of the accounts and records of the board by any person appointed by the Minister in respect of the financial year.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Section 78 provides that the board, as soon as practicable after the establishment day and within six months of each fifth anniversary, will produce a strategic plan. Such plans will comprise the key objectives, output and related strategies, including use of resources of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">Section 80 permits the board to engage consultants or advisers as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions. Section 82 provides that a member of staff of the board who is a lawyer may appear on behalf of the board in an application under section 27.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The cost of the PIAB will be covered by fees levied on respondents on a case by case basis at a standard minimum rate plus outlay incurred on experts' opinions in more complex cases. Fees will be set with a view to the PIAB breaking even financially. PIAB fees payable by insured defendants will be covered by their insurance policy. An original proposal that the PIAB should be funded by a levy on the insurance industry was rejected by the interim board as this would merely be passed on to policyholders, whereas the State and the self-insured sector will also benefit from the assessment service available from the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The annual running costs for the PIAB, when fully operational, were estimated at between €7 million and €8 million in the report of the implementation group set up to progress the establishment of the board. Exchequer funding will be required to cover the establishment costs of the PIAB, estimated at €2 million in the implementation group report. Cash shortfalls in the initial period of operation will be covered by Exchequer funding until the PIAB starts to break even financially. Exchequer funding requirements have been agreed in consultation with the Minister for Finance in the context of the annual Estimates process. A sum of €5 million has been put aside in the context of the 2004 Estimates, but Exchequer funding beyond 2004 is not envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The establishment of the PIAB is a key element of the Government's insurance reform package. Ireland's reform initiatives are being watched closely by the UK, where the court reform programme introduced in 1999 has failed to reduce litigation costs and businesses are now facing a growing insurance cost crisis. I am convinced that the introduction of the PIAB as well as the other reform initiatives being undertaken will lead to a properly functioning market that will attract new entrants into the market and provide the much needed competition to drive premia down further.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_569">In principle, the Fine Gael Party will support the Bill. However, there are a number of issues we wish to tease out on Committee and Report Stages with the Minister of State and, more especially, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. I note that the Tánaiste did not accept any amendment in the Seanad. I hope she will be in a more flexible frame of mind when she appears before the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. We have a diligent committee and a strong Chairman in the person of Deputy Cassidy, who will insist, on an all-party basis, on a high standard of legislation emerging from that committee in the interests of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board is one of a number of initiatives the Tánaiste has trumpeted as a means of reducing insurance costs in Ireland. She has consistently stated that her first priority in Government, for as long as she remains at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment – we note that she does not wish to stay much longer – is to bring about a reduction in insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The Bill before the House, together with another Bill on civil liability put forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, are presented as the cornerstones of a reform programme on insurance costs. The Tánaiste has suggested that insurance costs can be reduced by more than one third once the reforms are put in place. While I do not doubt the sincerity of the Tánaiste's objective to tackle high insurance costs, the measures she is taking will not be as effective as she thinks, primarily because she is placing far too much reliance on insurance companies behaving reasonably and responding positively to her initiatives. In all the measures she adopted to address the insurance crisis, she has not sought any bankable guarantees or meaningful commitments from insurance companies that they will pass on to the customer the necessary reduced premia she desires. She seems to be prepared to take insurers at their word and expects them to respond reasonably and fulsomely to the reforms she is initiating.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The Minister seems to forget that insurance companies do not operate to any public service agenda but rather, like most commercial organisations, are focused on issues of profit and shareholders' returns. That is their overriding objective in the marketplace and will remain their first priority. Given the scale of the problem of insurance costs, I find it incomprehensible that the Minister has failed to secure clear and unequivocal commitments from insurance companies that the establishment and operation of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, will result in lower premia for consumers and businesses. I can envisage the scene being set already for insurers to argue that the establishment of the PIAB will not result in lower insurance costs. For example, recently the chief executive of one of the major insurers in Ireland told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that he would not commission the company to making reductions in premia as a consequence of the establishment of this board. I find it difficult to accept that statement. Surely insurance companies that are aware of the patterns of claims and settlements must be in a position to estimate the extent of these savings as a consequence of the implementation of the PIAB. It is bizarre that leading insurers, with supposedly excellent sources of management information, cannot predict the savings that will result if the PIAB operates effectively. This raises a concern about insurers' attitudes and actions in regard to the PIAB, a matter to which I will return later, but it also calls into question the types of commitments the Minister has received in the past from insurance companies and their bona fides about reducing premia for small businesses and consumers generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">There is no doubt that a cheaper and more effective means of delivering compensation to genuine claimants is required. The legal system has not served Irish claimants well, given that it has resulted in the slow delivery of compensation over the years, a high level of costs and increased insurance premia for consumers and business people. Establishing an alternative system for the delivery of compensation such as the PIAB has merit provided that it is effective, realistic in its targets and objectives, fair and balanced in the performance of its functions and that it contains some element of compulsion for claimants and respondents to avail of its recommendations. The PIAB has a role to play provided it is an assessment board and not another layer of bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The Minister suggested in the debate in the Seanad that the PIAB would have 100 staff, a budget of €5 million and would deal with 27,000 claims per annum. This is a massive and extremely ambitious target, particularly given that the board is starting from scratch. To deal with such a volume of work over such a tight period of time, the PIAB will need to deal with cases expeditiously, if it is to avoid being another layer of bureaucracy. It is important that the PIAB is allowed to get established and operate on the initial category of claims that have been assigned to it, particularly liability claims, before overloading it with additional categories too soon. Like every new body, the PIAB will have its teething difficulties, but zealousness and over-ambitiousness must not be allowed to frustrate the board in the performance of its functions. While we all admire the sense of purpose and efficiency of the chairperson of the interim board, it is important that over-ambitious targets are not set at too early a stage in terms of the categories of claims that the PIAB must address. The PIAB must be allowed to find its feet with employer liability claims before moving on to motor or public liability claims. That would represent a good, prudent and sensible approach. If it takes longer than the six months envisaged for it to move to deal with other areas of claimants, we should allow such time as is necessary to get this right.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">My concern is that the establishment of the board and other reforms the Government is initiating will not result in lower premiums for consumers and businesses. The problem of insurance costs arose from a myriad of factors. The Bill merely addresses one aspect of the factors contributing to increasing costs. There is the cost of delivering compensation to claimants, high legal costs, false or exaggerated claims, the "compo" culture and the level of awards delivered, particularly by lower courts – we all have played a role in increasing insurance costs. However, there are also more complex reasons which the Minister has not addressed. Some insurers blame the aftermath of the events of 11 September as a reason while others allege that problems have arisen because of the lower returns on investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Getting to the bottom of the problem of insurance costs is made all the more difficult because of the lack of publicly accessible, timely and transparent data. Much of this data are generated directly by the insurance industry. I hope that the consumer director of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority will act quickly to ensure that there is transparency in the figures being circulated by insurance companies. I raise this concern because I have a problem with some of the figures presented by the insurance industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">In its report, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board drew attention to the fact that losses on motor insurance in 2000 were largely driven by the creation of extra reserves for the cost of accidents in 1998 and previous years rather than events in 1999. This trend continued in 2001 and 2001. The insurance industry reported underwriting losses on motor insurance in 2000 and 2001, but in 2000 more than half of the losses was caused not by events in 2000 but by the creation of approximately €150 million in extra reserves for accidents that happened in 1999 and previous years. Similarly, in 2001, the industry reported underwriting losses of €174 million, and that was after charging at least €100 million to create extra reserves for accidents in 2000 and for previous years.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">More recently, the industry has argued that current reforms are working, pointing out that in 2002 an underwriting profit of €18 million was made in motor insurance. Underwriting profits for all insurance companies in 2002 was €183 million. The difficulty is that until the insurers make full statutory returns at the end of each year, policy holders have no way of knowing how much of a turnaround there has been in the fortunes of insurance companies and whether improvements are due to improved road safety, lower claims or how much of them are due to taking back the reserves they created in previous years. It is arguable that on closer examination of the losses made by insurers between 1999 and 2001 many appear to be driven as much by accounting decisions taken by some insurers as by events in the marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Similarly, we should be concerned about the returns on investments that insurance companies are securing. When assessing the investment returns that insurance companies here secured, they seem remarkably low even compared to the returns on low risk investments in Government stocks. In a non-competitive market such as we have in the provision of many insurance services, firms have no incentive to do anything other than increase their premiums to maintain their profits. The key point here is that much of the data about profitability and losses both in general and in regard to particular lines of underwriting activity are entirely dependent on information or material provided by the insurance industry. This information needs to be independently assessed and verified to ensure that the high premia businesses and consumers have suffered and continue to suffer will not continue to occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">We want to ensure that these particular losses are the product of genuine factors that have given rise to increases in cost and are not attributable to cute or manipulative accounting procedures. For example, I am puzzled as to why motor premia will be able to fall by the extent recently predicted by companies before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small business, and yet insurance companies seem unable to pass on reductions for employer liability policies. It does not make sense that reductions in premia arising as a result of fewer cases being taken, fewer fraudulent cases and more moderate awards, do not transfer to business liability cover as well as motor cover.</p>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_582">Tá soláthar iomlán de €32.193 milliún curtha ar fáil do Údarás na Gaeltachta sna Meastacháin don bhliain 2004 i gcomparáid le €32.72 milliún i 2003. Baineann €10.193 milliún den soláthar seo le caiteachas reatha, agus is méadú 17% é sin ar an méid a cuireadh ar fáil i 2003. Tá mé thar a bheith sásta leis an méadú seo mar go mbeidh caiteachas fiúntach substaintiúil á dhéanamh anois i réimsí a bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint leo maidir le sealbhú agus buanú na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, mar shampla, naíolanna, naíonraí, cúrsaí óige, comharchumainn agus forbairt phobail i gcoitinne.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Maidir le caiteachas caipitil de, tá soláthar de €22 milliún á chur ar fáil i mbliana i gcomparáid le €24 milliún i 2003. Bainfear úsáid as an soláthar seo chun clár forbartha a chur i gcrích i ndáil le caiteachas caipitil ar fhoirgnimh agus infheistíocht i dtionscail.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Ní mór a aithint go bhfuil athruithe suntasacha tagtha ar chúrsaí tionsclaíocha agus eacnamaíocha na tíre seo le blianta beaga anuas, agus tá an scéal mar an gcéanna sa Ghaeltacht. Sna cúinsí uile, tá i gceist ag an údarás díriú ar earnálacha nua fostaíochta, mar shampla, réimse na teicneolaíochta faisnéise, tionscail teanga-bhunaithe, fiontair a bhaineann le hacmhainní mara agus nádúrtha, an geilleagar sóisialach agus an turasóireacht chultúrtha. Ar ndóigh, ní bheidh na réimsí nua seo chomh dírithe ar chaiteachas caipitil is a bhí na sean-réimsí déantúsaíochta, a raibh monarchana móra le trealamh agus innealra trom i gceist leo. Táim sásta go bhfuil soláthar caipitil sásúil curtha ar fáil do 2004 ag cuimhneamh ar an éileamh ar dheontais thionsclaíocha nua a bhfuiltear ag súil leis.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Ní mór a chur san áireamh freisin go bhfuil sé molta ag comhairleoirí neamhspleácha gur chóir maoin dár luach €20 milliún i seilbh an údaráis a dhíol thar thréimhse. Ach an cur chuige seo a chur i bhfeidhm de réir a chéile, bheadh foinse breise ar fáil don údarás chun infheistíochta a dhéanamh i réimsí nua.</p>

Nach bhfuil sé fíor go raibh an t-airgead ag an Aire don olltoghachán agus go bhfuil laghdú an-mhór ann anois? Ní hionann iad an dá rud, agus ní féidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair atá beartaithe aige in aon chor, agus tá an-díomá ar fad air mar a dúradar i ráiteas le déanaí. Cad atá le rá ag an Aire faoi sin?</p>

          <p eId="para_587">An t-am seo anuraidh, chuir mé €3.5 milliún breise ar fáil. Mar sin, más é an olltoghchán a bhí mar údar do rud ar bith, nach bhfuil sé aisteach gurbh é tar éis an olltoghcháin a cuireadh €3.5 milliún breise ar fáil? Tá mé ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht, agus is dóigh liom nach bhfuil an mórphictiúr á scrúdú. Tá 6.5% ardú i Meastacháin na bliana seo, ach rinne mé cinnithe é a chaitheamh ar bhealach a bhí difriúil ón tslí ar caitheadh roimhe seo é. Tá níos mó á chaitheamh ar an nGaeilge agus níos lú ar fhoirgnimh. Mar atá mínithe agam, ceithre bliana ó shin, nuair a bhí mar Aire Stáit sa Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, shíl mé go mba cheart go mbeadh athrú polasaí a bheith ann maidir le tógáil foirgneamh. Ón mbliain 1997, tá €100 milliún curtha ar fáil le haghaidh foirgneamh ar son tionsclaíochta sa nGaeltacht. Ag an am sin, mar atá léirithe ag na figiúirí a cuireadh ar fáil ag cruinniú bhord an Údaráis, tá na cíosanna ag laghdú, agus tá riachtanais ag athrú go mór sa nGaeltacht. Creidim, leis an gcur chuige atá á láimhseáil agam, go gcruthófar i bhfad Éireann níos mó postanna ná mar a chruthófaí dá leanfaí ar aghaidh leis an sean-mhodh oibre a bhí ag an údarás. Bhí plé ann le príobhfheidhmeanach agus cathaoirleach an údaráis inniu a bhí thar a bheith tairbheach. Dúirt siad inniu go raibh daoine ag maireachtáil go compordach taobh istigh den airgead a bhí curtha ar fáil don bhliain 2003.</p>

Nach bhfuil sé fíor ó thaobh an airgid iomláin a chaith an tAire de, idir scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht agus Údarás na Gaeltachta, i mbliain an olltoghcháin i gcomparáid leis an bhliain seo chugainn, go bhfuil laghdú €18 milliúin ann?

      <b>Mr. O'Shea</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
      the way in which it is intended to apply the moneys provided in the Estimates for 2004 for the RAPID programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [28697/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_597">In my Department's Vote for 2004 a total of €5.8 million has been provided under a new subhead for the RAPID programme. The breakdown of this amount is €4.5 million for capital expenditure and €1.3 million for current expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Many of the proposals from RAPID plans have been sent to Departments for consideration when it would be much more efficient for them to be dealt with at local level. To this end, a dedicated fund of €4.5 million has been set aside for capital expenditure for the programme to support such projects. This funding will be used as leverage to facilitate co-funding from State agencies. I hope to make an announcement shortly on the precise way in which the money will be spent but as I have previously stated, area implementation teams will be involved in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The sum of €1.3 million in current expenditure will be provided for ADM to meet administration expenses and provide support for area implementation teams.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_600">Will the Minister agree that there is an inherent contradiction in the provision of RAPID programme moneys having regard to what is being dispersed by the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Board? The RAPID programme process is now being bypassed at local level. Over the last two years the social inclusion measure groups and area implementation teams prioritised the processing of applications. However, a sum of €30 million will now be dispersed per annum, targeted particularly at RAPID, CLÁR and local drug task force area programmes, bypassing the work done by the social inclusion measure groups and area implementation teams.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_601">I sympathise with what the Deputy said and I am genuinely interested in the point he made. Legislation was passed to create an independent Dormant Accounts Disbursement Board. It is important that these types of schemes resonate the demands of the benefiting communities. I will keep what the Deputy said in mind to see how we can avoid giving funds to RAPID programme areas that might not be seen as having top priority through the process. However, I approved the plan and was anxious that as much money as possible would be ringfenced for RAPID programme areas, in particular. However I cannot be sure whether the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, which is independent, will dovetail that with the requirements in the AIT plans. The Deputy has raised an issue that warrants ongoing examination. I have noted what he has said and I will keep it in mind as events unfold.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_307">
          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_602">I find the Minister's response encouraging. However, this has been a demoralising decision for the two groups, the SIMs and the AITs, that have worked so diligently over two years. More is required than simply carrying out a review. They must be brought into the mainstream of this process. I understand the capital sports grants are endorsed at a local level. Surely that should happen here.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The RAPID programme has made appallingly bad progress. The Minister has made a virtue – I do not necessarily disagree with him – of saying that the macro decisions should be taken at a Department level and the micro decisions at a local level. This flies in the face of that policy. Substantial funding is available which is targeted at the RAPID areas. This seems like quite a retrograde step that highlights the muddle that is the administration and bureaucracy of RAPID.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_604">What the Deputy says is music to my ears and mirrors my general thinking on these matters. I am somewhat old-fashioned in thinking we need a fairly simple streamlined system of Government. With only 4 million people, every citizen has access to all of us as Members of the House. All these tiers only complicate the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I would like to focus on how we will spend the €4.5 million, over which I will have direct control as it is Department money. I had a very fruitful meeting with the AIT co-ordinators. When I examined all these plans there were many small issues. There were housekeeping issues over maintenance of local authority estates and safety issues over the provision of CCTV cameras or speed ramps to prevent so-called joyriding. There were other issues involving small sports projects and areas of rough ground that young children were using for cider parties, etc. Those issues should be addressed. They are in all the plans. To ask a Department to process those is undermining the AITs.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Somewhat similarly to CLÁR, I intend to use these moneys and ask the AITs to provide a menu of the items that are repeated in the plan as exists in CLÁR. The AITs should decide what to choose from the menu. As with CLÁR there should be matching funding, which would mean that the €4.5 million could leverage €10 million or maybe €15 million worth of action in one year. If this were done over two or three years we would see considerable difference on the ground. The beauty is that it deals with the small ones. It shortens the list of items that have to be handled by the Departments.</p>

I am committed to RAPID and once I have finalised my thoughts on it I am willing to give a detailed briefing on how I intend to make the programme really effective on the ground in line with the AIT plans next year.</p>

      <b>Mr. Boyle</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
      his views on the recommendations of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Plan 2002-2005.
      [28694/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_611">The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department. The board presented its disbursement plan to me for approval this summer and following detailed consideration of the plan, including consultation at Cabinet level, the plan was approved by me on 30 September, subject to a number of amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I welcome the recent publication of the board's plan and the commitment to allocate €30 million annually to assist the personal, educational and social development of persons who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged or persons with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">In particular, I am very satisfied that a significant level of allocations from the fund will be targeted at programmes or projects within RAPID, CLÁR and drugs task force areas. I strongly believe that a reasonable proportion of the moneys available should be directed towards projects in areas designated by Government as experiencing particular social and economic disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I am also very satisfied that funding for persons with a disability is to be prioritised towards those requiring more intensive levels of support in the areas of health and personal social services. This will have a very positive impact on the lives not only of those with a disability, but on their families as well. In addition, the inclusion of IT as a measure to tackle disadvantage is important in promoting access to – and competence in – technology, in particular for young people in disadvantaged areas and for persons with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The challenge now facing the board is to implement and give practical effect to the plan. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that the board has engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. An invitation to organisations, groups, etc. to make applications for funding under the scheme was advertised in the national press on Friday last, 21 November. ADM will receive and assess applications for funding and make recommendations to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board for decision.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_616">I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he accept that the establishment of the fund was accompanied by the hope that the moneys disbursed from the fund would be additional funding? Even though the recommendations are valid and will be gratefully received, the Government may have avoided the responsibility of providing funding directly from the Exchequer for many of these areas. While the recipients of the money may care little about its source, this is an account with a very short shelf life. Many of the areas to which the funding is being provided require committed ongoing funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The Government has a responsibility to state its long-term priorities in many of these areas. We had exactly the same problem with the establishment of the national lottery, resulting in many areas receiving funding from the lottery rather than from the Exchequer. Subsequent Governments had to change policy on that also. While this fund is useful now and in the short-term, it is no substitute for the Government's responsibility for proper funding in all these areas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_618">Every Government has to make decisions on income and expenditure. It is not possible to spend what is not earned. The budget on all headings in my Department has increased by 5%. As the inflation rate is 2.3%, we are keeping ahead of inflation. Since most of the social and economic money from this fund is going to CLÁR and RAPID areas next year, there are significant increases in the CLÁR funding for next year. I have also set up a totally new RAPID fund of €4.5 million. Not only are we doing this within the dormant accounts fund, but we are also doing it within the Department's budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">During the year I promised I would focus on the areas of greatest disadvantage. For obvious political reasons we kept widening the pool covering area partnerships etc. According to the people who designed them, these are meant to be for the areas of great concentrations of social disadvantage. It was clear there was a need to pull it back into those areas by taking a number of steps. We made sure that part of the dormant account fund was ring-fenced for RAPID. We established the new RAPID fund of €4.5 million. I accept the rest of it – the current money – was there under another heading. There is a concentrated effort to significantly increase the funding, particularly for RAPID areas and also for CLÁR areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">The 5% increase includes the increase for wages under benchmarking and other pay related matters, which I understand to be 8% in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The real increase in the Department is not spectacularly high, as is the case across all Departments. The amount available to the Department for disbursal this year differs little from the figure for last year. This will frustrate the expectations of communities for direct Exchequer funding from the Department. Does the Minister accept that while this money is valuable in the short-term, it is not a replacement for ongoing policy to provide a proper level of funding in all of these areas through direct Exchequer support?</p>

          <p eId="para_621">Of course it is not. We must provide Exchequer funding. I accept absolutely that the level will be small. It is important that we secure additionality, both in regard to dormant accounts and also on the other side.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">My Department is lucky in regard to the benchmarking issue as I am not responsible for many staff intensive sub-bodies. A great deal of money goes to people on the ground. If the Deputy examines the Estimate for my Department, he will notice that the amount in the subhead for administration is down next year, despite benchmarking. There is no way he can say benchmarking is eating up my departmental funds. Because of this, there is a 6% increase in some of the major subheads under the community, rural and Gaeltacht headings. There is more than 5% in some due to the very tight ship we run on the administrative side where every possible saving is made. One will not find administration or benchmarking gobbling up the extra finances given to my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The principle of what the Deputy said is true. I hope that when he gets into government – which is unlikely – he will make sure that there will be additional funding.</p>

      <b>Mr. Crawford</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
      if he has satisfied himself that the community and rural structures are getting their fair share of Government funds in view of the very low investment in the BMW region compared to the southern and eastern region; his views on whether, as long as infrastructure is ignored in the BMW region, it would be difficult to attract and sustain industry and therefore employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [28695/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_625">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Rabbitte on 21 October regarding the concerns expressed about expenditure under the operational programme of the BMW regional assembly. I said then that the BMW regional assembly had pointed out that the €644 million shortfall was based on expenditure to date, relative to the original indicative forecasts set out in the regional operational programme in 2000. It is important to set this figure in context to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">There were a number of unavoidable delays in getting some measures up and running. These included the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001 which was followed by severe weather conditions which restricted progress in on-farm investment schemes while delays in State aid approvals affected tourism measures, waste management and some on-farm investment schemes. The broadband measure was hampered by difficulties in the IT sector. Administrative delays and tight budgetary conditions were responsible for limited delays in a number of areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">In contrast, several measures are performing very well. Local authority expenditure on non-national roads is ahead of target. Other measures performing well are county enterprise boards, fishery harbours infrastructure, Teagasc advisory services and the local development programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The fishery harbours measure includes both Gaeltacht and island harbour infrastructure. While the focus for fishery harbours generally is in respect of fishing catches and quotas, the overlying rationale for my Department's investment is mainly for the purpose of providing basic access to the islands in line with stated Government policy. While there have been delays in commencing some measures, it is still anticipated that these measures will spend their full allocation by 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">I understand much of the underspend money relates to projects which have been approved and are in progress across various measures but for which no funding had been paid out at the end of December 2002. I share these concerns about the underspend and while a number of the programmes do not come within my Department's remit, I will keep the issue under review during the remaining period of the NDP. The development of infrastructure is vital to balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Under the community development support programmes, my Department assists local self-help and community development initiatives targeted at disadvantaged communities in both rural and urban communities nationwide. In the BMW region a total of 56 community based projects are in receipt of funding. This includes six new projects which came on-stream with effect from September 2003, in line with my Department's ongoing commitment to the BMW region. The annual investment in the region under the community development support programmes comes to €6.4 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">Both the BMW and southern and eastern regions are covered by Gaeltacht schemes pertaining to strategic non-national roads, strategic piers and village renewal. Expenditure on strategic roads and village renewal is on target in both regions to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The CLÁR programme covers most of the BMW region. Of the 361,901 who live in CLÁR areas, 249,937 live in the BMW region. The only BMW counties not in the CLÁR programme are Laois and Offaly. The measures in the programme support physical, economic and social infrastructure in the targeted areas.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_633">Can the Minister honestly say he is safeguarding the needs of rural Ireland and community groups, in general? He referred to an increase in this year's budget for the CLÁR programme. The reality is that its budget has been decreased by €3.4 million since the election year. That is a fact. He has also increased the size of the area in which it operates. I want it increased further. I do not apologise for saying that some areas are included that should not be.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_635">The budget is down. The Minister referred to a sum of €644 million that had not been spent. The foot and mouth disease outbreak affected the entire country but it appears to have dramatically impacted on the amount being spent in the BMW area. Let us take as examples the N2 and N3, where thankfully the Carrickmacross bypass has started but there is no word whatsoever of the Castleblaney bypass.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_321">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_637">What is the Minister doing? I have letters written on behalf of 16 community development groups in Dublin, which I know he received. Their main problem is that he will not tell them if they can remain in existence. Where is the openness, transparency and accountability? They have received messages through the grapevine that the budget will be cut by 1%, 7% and 20%. They do not know what will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The Dóchas for Women group in Monaghan contacted me to find out what was happening to the Triskele group which the Minister met when he was in Carrickmacross. People do not know whether it can continue to exist and want to find out. The group has been told that funding may run out by February.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The Minister referred to the CLÁR programme—</p>

          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_640">I am sorry but this sounds like a Second Stage speech. The Deputy asked a number of questions of the Minister. Perhaps he will give him a chance to reply. There is a time limit on questions and I would not like it if no time was available for the Deputy to receive an answer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_323">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_641">I want to ask the Minister a straight question on CLÁR. He promoted a school playground facility when he was in Monaghan. The task of finding out how many suitable schools were located in the area was assigned to the Leader programme. That happened last July. Can this project hope to get funding?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_642">I have good news on that one. It will be rolling out very soon. The Deputy can go home and tell people he got good news from me today. The delay was due to some of the forms not being filled out correctly but we are going ahead with the ones that were.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I am a little surprised at the Deputy's question about the BMW region underspend. He then made a case for more funding for 16 groups in Dublin, in the southern and eastern region. I did not think Dublin had been transferred to the BMW region.</p>

          <p eId="para_648">Fine. The question seemed to be focused more on the BMW region. Therefore, let us focus on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">I fully accept that at half-time in this match we are a long way behind. I make no bones about this. We are a long way behind because of the reasons I outlined. We are also behind with some of the major projects and the major spend on roads. As I said time and again, the objective of Government has to be to fulfil the terms of the national development plan. This will place a huge obligation in the next three years on the likes of the NRA particularly to catch up and achieve the projected spend in the BMW region. I am a year in government as Minister with responsibility for the west, the BMW region and so on. As the Deputy knows, the planning of roads is a three to four year process. One cannot expect, therefore, to turn it around in six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I am committed to ensuring that the indicative figures in the Border, midlands and western region are achieved as far as possible under the various headings. If necessary, there will have to be adjustments among headings. We need the infrastructure. The Deputy can rest assured that my Department was established to ensure there was a Cabinet Member with responsibility across the areas involved who could constantly harp on these particular needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_658">Uaireanta déantar gearán fúm faoi seo. Is dóigh liom go n-úsáidim Gaeilge go rialta i dTithe an Oireachtais. Ní chuimhin liom ariamh labhairt ar an Dara Céim de Bhille nó ar ráiteas nó rud ar bith gan Ghaeilge a úsáid. Bainim úsáid as Gaeilge agus Béarla, agus molaim an bheirt Teachtaí a bhí liom aréir.

Maidir le díospóireacht sa Teach le linn Sheachtain na Gaeilge, ceann de na fadhbanna a bhíonn ann ná nach mbímid inár suí go hiondúil le linn sheachtain na Féile Pádraig. Bíonn aiféal orm, mar Aire, go mbím as baile go minic an tseachtain sin. Ba mhaith an smaoineamh é dá bhféadfaimis comhaontú a fháil sa Teach seo go mbeadh díospóireacht speisialta ar an Ghaeilge agus ar thábhacht na féiniúlachta sa tír seo go bliantúil an tseachtain roimh Lá Fhéile Pádraig. Iarraim ar an bPríomh-Aoire an cheist a thógáil leis na hAoirí eile ag cruinniú go luath – roimh an Nollaig – agus pleanáil a dhéanamh leo am a chur i leataobh le haghaidh díospóireachta mar sin sa Teach an tseachtain sin.

Ba mhaith liom rá freisin go bhfuil Ghaelainn á buanú anseo gach maidin Céadaoin, agus measaim go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge anseo ná mar a bhí, abair, trí nó ceithre bliana ó shin.</p>

Tá sé sin ráite agam go minic sa Teach seo. Nuair a bhíonn daoine ag caint mar gheall ar an Ghaelainn, go minic ní théann siad i ngleic leis an cheist. Ní théann siad isteach go doimhin sa scéal.

Impím ar an Aire, más féidir leis in aon chor, deontas ar leith a thabhairt do Sheachtain na Gaeilge i mbliana ionas go mbeidh muid in ann ceiliúradh ceart a dhéanamh ar an teanga, ach go háirithe toisc go bhfuil an Uachtaránacht againn.

D'fhéadfadh dul amú bheith orm faoi sin, ach tá sé sin ceart chomh fada agus is cuimhin liom. Tá mé cinnte gur thug mé ní ba mhó airgid dóibh. Maidir le hairgead breise, is é Foras na Gaeilge a dhéanann airgeadú ar Chonradh na Gaeilge, agus is le Conradh na Gaeilge Seachtain na Gaeilge ó thaobh chaitheamh airgid de. Tá méadú mór sa maoiniú a bheas ar fáil do Fhoras na Gaeilge don bhliain seo chugainn, agus is ceist don fhoras a shocrú an dtabharfaidh sé méadú do Sheachtain na Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Go ginearálta, tá mé ag éisteacht leis na moltaí atá ag teacht ó na Teachtaí, agus is féidir bheith cinnte go dtabharfaidh mé chuile thacaíocht ar féidir liom. Smaoinfidh mé air cad a dhéanamh go díreach leis an gConradh faoin rud a luaigh an Teachta Ó Snodaigh faoi bhealaí. Ní airgead a bheadh i gceist ach focal a rá le cuid de na húdaráis Stáit maidir le tacaíocht a thabhairt don tseachtain áirithe sin.

I gcás na Gaeltachta, áit a raibh tionscail déantúsaíochta thraidisiúnta mar bhonn lárnach don fhostaíocht ariamh anall, tá an tionchar sin níos feiceálaí fós.</p>

          <p eId="para_671">Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Aire, ach an rud a chuir díomá orm ná an ráiteas sin ar a raibh an Teachta O'Dowd ag caint ní ba luaithe. Tháinig sé ó chomhaltaí an údaráis. Deir siad go bhfuil €17.5 mhilliún níos lú acu i mbliana ná mar a bhí acu sa bhliain 2002. Tá sin ag cur boilscithe agus díol sócmhainní san áireamh. Tá sé ag dul sócmhainní a dhíol a thabharfaidh isteach €4 mhilliún.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">An bhliain seo caite cailleadh 1,432 phost agus cruthaíodh 910 bpost, cailliúnt 522 phost. Glacaim lena dúirt an tAire go bhfuil saghas eile forbortha ag teastáil, forbairt nua-aimseartha, leis an scéal seo a chasadh ach conas is féidir sin a dhéanamh nuair atá an méid sin airgid as an áireamh –€17.5 mhilliún idir 2002 agus 2004? Tá sin tubaisteach agus tá bórd Údarás na Gaeltachta an-bhuartha faoi seo, mar a dúradh sa ráiteas "D'aon Ghuth".</p>

          <p eId="para_673">Sa ráiteas céanna mhol an bord go haer an breisairgead atá ar do naonraí, naoiscoilleanna, seirbhísí don óige agus, go ginearálta, le haghaidh forbairt na Gaeilge sa nGaeltacht, tá sé sin sa línte deireanacha den ráiteas. Fáiltím roimh an bhfáilte ó bhord an údaráis.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">Seo croí na ceiste. Sa mbliain go bhfuil an Teachta ag rá go bhfuil gach rud ag dul i laige, cailleadh 522 phost. Taispeánann sin gur tháinig an toradh ar an rud a bhí mé ag rá le ceithre nó cúig bhliain siar nuair a thosaigh mé a rá leis an údarás go gcaithfeadh athrú threo a bheith ann agus gur cuma cé mhéad airgead a chaithfaí ar an seanbhealach, nach leigheasfaí fadhb na fostaíochta sa nGaeltacht ar an mbealach sin. Tá sin ráite agam sa Teach cheana féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Rud simplí a rinne muid, an Freasúra agus mise, le níos mó fostaíochta a chruthú sa nGaeltacht an samhradh seo ná a dhéanfadh go leor airgid ar foirgintí – achtú Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Ba cheart dúinn a chuimhniú an beart amháin sin nár chosnaigh aon airgead a chruthóidh níos mó postanna ná a chruthódh €10 milliún ar fhoirgintí. Tá €100 milliún caite ar fhoirgintí ó 1997 agus chonaic muid uilig an rud a tharla. Cén fáth? Mar tá an seanbhealach d'fhostaíocht a chruthú athraithe. Breathnaigh ar an athrú ar bhuiséad EI agus IDA. Tá sé ag dul isteach i bhforbairt agus taighde.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Maidir leis na figiúirí féin, ní theastaíonn sé uaim dhul siar ar an argóint sin. Ní chuirfeadh sin rudaí mar a chéile i gcomparáid. Mhínigh mé gur tugadh €3.5 mhilliúin sa bhreis don údarás ag deireadh na bliana seo caite. An ionann sin agus a rá dá mba rud é go dtabharfainn €1 mhilliún don údarás idir seo agus an Nollaig go mbeadh bealach ann go mbeinn ag laghdú Meastacháin na bliana seo chugainn? Níl aon chiall leis an gcineál sin caint agus tuigeann chuile duine sin ach tá toghchan ag teacht do na comhairlí condae agus tá brú ar pholaiteoirí.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">D'athraigh mé airgead thart go mór agus beidh orm tuilleadh de seo a dhéanamh, ach tá 6% breise ar fáil i mbliana agus níl mé ag dul a chaitheamh ar an seanbhealach. Tá mé ag dul é a chaitheamh ar an mbealach a chruthóidh fostaíocht, gníomhaíocht agus laidreas sa teanga sa nGaeltacht. Tá foinsí airgid nua ann – Science Foundation Ireland mar shampla, tá €200 milliún aige. Níl sé luaite go bhfuil an t-údarás ag dul ina dhiaidh sin ach tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé ag caint leis faoi níos mó ná €4 mhilliún.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Ag deireadh na bliana seo chugainn, feicfear an-torthaí as plean chomháite atá agam. Níl daoine ach ag breathnú ar phíosaí anseo agus ansiúd ach ag deireadh na bliana feicfear an-torthaí ar an bplean sin atá agamsa ar mhaithe le pobal na Gaeltachta agus ceanntair ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge láidir.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">Tá an t-airgead ann. Ní déarnadh iarracht i riamh sa nGaeltacht airgead pobail agus airgead príobháideach a tharraingt isteach ach amháin frid mhonarchana. Ag smaoineamh go simplí air seo, tá sé deacair airgead príobháideach a fháil isteach le bóthar a dhéanamh so caithfidh mé sin a dhéanamh 100% as airgead an Stáit. Tá sampla iontacha den smaoineamh nua seo ceadaithe ag an údarás gar don áit ina bhfuil mé féin i mo chónaí, agus tá sé ag mealladh airgid príobháidí isteach i ngnó na tógála. Ar an mbealach sin sabhálfaidh sé go leor airgead agus saorfaidh sé an t-airgead sin do bhóithre agus mar sin nach féidir le duine bheith ag súil go dtiocfadh airgead príobhaideach isteach.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Bhí NUIG ag caint ar ollchostas ar fhó-ionad a bhunú i nGaoth Dobhair ach ní raibh an méid sin airgid ar fáil. Smaoinigh an ollscoil arís agus chonaic sí go bhfuil monarchana folamha ar fud an eastáit i nGaoth Dobhair. Cén fáth nach rachadh sí i bpáirt leis an údarás ceann de na monarchana seo a thógáil, athchoiriú €1 mhilliún punt, seachas €10 milliún, a dhéanamh air agus bheadh sé chomh foirsteánach le háit nua, agus é a úsáid. An chéim amháin sin ag an údarás agus an ollscoil, ní amháin go bhfuil sé ciallmhar, stuama agus luach airgid, ach tá an rud sin ag tarraingt airgid isteach ón Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta tríd an Higher Education Authority isteach sa nGaeltacht, rud nach raibh ag tarlú cheana. Tá go leor foinsí airgid ann ach caithfimid iad a oibriú go stuama.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Bhí plé fada agam le cathaoirleach agus príobhfheidhmeannach an bhoird inniu air seo agus dúirt siad nach raibh brú airgid ar an údarás ar thaobh caipitil de i 2003 agus go raibh sé in ann na tógraí móra ar fad a tháinig a cheadú. Má tá duine ar bith ar lorg fianaise nach raibh brú ar an údarás, tairgaíodh €1.7 milliún ar áit sa Daingean nach bhfuil aon úsáid ann dó – bhí an t-airgead sin ar fáil – ach ní raibh aon ghá ar an údarás glacadh leis an tairscint agus ní bhac sé leis an áit a dhíol. Dá mbeadh brú airgid ar an údarás bheadh sé díolta.</p>

I must be sure that these bodies, some of whom get considerable sums of money from the Government, have proper accounting procedures, that there is openness and transparency about what happens to the money and that there are no whispering campaigns, true or otherwise, which will not be followed up. We are examining the matter as part of the review.

We immediately set in train steps to ensure that the matter would be fully investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">ADM handles partnerships. Therefore, if an issue concerning it is raised with me, the Department tells ADM to investigate it. A small amount of extra money was made available to ADM this year but, before any further moneys were given to keep breakfast clubs and such things going, I asked that those bodies in ADM which were overspending to carry out a thorough investigation of how they operated to ensure that unnecessary waste, etc. would be eliminated.</p>

          <p eId="para_712">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 35, 76, 78 and 85 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board published its first disbursement plan on 7 November 2003. The plan sets out the board's priorities for funding up to June 2005. It provides for the distribution of funds to assist programmes or projects targeting three broad categories of persons – those affected by economic and social disadvantage, those affected by educational disadvantage, and persons with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The plan provides for the distribution of funding annually between the three categories along the following lines. At least 40% of total funding will be allocated to economic and social disadvantage, at least 25% for educational disadvantage, and at least 25% for persons with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">One of the main features of the plan is the ring-fencing of a significant level of disbursements from the fund towards projects in those areas designated as suffering particular disadvantage. In this regard, the total allocation in the first year of the plan under the economic and social disadvantage heading will be for the purposes of assisting programmes or projects within RAPID, CLÁR and drugs task force areas. In subsequent years, those areas will receive not less than half the annual allocation under this heading. In addition, not less than half the annual allocations for the purpose of educational disadvantage will go towards programmes or projects within RAPID and drugs task force areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Another feature of the plan is the intention to ensure that funding for persons with a disability is prioritised towards those who require more intensive levels of support in the areas of health and personal social services. Older people are specified in the plan as one of the target areas for priority support. The plan also includes support for information technology as a measure to tackle disadvantage. Within this context, it is anticipated that projects to promote access to and competence in technology for older people will be supported from the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The board has engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. In this regard, an invitation to organisations, groups, etc. to make applications for funding under the scheme was advertised in the national press on Friday, 21 November. ADM will receive and assess applications for funding and make recommendations to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board for decision. At this stage, as I cannot predict the number of applications that are likely to be submitted, I am not in a position to specify how much will be paid out of the fund prior to the end of 2003. With regard to spending from the fund in 2004, consistent with advice from the Department of Finance, the board has agreed to disburse a figure not in excess of €30 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I strongly refute the suggestion from one of the Deputies that dormant accounts moneys will be used to compensate for cutbacks in other areas of the Department. In this context, it should be noted that subhead L in my Department's Vote for 2004 provides €42.2 million for local development and social inclusion measures. While the amount provided this year was €44.662 million, it should be noted that the provision in 2003 included a budget of €1.5 million to support the implementation of the RAPID programme. Therefore, the real reduction in subhead L next year is 2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">With regard to the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003, the position is that the Act provides for similar arrangements for unclaimed life assurance policies as apply to dormant accounts in banks, building societies and An Post. The Act requires insurance undertakings to take steps to identify and contact the owners of the unclaimed policies. If the owners cannot be traced, then the proceeds of the policies will be transferred to the dormant accounts fund and surplus funds disbursed by the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board for the purposes of community and societal benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The Act provides that the transfer of moneys by insurance undertakings from unclaimed life assurance policies to the dormant accounts fund will take place at the end of April each year, beginning in April 2004. At this stage, the yield to the fund from life assurance policies is unknown and will only become clear following the first transfer of funds next year.</p>

Is he willing to admit that he had €54 million in the same section in the election year of 2002? There was a reduction of 17% last year and a further cut of 2% this year at a time when wage increases and other matters have to be taken into account. Do we have a separate budget for the dormant accounts? Where can we clarify how much will be available from it? I am sorry for mixing up the position in Dublin with that in the BMW region.

Will he ensure they will be given sufficient funding? Does he realise that such groups are given very small funds? Voluntary groups can deliver enormous benefits to the underprivileged. I encouraged the Minister to examine the structures in order to find waste. I do not believe the voluntary groups which give the best service to those in need should be deprived of funds.

This matter was not the subject of the original question which related to dormant accounts. My memory is that there was an increase after the election. I gave them more money at a time when the Deputy and others were hopping up and down and talking about cutbacks. If one is to refer to 2002 figures, one should examine the Estimate figure at the beginning of the year, not the outturn figure. In my Department, which is very good with money, the outturn figure often includes money given at the back end. If money is saved in one area, one may allocate it to an area where there has been an overspend. It is a valid way to operate. One should not pretend that the money allocated in December 2002 was somehow miraculously allocated before the election in May that year. The truth should always be respected in these matters.

          <p eId="para_743">The Minister has indicated that the moneys accruing from unclaimed life assurance policies will be paid over, after all the procedures have been followed, at the end of April each year. This process will start at the end of April 2004. The Minister has said it is impossible to calculate or make an educated guess about how much money is involved but surely he can give some kind of ball-park indicator of what might be available. I would like to ask him about the issue of delivery which comes across to me as we debate these issues. Who does what? I reiterate the point I made that two years' work by the RAPID groups in local areas is being ignored. The Minister has given positive indications in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">My basic question relates to achieving improved coherence across local and community development structures. While there have been indications, when will we hear something definite from the Minister in that regard? Like Deputy Crawford, I have received representations from the support group framework in my local area on behalf of CDSPs. Many are concerned because there is a lack of certainty. It is extremely important, in the interests of service delivery and continuity, that people know what is coming down the line. We have waited for a long time for the Minister's proposals which will follow the consultation process. Everyone involved in this sector needs to know when we will find out what the Minister intends to do.</p>

          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_745">I agree with the Deputy about the issue of coherence. I have said before that I will take it on board but I am not sure of the amount of money. We have fixed the figure of €30 million per year. There is a temptation to go on a big splurge because there is a few hundred million in the fund. It is intended that the fund will last at least ten years which is a conservative estimate. We will not blow it all. Deputies would a have right to be critical if we had decided to allocate €70 million or €90 million per year, thereby spending all of the money quickly on some kind of over-capacity job. Members will know the kinds of problems that we have seen before when that was done. I am therefore supportive of a "steady as she goes" approach and spreading the money out over a long period. Money is a valuable resource and we should use it carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Regarding CDSPs, we will grant three year contracts again. Last year, they only had one year contracts. I wanted to bring them into line with the national development plan on a three year basis. We will give three year contracts and the CDSPs will continue. I hope to bring my proposals to Government soon. We are working hard on them and are well advanced in preparing the proposals. However, I also want to ensure that they are sensible, practical, flexible and make a difference in delivery to the people whom we all try to serve.</p>

          <p eId="para_753">The question I wanted to ask the Minister related to his reference to comparisons between outturns and the next year's Estimates. That is a total negation of how the Estimates themselves are presented. The 5% figure the Minister quoted as a reward for his Department's activities is a comparison with last year's Estimate figure rather than last year's outturn figures.</p>

          <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_754">I will explain that. In the preliminary volume that is published before the budget, the comparison is between the previous year's Estimate and that for the next year. Then, when the full volume is published in February of the following year, the comparison is different, being, for example, between the 2004 Estimate and the expected outturn for 2003. The comparative figures that we use in the two Estimates volumes are not the same. The Deputy will become more familiar with this process the longer he is a Member. If he takes the figures in the 2002 Estimates, 2003 preliminary Estimates, and final full Estimates in February, he will find different figures, one giving the Estimates figure and the other the outturn figure. They are not the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Perhaps I might also clarify the savings. It will happen again in my Department this year that under some heading there will be an underspend. For example, in islands, we had expected to begin work on some piers and, through no fault of my Department or my officials, it did not happen. We had also hoped to do work on the cable car to Inis Bigil, but that did not happen either. I cannot control such matters. However, within reason, where there is an underspend on one heading, one is allowed to transfer the money to other headings. One tries to ensure that at the end of the year one does not go beyond one's Vote and that one spends as much of it as possible.</p>

If one has a Supplementary Estimate in the course of the year, which may happen, the increase in the next year's Estimates would be far smaller than what is being promoted in the annual Book of Estimates. There is a need for greater clarity and honesty in how we present those Estimates since it is obviously an attempt to confuse and befuddle.</p>

          <p eId="para_761">No, it is not. What has happened over the past week or two is simple. The bottom-line figure does not change unless one gets a Supplementary Estimate. However, it can happen, as it did in the case of both ADM and Údarás na Gaeltachta in 2003, that there is an underspend under other headings within my Department's Vote, especially in Waterways Ireland, due to no fault of my Department but because of other circumstances that are relevant today. The agency received a bonus coming up to Christmas. It had matured liabilities which we paid them for. To compare that outturn for an organisation that gets over and above what had been intended for it in the Estimates with the following year's Estimate and then not to say equally that an underspend in one year results in a huge increase the following year is disingenuous.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">If, when we get the outturn figures, the Deputy says that there has been a massive increase in the budgets of underspending Departments and a decrease in those of Departments whom we allowed to overspend by giving them extra money, that is fine, but if one is consistent, one cannot take one without the other. I will go through these figures line by line during any Estimates debate and show the Deputy how one must be consistent, so that, if there is an underspend in one Department, one must give credit and if there is an overspend in another, one must also examine that.</p>

          <p eId="para_765">Regarding 2002 to 2004, unfortunately I must repeat myself again. If one compares the 2002 Estimate – my memory is that it was something like €47 million – one must take the €1.5 million that we have now transferred out of that Vote and into a new one for RAPID, and one will see that there has not been the decrease that Deputy Crawford said there was.</p>

Let us suppose that the current Estimates volume says that I am granting an 18% increase for islands next year compared with this year's Estimates. Supposing that, up to Christmas, they had matured liabilities and I had savings and I gave another €10 million to islands, would the Deputy in his heart of hearts believe that the end-of-year extra spend would suddenly mean that the Estimate for the following year was a decrease? No he would not. He would say that the base Estimate shows an increase over the Estimate. One must take either outturn versus outturn or Estimates versus Estimates. Some Estimates will not be the same as the outturn at the end of the next year. One must take either Estimate versus Estimate or outturn versus outturn.

        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_412">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_773">As I said before the suspension of the debate, I was anxious for the Tánaiste to make sense of the fact that reductions in premia arising from fewer cases being taken, fewer fraudulent cases and more moderate awards do not seem to be translating into lower premia for employers' liability cover in the business community.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">This is particularly the case when the excesses which apply in regard to liability insurance are far higher than in motor cases and there is such a significant level of self-insurance by companies. I would be horrified to think there might be manipulation of business insurance losses to keep maximum pressure on politicians, given the impact of high insurance costs on employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">A major problem with insurance in Ireland is the lack of competition in the marketplace. That we have so few general insurance firms providing competition for consumers is the fundamental problem. I am concerned that the existing players in the marketplace might well be contented by the continued absence of competition. It suits them well. Attempts to make the marketplace more attractive are unlikely to be met with universal approval from them. It is for this reason that they must be compelled to make the new reforms work. In the absence of such compulsion the insurance industry must give firm guarantees of reductions, rather than equivocal and mealy-mouthed statements suggesting that they might not be able to pass on any savings made.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">On the issue of competition, I was recently alarmed to hear that the general liability business of Eagle Star might be transferred to one of the existing players in the marketplace. I have also been alarmed by attempts by some of the insurers to cynically use the penalty points system as a means of refusing to provide cover. The Tánaiste and the Competition Authority must vigorously pursue any companies which try to restrict competition. It is regrettable that the authority has been so slow and tardy in the completion of its study of competition in the insurance sector. With its considerable powers to search and seize documents and request information, it could have played a meaningful role in getting to the bottom of the insurance crisis. However, it now looks like its report will be available long after the problem has been fixed, if the insurance reforms are implemented and the Tánaiste's objectives are fulfilled. Delay seems to be a persistent problem with the authority, one which the Tánaiste will need to address at some stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">I broadly welcome the Bill's provisions. However, I note the debate in the Seanad, particularly the concerns raised by Senators from all sides of the House about aspects of the provisions. It seems the Tánaiste has made up her mind in regard to this legislation and is not willing to accept amendments that have not received the <i>imprimatur</i> of the interim PIAB. It is the Houses of the Oireachtas, not the interim board of the PIAB, that make the law in this State. I hope that in the debate in this House the Tánaiste's mind will be more open to genuine concerns and comments made by Members from all sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">In the debate in the Seanad two key points emerged which received all-party support, including from Fianna Fáil. The first concerns the issue of representation. The Tánaiste seems unable or unwilling to allow people to be represented by solicitors in their dealings with the PIAB. She argues that legal representation is not necessary in dealings before the PIAB because there are no legal issues being considered. She also told the Seanad which the Minister of State has repeated today that, if a person chose to instruct a solicitor to act as his or her agent in dealings with the PIAB, the board would ignore this instruction and continue to deal directly with the claimant.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The Tánaiste needs to be careful. If she allows the impression to be created and sustained that the PIAB is unfair and lacks balance in dealing with claimants, the PIAB will not work. Insurance companies, in their dealings with the PIAB, will have the full resources of actuarial, legal, medical and engineering advisers available to them when assessing which cases it will deal with under the PIAB. Claimants will have no such support. If a person decides to instruct a solicitor to represent him or her in his or her dealings with the PIAB at his or her own expense, it seems churlish, petty and suspicious for the PIAB to ignore that instruction.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Not everyone is as skilled, equipped or talented in dealing with official bodies as the Minister of State. If people require representation in their dealings with the PIAB, it should be facilitated. It is also ridiculous for the Tánaiste to suggest that the PIAB will not be dealing with the legal issues and that solicitors will have no role to play for claimants in dealing directly with the PIAB. I can think of a number of legal issues with which the PIAB will be dealing, including establishing the identity of the respondent, determining the level of contributory negligence involved, assessing whether a claimant is vulnerable and making an assessment of a person's legal entitlement to redress and compensation, presumably in accordance with the legal principles handed down by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The PIAB will also have to act within the law in the manner in which it respects the rights of individuals. If claimants wish to be represented in their dealings with the PIAB and pay the cost of representation themselves, without adding any burden of costs, the PIAB should recognise this fact. I gather this is a point that has found favour with a number of the Tánaiste's colleagues, including the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, and some Fianna Fáil colleagues in their discussions at constituency level. It may be somewhat different from what happens in Dublin. It has also received cross-party support in the Seanad. I want the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who represents the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party well at times, to take these views on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">The second major issue which concerns me about the PIAB is the issue of liability. The PIAB has been sold to the public and politicians on the basis that it will deal with cases where liability is not an issue. The debate In the Seanad confirms that this is a complete hoax. Under the Bill, as presented, an insurer can compel a claimant to go to the PIAB. The claimant can wait for up to 15 months for the PIAB to reach an assessment of the case. If, at the end of that process, the insurer does not like the assessment reached, the claimant can be forced to start again with a full set of proceedings in the courts. In those subsequent proceedings the insurer will be perfectly entitled to deny liability and fully fight the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">In the light of this, the Tánaiste should stop trying to fool people that the PIAB will deal with cases where liability is not an issue. It will only deal with cases where liability is not an issue for as long as the insurer determines it is not an issue. However, if the insurer does not like the result produced by the PIAB, the claimant faces a full legal case in the courts on the issue of liability and the extent of any damages claimed and will have to do so on the basis that there will have been no order for protection of the site involved, no order covering the material damage associated with the claimant in respect of the machinery or site involved until such time as the case can be dealt with in the courts. The claimant will be at a disadvantage if any effort is made in the meantime, during the 15 month period, to ensure the site is tampered with or machinery where, for example, an accident occurred is interfered with.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I am not alone in my concerns in this regard. I note that speakers from all parties in the Seanad had similar concerns. In particular, I noted the comment by Senator Maurice Hayes, former Ombudsman in Northern Ireland and Chairman of the National Forum on Europe, who stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_785">I worry about the possibility that an insurance company might string the matter along, allow the complainant to produce whatever he or she needs to produce and then say "hard luck, we must start again in the courts". This is something which must be avoided either by way of rule of the organisation or rule of procedures, if not by statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">As I understand the Tánaiste's position on the Bill, she has no intention of avoiding this situation but again places her belief in the promise of good behaviour from the insurance sector. She also argued in the Seanad that it was ludicrous to suggest insurers would ignore an assessment made by the PIAB in an individual case and then take the case to the courts, given that they would be paying for the PIAB. I am afraid this contention does not stand up.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I have no doubt lawyers carry a fair share of the blame for the manner in which the courts system operated, one aspect of the problem of high insurance costs. However, insurers carry an equal element of culpability. The Tánaiste talks regularly of claimants in Ireland having to wait six times longer than in the United Kingdom to receive compensation. While this is no doubt attributable to opportunistic lawyers, greedy plaintiffs and inefficient court procedures, insurers must also bear some share of the responsibility. I am personally aware of many cases where insurers entered a full defence in a case where liability should not have been at issue. Furthermore, many cases are settled at the door of the court which insurers could have settled at an earlier stage of the proceedings. However, there was no incentive for them to do so, given that they have the ultimate discretion of raising premiums to pay for their inefficiencies. The latter is contributing to the lack of competitiveness and higher than usual premiums being charged to customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">The manner in which many insurers dealt with the court process, refusing to settle at an early stage and stringing claimants along until they reach the doors of the court, does not inspire confidence in terms of changing their approach in dealing with claims before the PIAB. The simple, sad fact the Tánaiste has yet to learn is that insurers will not willingly pass on reductions in premiums unless there is some element of compulsion involved. For this reason, they should not be allowed to contest liability in subsequent court proceedings if they reject an assessment issued by the PIAB. It would perpetuate an extreme injustice on claimants if insurance companies were able to convey the impression, through involvement with the PIAB, that liability was not at issue in a case and then had the freedom to reject an assessment reached by the PIAB and, 15 months later, contest liability. That is a real cause for concern and is a case of having one's cake and eating it.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Unless the Tánaiste addresses this matter in the Bill, she will create major difficulties for the assessment board, businesses and consumers. Insurers will operate the system to suit themselves, not the public. The Tánaiste needs to stop looking at insurers through the rose-tinted glasses provided by the insurance sector and claims managers. I hope she will take account of the points we are making. She needs to face reality in terms of the way she deals with this issue and start to exert pressure to insurers. She must realise that the success of the PIAB will not be down to claimants but more likely will depend on the response of the insurance industry to the initiative. The record to date does not fill me with confidence. The ultimate success or otherwise of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will depend on whether customers receive lower insurance premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">In 1986 there was a great deal of discussion about the abolition of juries from court cases involving compensation claims. The insurance companies promoted such an abolition to the Oireachtas by claiming that they could reduce premia substantially if legislation were enacted. The former Minister, Deputy Howlin, will be aware that the abolition of juries from such cases and the increase in the number of senior and junior barristers who became involved in cases led to the cost of litigation doubling rather than, as originally intended, being reduced by half. That is the background to issues relating to the compensation of people in the event of their making claims. The abolition of juries led to higher rather than lower insurance premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board will be successful if it merely assesses claims and does not become either another layer of bureaucracy or another form of court. It should primarily be established for the purpose of dealing with liability claims initially. I do not believe that we should rush into assessing road traffic accidents or personal injury through any form other than employers' liability until we see that the new system is working well.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Section 56 deals with the composition of the board. The members of the board are already adequately versed in dealing with employers' liability claims. However, when the board proceeds to deal with claims involving personal injury or road traffic accidents, will it be necessary to change the members in order that it will have the relevant expertise available to it to deal with such claims? I would like this issue to be explored further.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">As already stated, I am concerned about section 16 and the fundamental issue in law with which it deals. Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights explicitly lays down the right of people to seek redress through the courts in a particular jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Section 7 penalises claimants for taking advice by not giving them time to draw up documents or allowing them to obtain whatever advice, whether it be legal, medical or engineering, they may need. They are obliged to serve documents, not just an application form, to the assessment board, but they will have to support it by resorting to the expertise of members of the various professions. They are obliged to pay for such expertise themselves. Insurance companies will pay for whatever expert advice they need but they can pass on that cost in the form of higher insurance premiums to their customers. Respondents and claimants will not have access to the same level of advice. Section 7 should not be a penalty to claimants. Has the Tánaiste obtained legal advice, particularly in respect of constitutional issues, regarding the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European Court of Human Rights?</p>
          <p eId="para_795">Section 11 deals with the making of applications. As public representatives, we do not want to end up, as we do regularly in other instances, giving people advice in respect of assessment application forms. I hope the helpline will be of assistance to people but I suspect that claimants will seek professional advice rather than relying on that offered by those manning the helpline.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">With regard to sections 20 to 22, there is no guarantee that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will remove cases from the court system. The book of quantum will be made up of settlements apart from court awards. Many settlements are made on the steps of courthouses and, subsequently, the claims are struck off the High Court list. As a result, no one knows the result of such claims. For one reason or another, people like claims to be settled because they do not want to take the stand in courts. We cannot obtain the full details of such settlements and this will affect the accuracy of the book of quantum.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">We are being asked to pass this legislation without knowing the rules and regulations attaching to the workings of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Section 46 refers to the introduction of rules. The Tánaiste should outline, on Committee Stage, exactly what those rules will be before we approve the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Section 50 deals with the time limits attaching to the deliberations of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in respect of claims. In my view, those limits are somewhat generous and should be reduced rather than extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board represents a major reform in the manner in which compensation claims will be paid. It is a new structure and has the objective of reducing the cost of litigation for respondents and insurance companies. The ultimate objective is a reduction in the cost of insurance premia. We will not be able to adjudicate on the success or otherwise of this scheme until employers' liability is dealt with effectively by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Only then will the board be able to extend its influence into other areas. We will ultimately be judged on whether the board has a major impact on reducing the costs of litigation which, in turn, would help reduce the cost of insurance premia to ordinary individuals and the business community.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">As stated earlier, I support the Bill in principle. I look forward to Committee Stage on which we will be able to tease out the various sections and be provided with additional information. I hope the Tánaiste will be in a position to ensure that ordinary claimants do not lose out and insurance companies benefit. Balance is required for everybody involved in the process, not least those who will submit claims to the board.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_413">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_801">I join my Fine Gael colleague in welcoming the Bill, which is an extremely important element of the range of issues that must be addressed if we are to tackle the high cost of insurance. I will obviously have an opportunity during my contribution to outline a more broad attitude to the Bill, but I wish to state that the Labour Party will be supporting it on Second Stage. We will do so for one reason, namely, that we are convinced a range of measures is required in order to bring about a fundamental change in the insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The cost of insurance is an extraordinary barrier to business. Members of the House will have attended public meetings throughout the country and will have talked to businessmen and women who have struggled to keep their businesses afloat, not because of the intrinsic profitability of those businesses but because of the unpredictability of the rises with which they are faced, monthly and yearly, in their insurance premiums. It is a barrier to the maintenance of business, the expansion of employment and the mobility of the individual. Those who depend on cars to travel because of our inadequate public transport system find they are unable to afford insurance. This is particularly the case for young drivers. A consensus has been building for years that action is required. Finally, we have a concrete example of action in the form of this legislation, the first in a series of actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The Minister of State thanked his former colleague, Dessie O'Malley, for his involvement in the preparation of the legislation. With respect to this former senior politician, it is a long time since he held office. Credit was also given to my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, a former Minister of State in the Department, because this Bill was drafted while he was in office a number of years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The Bill has had a long gestation and, in the meantime, businesses and citizens have paid through the nose for insurance and have found it impossible to obtain affordable insurance. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am a member, could not accurately quantify the number of jobs lost because of the high cost of insurance. It is second only to wages as the most significant cost faced by businesses and this burden has sent many under.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Earlier this week I had recourse to the Insurance Industry Federation to obtain insurance for a small company employing four people in my constituency. The company contacted seven different insurance companies and brokers. Six would not quote the company and the other quote was not affordable in terms of maintaining the viability of the business. That is the backdrop to the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Effective work has been done by two groups in this regard. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board produced a valuable report outlining in detail a serious of concrete proposals, which all interests should be required to implement. In addition, I refer to the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, ably chaired by Deputy Cassidy. He has driven insurance reform to the top of our priority list. He initiated a series of public hearings, which meant the committee was in session until the early weeks of August before producing an interim report that outlined 40 proposals, one of which was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory basis. It would be wrong of the House or the public to look on the establishment of the PIAB, following the enactment of the legislation, as a solitary measure to substantially reduce insurance costs. The setting up the board is part of a coherent strategy, which must be put in place if the insurance industry is to be radically reformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The joint committee is convinced the PIAB is an important part of the overall solution. The board is a clearing house for cases where liability is not contested. The objective is to award proper and appropriate compensation to persons who suffer personal injuries and who sue others for liability as fairly and efficiently as possible. The board is purported to be a clearing house for cases in which liability is not an issue and where it is in a position to award proper and appropriate compensation. A process that has become extremely cumbersome and slow over many years is being fundamentally streamlined but, in doing so, injured parties must not be treated unfairly. The Oireachtas needs to underscore that issue in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">Those who have recourse to the PIAB must do so in the confidence that they will be treated fairly and their award will be proper and appropriate. Justice must be seen to be done from the outset. I have had discussions with a vast array of interested parties. Few Bills have generated as much lobbying of Members as this Bill because there are many vested interests, some of whom will be adversely affected and I am conscious of that. However, while people may have a vested interest, that does not mean what they say should be discounted.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Many people, including Ministers, have commented during the preparation of the legislation that its purpose is the creation of "a lawyer free zone". There is concern at legal and other professional costs. It was difficult for the joint committee to get a handle on them but most of us were convinced that 42% of the cost of a claim is attributable to lawyers and other professionals. That burden is carried by those who pay the insurance premium and this must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">However, in attacking those whom we believe are exploiting the system or gaining too much from the system, it is critical that we are clear regarding our intention, which is the establishment of a fast, fair compensation system with a minimum of fuss that protects everybody's rights and, as far as is practicable, uses a standardised reference point, normally referred to as a book of quantum for injuries suffered. The system must not trample on people's rights if they feel aggrieved by this process so that they have recourse to the courts, as is their constitutional right. This process must be consistent throughout the State so that the compensation an individual receives is not determined by a specific judge who is perceived to be claimant friendly or another who is perceived to be unsympathetic to claimants. The establishment of a book of quantum for that purpose will, in my view, be an important part of this whole process. Every case will be unique and the PIAB, once established, will have to have regard to the specific circumstances of every case on which it deliberates. It is hoped to have the board established on a statutory basis from next January, dealing initially with employers' liability claims and, shortly thereafter – within six months or so – dealing with public liability and motor accident cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I have listened, with some sympathy, to the point made by Deputy Hogan about ensuring we do not rush our fences or simply broaden the scope of the work of the PIAB for the sake of "notching off" certain matters, as it were. He suggested we should wait until we are certain the board is in a position to deal fairly with those new types of cases before we consider expansion. That is a point well made and worth considering.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Those of us in the House who are dealing with this Bill have received submissions from a range of groups, including the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society. The latter body, through its various branches and individual members, has reinforced its case. I believe none of us is unimpressed by the society's ability to lobby as it does. The fact that the profession has a vested interest should not preclude us from giving its submissions the consideration they deserve, as I have tried to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">The principle of establishing the PIAB is not a matter for disagreement in this House, as far as I am aware. It is certainly the case that all parties involved in the discussion and detailed analysis of the plight of people seeking insurance in the Irish market have agreed that, in principle, the establishment of the PIAB is a key part of the solution to providing affordable insurance. Accordingly, the issue is not about the principle of establishing the PIAB but, rather, the detail and form of the board. While the specifics will be best teased out on Committee Stage, rather than under the time constraints of Second Stage, in welcoming the broad principles, I wish to alert the Minister of State to some of my concerns and to indicate my views and those of the Labour Party with regard to this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">The scope of the Bill, in legal terms, should be clear rather than general. I will propose amendments on Committee Stage which I hope will assist the objective of clarity as to the steps to be taken, the timeframes involved, the expectations of claimants and the rights of all parties in this process. There is need for some changes in order to bring about that reassurance. I draw the attention of the Minister of State and, through him, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to the fact that the provisions of this Bill will fall or succeed on the basis of how it is perceived by the various parties who will use it in future, including claimants, their advisers and respondents.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">No matter how well we craft this legislation, it will not succeed if the perception goes abroad that it is unfair or that claimants will be treated in an unfair way. Not only have we a duty to make the process as effective, simple and efficient as possible, we also have ensure that it is perceived as fair and transparent. For that reason, I join Deputy Hogan in a genuine expectation and hope that the Minister or Minister of State who takes the Committee Stage will be open to accepting amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">It was very disappointing that the Bill should go through the other House without any amendment being accepted, even though I understand there was a consensus on a number of issues. That is not the way to deal with an issue such as this which has been a long time in gestation, as it were, having come to the House through a process of consensus via the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. If there is some tweaking required, Ministers should be open to hearing the arguments, rather than believing their first draft is so perfect that it is not capable of improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I wish to refer to some particular sections of the Bill, as Deputy Hogan did in his contribution. In section 11, which covers applications to the board for assessment, I wish to ensure that claimants are only required to furnish medical reports on which they intend to rely, as would be the case in court proceedings. The Minister of State referred to this and I am aware that the issue was raised in the other House. I am not convinced by his presentation in that regard. I believe it is possible for the board to have independent medical examination and evidence. However, I do not believe there should be a legal requirement on a claimant to furnish documentation on which he or she does not intend to submit evidence and which is not part of the claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">With regard to section 13, there should be a specific timeframe for notification of respondents of claims, to ensure speedy action. The current phrase in the section, "as soon as is practicable", is patently unspecific and far too vague. We should lay out, in concrete terms, the timeframe for the operation of this process if the objectives are speed and efficiency, linked always to fairness. Like Deputy Hogan and many speakers in the other House, I have a genuine difficulty with sections 14 and 16, which deal with the issue of accepting liability. The role of the PIAB is to provide a clearing house for non-contested liability cases, where the only matters to be determined are the degree of injury and the extent of compensation which should accrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The process is most important. Having considered this issue at some length, my original thoughts on the matter were the same as those the Minister of State outlined in his introduction to this debate. In the PIAB process, if either party is not content with its findings, they can bring the matter to court, with a blank sheet in the sense that there are no consequences from what has taken place previously. I believed that was a fair position, which I also had accepted. However, practitioners in this field have made the case that this can result in an injustice and we must have regard to that view.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">If we believe there might be an injustice, bearing in mind that one injustice arising early in the process could kill off the process, we need to ensure this matter is not simply swept aside, as the Minister of State indicated his intention of doing. As the Bill is currently drafted, an insurance company is not required to come swiftly to grips with a claim by deciding, from the beginning, whether to accept liability. They can simply keep their powder dry, let the process run and at the end of it fight it in the courts and contest liability. On the face of it, is that a bad thing? It is, if one is the claimant and one's chance to capture all the evidence supporting one's claim has disappeared in the 15 to 17 months that have elapsed during which one was led to believe that liability was not an issue. When a person seeks to capture evidence to support liability, he or she might find that the person who had worked with him or her has changed employment or that the physical evidence he or she needs to prove liability – be it the chair that collapsed, the piece of machinery involved or the shield that was broken – is no longer there, which leaves the person at a major disadvantage. If people perceive that will be the norm, or if they get advice from their union representative or from anybody else that such will be the norm, they will be reluctant to accept the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. We must have regard to that issue. I will seek to table suitable amendments to the relevant sections on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will be open to accepting what I propose.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">Even if he is convinced that the blank sheet option is the better one, the perception of the operation of the board will be critical to its success. If the perception goes abroad that this is an unfair system that disadvantages claimants, and there are many vested interests who would like that perception to go abroad, the board and this initiative will be a failure. Therefore, this is an important issue for us to get right in our deliberations. This measure is but one of the many actions that need to be taken, but it is an important one.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The issue of legal representation in this lawyer free zone is not something about which we can be absolute. I understand that the Minister's Department has begun to prepare a user friendly guide to the operation of the PIAB, of which I was given an early draft. Such a user friendly guide will be given to a person who might be injured and who might not be used to reading, much less filling in, forms. I read it only once but did not find it the most user friendly guide I have ever read. It clearly underscores this mechanism is not simple or straightforward. I believe most people will feel they require advice on this process. Should a person wish to seek the advice of a solicitor, he or she should not be debarred from doing that. The Minister is not suggesting that the person concerned should be debarred from doing so, but there should be a compulsion on the PIAB to communicate with the solicitor involved and not simply take such a solicitor out of the equation, as the Bill currently proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">We must make this mechanism as user friendly as we can. We must build in the necessary assurances – I readily accept that we do not want to demolish the board as an effective entity by loading in lawyers and advisers – to ensure we do not achieve the objective of cheaper assurance at the cost of disadvantaging claimants who are given less compensation than that to which they are entitled and less than what is fair and proper. I make that point strongly and I will seek by way of amendment on Committee Stage to make it even stronger.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">We have gone into all the other measures that are required to deal with the issue of what was described by some who came before the Oireachtas committee as a dysfunctional insurance market. I hope the example of the introduction of this legislation will be matched by the zeal with which the Department pushes all the other reform mechanisms, the 40 the committee has listed, and that we will have advances on all fronts on this matter. I agree with others who said that we must concretise our objectives in this regard. It is not good enough simply to say these are the reforms we will bring about without knowing, in specific terms, what is the objective in providing reduced premia to policy holders. Since many of these reforms are requests from the insurance industry, there should be a specific commitment from that industry in terms of its response so that it is not simply clawing in profits to more than compensate for the losses it has incurred in a few bad years.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">I believe this measure will have the desired result of reducing the cost of insurance and providing for the fair treatment of all, if the amendments that will be proposed are accepted and the issues being addressed by the Opposition are properly taken on board by the Government. However, this proposal will have to be carefully monitored. It may not achieve its objective, which is a possibility bearing in mind that Deputy Hogan instanced promises made in the past when we were advised if we no longer had juries and reduced the number of senior counsel there would be a dramatic impact on the cost of insurance, none of which came to pass. We need to specifically monitor this mechanism and make sure it achieves the objectives that this House sets for it. If it does not, we should be willing to review the legislation in a year's time and make what changes are deemed appropriate and necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The Oireachtas committee is determined to bring about change. We are determined to ensure that all participants play their part in this task. The first set of submissions on insurance costs that we, as an Oireachtas committee, received is encouraging. Other measures, particularly the introduction of penalty points, seem to have been an extremely important contributor in reducing the number of motor accidents and fatalities. If we are to accept the base figures given to us by a number of insurance companies, there has already been a quantifiable reduction in insurance premia, not only in motor insurance but across the insurance market. However, many companies and individuals have seen little evidence of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">While we are bringing about this array of change and while the Labour Party will support and assist in transforming the insurance market in a fair and balanced way, we must have at the end of this debate a clearly stated objective. The Oireachtas committee and its chairperson have stated that our objective in the medium term is to ensure insurance premia are reduced by 30%. I would ask the Minister and the Minister of State to set out their objectives, the monitoring procedure that will apply and the timeframe involved so that we can not only say we are changing the law but grasping this issue and setting out a timeframe for quantifiable and real results that will benefit insurance premia payers across the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">The Green Party also supports the Bill. It welcomes it arrival and, hopefully, safe passage through the Oireachtas. It is unfortunate that the senior Minister is not present to engage in the debate. I do not in any way wish to belittle the contribution of the Minister of State in that regard. This is the second day I have contributed to a Second Stage debate on major legislation in respect of which the relevant Minister has not been present. There may be good reasons for that in terms of the timing of European Council meetings or whatever, but it is unfortunate. The Whips need to examine if we arranging business in such a manner as to ensure that Ministers, putting through important legislation such as this, are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">From comments made to the media by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, she seems to be clearing her desk at the moment. However, she also implied that the passage of this Bill was of particular concern to her. It is strange, though, that she is not here on Second Stage. I hope on Committee Stage she will show more flexibility towards amendments because, even though the Green Party supports the Bill, it needs amending.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">One issue the Minister must bring out of her filing cabinet before she departs is her role in ensuring that competition exists in enterprise and business so that consumers are getting the best value and not suffering cosy cartels across a range of activities. There is concern, given the small number of players in the insurance industry, that our efforts to reduce insurance costs through legislation will be in vain. In essence, we are dealing with a market that is comfortable, setting premia based on nice market conditions rather than tight, competitive ones. While we are examining the reduction of legal costs in insurance, the Minister needs to be equally strident in enforcing competition. I hope in the remaining months of her ministerial position she addresses that issue with equal vigour.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Many believe that legal and other professional costs are inflating Irish insurance premia above any other international comparison. I believe that to be the case and it is appropriate that the Bill reduces those costs. The central tenet of the Bill is to reduce legal and professional costs in insurance claims. However, despite Oireachtas committees having looked at this issue extensively, as well as the MIAB, and discovering that 40% of costs are taken up by the legal and professional sector, this figure is hardly precise, as we tend to rely on anecdotal evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I derive my anecdotal evidence from when I was a small businessmen and found insurance costs to be a huge barrier to innovation and enterprise. The massive cost of insurance added to my business overheads. They also were way ahead of what any other similar company paid abroad. Insurance costs are crippling innovation and enterprise in the country. If one had an idea for a new enterprise, one's first thought was it could not be done due to the implications of insurance costs. That had a crippling effect not just on the economy but on society. As a member of voluntary groups organising activities, such as cake sales or pub quizzes, to raise funds and awareness, we constantly ran into these cost implications. Massive premiums had to be paid in case someone was injured at such an activity and proceeded to make a claim against the organisation. The claims culture is crippling our society across the board, and this Bill provides one of the measures to stop it.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Much of the legal work that has been done in protecting employees where they have suffered a genuine loss has been beneficial. Many of the broad class actions and individual claims have subsequently provided regulations that were needed. The fear of potential claims brought about safety measures in the workplace. It is important that we do not lose sight of that. However, the balance has gone in the wrong direction with the positive effects of safety laws now outweighed by the huge costs that have to be borne. In many cases, lawyers and other professionals are happy to promote cases which otherwise would not be taken because of large fees for them at the end of the process. If the PIAB is a way of taking those costs out of claims, it will be a proper course of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">I disagree with some of the earlier speakers who argued that the board must be required to deal directly with the lawyer of a claimant being assessed by the PIAB. This would fundamentally undermine the purpose of the Bill. Certain lawyers could use such a provision to sow doubt in people's minds so as to ensure they had to use their advice to get the best representation. We would then be back to where we started but with a structure for lawyers and professional advisers. I disagree with such a change to the Bill. The nature of the assessment work that will be done by the board, which is largely paper-based, means that neither claimant nor correspondent will see a significant loss of rights. We need strong legislation to tackle this issue and such an amendment would undermine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I disagree with concerns that have been raised with regard to revenue records. If an individual is making a claim based on loss of income, it is valid for the PIAB, on a confidential basis, to have access to records to confirm income loss. I do not see a constitutional or legal problem where the board has such access. However, it is important that we are thorough and exact in the measures we are introducing. I am concerned about medical and professional advice that people may seek for claims. It is not just lawyers who inflated insurance costs in Ireland. A whole industry of medical and other professional advisers have benefited from the litigious culture that has developed. I am concerned about the provisions to monitor the medical assessment and claims that are coming through. I want to see a provision in the Bill which will allow some censure for medial practitioners entering claims that are inflated or misleading. It does not have to be a financial censure but can be an exclusion from further assessments by the PIAB. It would be a way of self-policing the outside medical advisers the board will employ and the quality of the advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The Minister did not accept any amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad. However, this Bill will be examined from top to toe by lawyers and will be subject to legal analysis and possible court challenges. The Minister for Transport speaking on the Road Traffic Bill 2003 said that drink driving regulations were the one area that was challenged more than any other in the courts. The same can be said for the workings of this Bill. It is important that, as the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, said, we dot the i's and cross the t's on legislation before it is enacted. To do that, the Minister needs to take account of what the Oireachtas can provide in its legislative role. There is cross-party support for this Bill but I hope she will accept amendments to rectify flaws in it and not enact it as initiated. If that is not done, the process may end up in the courts, with the PIAB compromised and the Minister ruing the day she did not listen to those arguments.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_839">Insurance reform is desperately needed. Tackling the issue in an effective way would yield real savings for individuals, community and voluntary bodies, businesses and State services. As has been pointed out in this debate, insurance premiums have rocketed in recent years. The cost of insurance for companies has doubled in the past two years. This has had severe knock-on consequences, particularly for small and medium size enterprises. Jobs have been lost because a number of companies have gone out of business as a consequence of being unable to pay these excessive insurance costs. Litigation costs alone amount to 40% of the total cost of compensation and claimants in this State are waiting up to six times longer than claimants in other EU states.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">It is not only business which is suffering because of exorbitant insurance costs. Sports clubs, voluntary bodies of all kinds, community groups and many others often find it impossible to organise fundraising events and other events which once were their bread and butter and in many cases their only source of income. This is because they cannot afford the exorbitant cost of public liability insurance cover. It is simply stifling community life as well as business activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">While any effort to reform the insurance sector is to be welcomed we must carefully examine whether the Bill will help to resolve the problem. This Bill is concerned in the first instance with employer liability insurance and not with public liability insurance, which is the greatest problem for small businesses. Importantly this Bill does not address the problems which face young drivers trying to obtain insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Before looking at the Bill itself we must question why the current insurance problems exist. They have come about as a consequence of the economic policies and political ideologies pursued by the Government. The mindset of the Progressive Democrats, encouraging rampant individualism, greed and consumerism, enables a culture of litigation to flourish. Their philosophy is based on everyone being out for themselves. They have therefore contributed to the huge cultural change in this State where people view litigation and making a claim for compensation as a reasonable way to make money to survive. The Government has courted, supported and rewarded the speculators or developers who hoard land and the tax defaulters who stash their money overseas, both of whose actions damaged the wider interests of the community as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">If there is a problem in this State with excessive eagerness to take claims for compensation, it can easily be argued that these values were learned from the top, from politicians and leaders of industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">We have higher compensation levels and we wait longer than our EU counterparts to settle claims. We wait longer because there has been a failure to reform the courts system and we pay higher compensation levels because a person who has an accident because of another person's negligence etc. faces higher medical costs. There is no national health system that would care for an accident victim without charge. Those wanting to recover as quickly as possible have little choice but the private health care system where they can obtain the necessary physiotherapy etc. for which they would have to wait an unreasonable length of time in the public sector and they might not even have the option of accessing such services in public hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Most EU states have a social security system which pays a proportion of the wages of those who cannot work after accidental injury. In this State there is very little State supported income protection for those who cannot work due to accidental injury, thus pushing many people into claiming for loss of earnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Will this Bill bring about the long-promised reform of the insurance industry? Will the PIAB bring about a reduction in insurance premiums? Will it shorten the time it takes to process cases? Will it shorten the time between a worker having an accident, lodging a justifiable claim and receiving compensation?</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The Minister stated in the Seanad that the PIAB's objective is "to tackle the delivery cost of speedier compensation to genuine claimants while reducing the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses alike." However, we have absolutely no guarantee that premiums will drop because the insurance companies have failed to give such a guarantee. When such a significant action is being made in consultation with the insurance companies why have they failed to give such an assurance?</p>
          <p eId="para_848">The aim of this Bill is to establish the PIAB as a method of eliminating the litigation overhead and the Minister has said the PIAB "will offer lower cost and speedier means of finalising genuine personal injury claims than the current litigation system." For whom will it deliver lower costs? We must be careful that the establishment of the PIAB does not end up assisting insurance companies to make even grater profits than they are currently making. In the absence of a guarantee of lower premiums this is a very real prospect.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Arguably a State-owned insurance company, which would have responsibility for indemnifying its own agencies and offering a lower cost service to the public, would provide the best option for reducing insurance premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Why was it decided that the PIAB would deal with employer liability cases in the first instance rather than addressing the areas which cause the greatest problems – motor insurance and public liability insurance. It is commonly accepted that public liability insurance faces the greatest number of fraudulent claims. At the same time workplace accidents and fatalities are unacceptably high in this State. How influential was IBEC in the decision that the PIAB would deal with employer liability cases first? Instead of this, why would the Government not put greater effort into reducing workplace accidents and fatalities? There is a risk that the Bill will not reduce the time it takes to process cases, as people will still have the option of rejecting the board's decision and going to the courts anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">I question to some degree the logic that says that because a system is becoming too expensive we should set up a new system rather than make an effort to control the current system and tackle the escalating costs of the legal profession. Legal reform designed to deliver faster and less costly processing of civil cases would have been a real option.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Under the terms of this Bill the PIAB will be able to demand information about a claimant's income and other financial affairs from the Revenue Commissioners, which would not be allowed in a court case. Will information on the profits being made by insurance companies be equally clear and transparent under the terms of this Bill? While I welcome the introduction of a book of quantum, I question why a book of quantum was not introduced under the current legal system. From the questions which remained unanswered regarding the PIAB, it is clear that it will need to be reviewed at an early date to see if it is bringing about a reduction in the cost of premiums to the consumer. A cost benefit analysis is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I seek statutory control of insurance costs accompanied by action at EU level to remove restrictions on such control. Inflated insurance costs and profiteering by insurance companies are barriers to commerce and social cohesion. The Government needs to do far more to reform the insurance industry in this State. Accident prevention, the elimination of fraudulent and exaggerated claims and court reform are all necessary if we want to see a real reduction in exorbitant insurance premiums.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_418">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_854">While the publication of this Bill leading to the establishment of the PIAB on a statutory basis is to be welcomed, it is not to be seen as the panacea to all the ills of the insurance industry. Even the Bill as published is not to be taken as complete perfection because it has some grey areas and potential flaws. The theory that establishing the PIAB will reduce insurance costs by as much as 40% is a fallacy. The 40% figure is a famous figure being thrown around by those who want to talk tough about the legal profession. This 40% is being identified as the percentage increase on compensation awards attributable to legal fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">While I am not a defender of the legal profession, it is unfair, not necessarily to the legal profession but to the long-suffering public who are crucified with insurance costs, to give them false expectations that the PIAB will automatically reduce insurance costs by 40% simply because the legal profession will be excluded. That 40% is not entirely composed of legal fees. It is a combination of a number of items, including the fees of medical and engineering expert witnesses, among others, in addition to the cost of legal fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">If that was not enough, an assumption appears to have been made that the operation of the PIAB will not cost anything. This assumption gives false hope to the public that the future in regard to insurance costs is exceedingly promising due to the introduction of the PIAB. One could be forgiven for thinking, listening to the hype coming from certain quarters, that no cost will attach to the PIAB. The respondent will be charged with funding the PIAB and he or she will pass that cost on to the policyholder.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">What will happen in a case where a claimant and respondent agree to go to the PIAB but, after a determination has been made, one or other of the parties decides to reject the determination and seek legal redress? This will lead to a doubling of costs – those associated with the legal route in addition to the costs associated with the PIAB. This will result in higher insurance costs. In such cases, the PIAB will increase costs rather than reduce them.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">A great deal of discussion has focused on legal fees. I do not defend the high level of those but, in focusing on them one can lose sight of the main goal, which is a reduction of insurance costs to businesses, householders, community and sporting organisations and motorists. In that regard, I find the forensic attention that Dorothea Dowling applies to the legal profession to be both unnatural and ill-advised. I compliment her on the close attention she is paying to this debate. While I acknowledge that a problem exists with legal fees, many other issues need critical focus and immediate attention. If one is obsessed with one issue, one may be blind to other equally important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">Many areas require attention and most of these are included in the interim report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business published last August. As a member of that committee I place on record my thanks to the various interested parties who assisted us in our work and enabled us to produce a report in a reasonably short time. The report of the joint committee contains 40 recommendations which the committee considers need to be implemented as a matter of urgency. The operative word is "urgency". The high cost of insurance to business has been identified as a major problem for at least three to four years. The Government's response to the crippling costs with which businesses are faced is disappointing. The pace of Government reform of the problematic elements attached to the high cost of insurance is boringly slow. I cannot understand why it takes so long to bring forward proposals to address the problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The delay in tackling the causes of high insurance premiums has led to job losses, companies not taking on extra employees and the closure of businesses. That is the unfortunate legacy of the failure of Government to take action sooner. An immediate practical expression of the Government's concern would be for it to abolish the 2% levy which is now merely a source of tax revenue. This was introduced at the time the PMPA was in difficulty and the necessity for it no longer exists. Therefore, as a recognition of the problems facing policyholders, this levy should be removed forthwith.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Concern has been expressed at the inconsistency of awards made to claimants in the courts. In the interest of equity and fair play, that inconsistency needs to be addressed. Specialised training needs to be introduced for judges dealing with insurance claims. Consideration also needs to be given to setting up courts solely to deal with insurance claims. Courts also need to have regard to the proposed book of quantum. Both proposals would bring consistency to court awards and lead to reduced insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">I referred earlier to the high cost of legal fees. It is universally recognised that the fees attached to compensation awards are exorbitantly high. The Government needs to address this by establishing an inquiry mainly composed of non-lawyers. Such an inquiry would undertake a study of costs and consider whether the current level of fees being awarded by the Taxing Master are reasonable. It would also consider the necessity for the extensive use of barristers in personal injury actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Awards should fully compensate claimants for injuries and losses sustained as a result of accidents. It is also necessary to ensure that the level of award takes into account similar awards in other jurisdictions as well as previous such awards in Ireland. A book of quantum should initially be published in draft form to allow various interested parties, including representatives of victims, to make submissions. I repeat that the PIAB should be obliged to use this book of quantum, as should judges when adjudicating on awards in court.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Sections 13 and 14 appear to be unnecessarily clumsy. As it is accepted that only claims where liability is not an issue will be brought to the PIAB, a mechanism should be put in place to require a claimant to have the agreement of the respondent before going through the process of lodging a claim. One of my major concerns about the PIAB and the operation of same is vulnerable claimants. For various reasons people may not be in a position to represent their case fully and with clarity and may suffer as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The PIAB may give rise to a unique situation. On the one hand will be the respondent who in most cases will be an insurance company with unlimited resources and access to both legal and medical professionals. On the other hand will be the claimant who will not be reimbursed financially if he or she employs legal professionals. On the face of it the claimant is at a disadvantage, especially if one factors into the equation that some people may have difficulty in putting together the basic paperwork for a claim. Section 29 purports to deal with this issue, but further safeguards need to be put in place to ensure that the board has a duty of care towards vulnerable parties and to ensure that claimants get their fair entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Attention will be given to fraudulent claims in the forthcoming civil liability and courts Bill. I urge the Minister to move forward quickly with this legislation as the issue of fraudulent or false claims has been identified as a contributory factor to the high cost of insurance. The causes of the high cost of insurance have been adequately highlighted and identified. The Government needs to bring forward proposals as quickly as possible to deal with the matter. Assuming all the issues will be dealt with as a matter of urgency, a monitoring committee needs to be put in place to carry out an annual review of the insurance market to ensure that benefits arising from reforms are passed on to the consumer. The insurance industry has traditionally been both secretive and unco-operative. In principle, I support the Bill. I look forward to Committee Stage when the outstanding issues can be addressed.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_869">I am glad to make a short contribution on this important legislation. It is one of the most significant items of legislation we have had in the House for some time. I compliment the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Fahey, and their officials for the preparatory work on the legislation. I can well imagine that many major issues had to be dealt with in the drafting of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The legislation before the House makes provisions which will place the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory footing. It is a fundamental aspect of the insurance reform programme the Government is implementing. The Members of this House and the public wish to see that genuine claimants receive fair compensation which is adjudicated on and paid out in a speedier manner than has been the case previously. Everyone wishes to see a reduction in costs which benefits consumers and businesses. One of the major problems for society in recent years has been the continuing increase in insurance costs. Every Member agrees that compensation claims must be assessed fairly and efficiently at minimum cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">It is horrific to discover that it takes six times longer to begin negotiations on claims in this country than it does in Britain. Similarly, litigation costs add an average of more than 40% to the cost of compensation. Those statistics are stark. They paint a picture of an insurance system which has been out of control for a number of years. Individuals, businesses and society suffer from the consequences of an insurance regime which is out of control. Central and local government have been defrauded on many occasions over the years. Compensation claims have been awarded against them which were totally out of step with reality. I hope the introduction of this legislation goes a long way to ensuring that the process is rectified and pay outs of this sort are put behind us. I emphasise that genuine claimants must have their claims assessed and adjudicated upon in as speedy a manner as possible at minimum cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">During the general election campaign of April and May 2002, one of the major issues brought to the attention of politicians was the cost of insurance. It is particularly noticeable in rural areas where young people face huge motor insurance costs. As I canvassed, I met many people who provided me with details of exorbitant quotations for motor vehicle insurance. Those quotations denied people the opportunity to insure a vehicle and to take up employment at locations to which they needed a car to travel. I heard a person in the insurance industry recently compliment Quinn Direct, a major company in my county. Quinn Direct recently placed a full page advertisement in the national press in which was presented a scale of insurance costs for a young person at ages 18 to 25 with a one-year, no claims bonus. I understand from people working in the industry that this is the first time any company has provided information to young people who have been treated scandalously by other insurance firms. I compliment Quinn Direct on its innovative approach and on its initiative to ensure that young people can find motor vehicle insurance at a reasonable cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">We can look forward to important legislation which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is to introduce. He is preparing a civil liability and courts Bill which will include a number of measures with which to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims within the courts system. The Bill will represent an important and welcome legislative measure which will assist in the reform of the insurance industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">I take this opportunity to compliment the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, who established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The remit of the board was to advise the Government about the structures and reforms needed to tackle the escalation in insurance costs. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment showed great foresight and wisdom in appointing Ms Dorothea Dowling as chairman of the board. Any Member who had the opportunity to listen to Ms Dowling speak about the need for insurance reform and her determination to ensure that the reform came about as quickly as possible, could only be impressed by her interest, knowledge and commitment to the insurance reform programme. In appointing Ms Dowling to chair the new board Deputy Harney has made another wise decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">In establishing the boards which will act in an advisory capacity to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, I hope the Minister ensures that all interests are represented including consumers. It amazes me that insurance companies got away with murder in the aftermath of 11 September 2001 when they jacked up insurance costs beyond all comprehension. Insurance costs affect every sector of the economy. Escalating insurance costs have led to job losses. Every public representative has met individuals from small and large businesses who have spoken of their absolute frustration when seeking a reasonable insurance quotation. We have all dealt with companies who could not even find a quotation, never mind insurance cover at a reasonable cost. I hope the insurance reform programme ensures that those days are behind us.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The huge increase in the cost of insurance to schools has come to our attention in recent months. This must be addressed. Insurance companies must be asked why insurance premia were jacked up so much in the Irish market after 11 September 2001 when they did not rise to the same extent in the United States of America or other major economies. If our economy is to remain competitive, we must have a competitive and fair insurance regime. Even if its cost is reasonable, insurance is still a significant expense for any company. In a few short years, there was a 300% increase in public liability premia which was unwarranted and uncalled for. Insurance companies, especially the larger ones which had the entire market at their feet due to lack of competition, were in a position to charge whatever they wanted.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">This legislation will ensure that the legal profession is, to some extent, brought to heel. There is no doubt that solicitors and barristers have creamed off money. Exorbitant fees have been charged by professional solicitors, barristers, doctors and engineers. The fees charged by various professionals in particular cases were often in excess of the awards made to genuine claimants. I look forward to the continuation of urgently required insurance reform by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey and their officials.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelOFlynn" eId="spk_422">
          <from>Mr. O'Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_878">I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for their initiative in bringing forward this Bill. At the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party conference in Sligo, the cost of insurance topped the agenda. The Government is now passing legislation to give effect to new laws on claims and compensation which I welcome. The topic of the prohibitive cost of all types of insurance is raised in everyday conversation all over the country. There is a common belief among motorists, particularly young drivers, employers, sporting clubs, house owners and any person or group that pays insurance, that they pay far too much for cover. There is a common perception that one is dealing with a monopoly that ensures one is always quoted the same terms. No matter where one shops around, one does not really have a choice. The Competition Authority is to assess whether there are anti-competitive practices and whether price increases across sectors are in line with international trends.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">For years insurance bodies have been telling their customers about their losses to which they have attributed their high quotations. Given that they recorded massive profits in 2002, the public expects a drop in rates in line with the logic being used by the companies involved – we are losing money, the public must pay more. The public expects to reap the benefit as it sees the insurance business prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The price of insurance is one of the main costs facing consumers and business. Many factors have a negative effect on insurance and we have a compensation culture that encourages litigation for personal injury damages. Litigation costs are estimated to increase insurance costs by more than one third. In addition, the legal system is far too expensive. Rising premiums have a bad economic effect on business and jobs. Commercial liability insurance costs an estimated €2 billion annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Under forthcoming legislation, people who make false claims could face perjury charges and the prospect of fines and imprisonment. Claimants must lodge a letter of notice within eight weeks of the alleged incident occurring or face possible liability for legal costs. I welcome the fact those who refuse to take part in a mediation conference could be liable for costs. Those measures will mean that insurance firms pursue false claims more vigorously. Insurers will now have incentives in that if a small part of the claim is not being made in good faith, the whole claim is invalidated. The new measures should be of major benefit to the insured, particularly younger drivers who pay such astronomical premiums. Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us whether insurance companies will be obliged to admit liability at the scene of accidents if their insured driver is responsible or whether they will face perjury charges if they do not contest the claims subsequently at the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I have some reservations about the Bill, as drafted. I have received numerous representations from constituents, including professional people such as lawyers, solicitors, doctors and engineers, who have expressed concerns about aspects of the Bill. I raised them with the Minister of State at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting the other night. I cannot tell the House exactly what I said because I might be brought in before the Taoiseach or the chairman of the party.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_423">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_883">The Deputy is used to that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelOFlynn" eId="spk_424">
          <from>Mr. O'Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_884">I ask the Minister of State to consider these concerns on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">There is an imbalance in the position of the claimant in relation to that of the respondent, the insurance company. How will claimants be able to deal with such an unfamiliar ordeal as assembling professional documents and putting forward their case without professional help? By professional help, I mean solicitors, doctors and engineers to help them assemble a proper case so it can be presented to the PIAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The Government's implementation group suggested that where legal representation is not provided for, there could be a <i>de facto</i> inequality between the claimant and the insurance company. I agree with that because the insurance company will have a professional team available to it to assemble its response to a claim which, of course, will be at the expense of the policy holder. No legal representation will be allowed and while I do not have a difficulty with that, a scale of fees should be available to people. For example, an old lady who is knocked down by a car but who does not have a professional person to advise her nor the resources to get one, should be able to get professional help. There should be a scale of fees which would allow an old lady who is knocked down to present her case to the PIAB in a professional manner and which would enable her, the injured party, to get the best possible result.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">We have ignored the findings of the Government's PIAB implementation group. Mr. Frank Cunneen of the Health and Safety Authority chaired this group and stated that considerations of natural justice and the legitimate expectations of all participants in the process argue for the making of some provisions for the recovery of legal fees. Despite this recommendation, the Bill does not make provision for legal representation at document level, unless the claimant pays for it. The Bill appears to indicate that the claimant must discharge out of his or her own pocket the cost of all medical and other reports submitted to the board to support his or her claim. The Bill proposes that the board may, at its discretion, reimburse the costs of these reports but only in exceptional circumstances. These reports cost on average €250 each and are generally funded by the solicitor under the present system. The effect of this proposal could disadvantage innocent victims of accidents, some of whom will not have the funds to pay for reports that would ensure their claims are properly presented.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">The Bill is supposedly aimed at the general cost and the overall efficiency of the system. While there are legitimate areas of concern, any publicly funded system should not be made cheaper or be made to appear more efficient by curtailing the rights of those using it. A constitutional right to fair procedures is well established. If the documents submitted by a claimant are made available to the respondent at the discretion of the board, then the respondent will have been allowed to force the claimant to lay all his or her cards on the table. In this situation, the respondent, the insurance company, reserves its own position. The absence of legal representation will hinder the proper preparation and submission of the claims to the board in the first instance. Claimants will require professional assistance in putting a claim together. For example, if one was building a house, one would seek the assistance of an engineer or an architect as one could not build it one's self unless one was a professional. The formulation of these claims is difficult enough, even in simple cases. I repeat that scale of fees should be available for those preparing their claims, otherwise I see a professional claims body or person, who will assist people in assembling, submitting and presenting claims, springing up in the future. I forecast a whole new industry growing out of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Matters become more complicated if there is a difficult medical situation. This could arise where the claimant is no longer able to work as a result of an accident or is forced to work at a reduced capacity. There would then be a need to formulate a claim for future loss of earnings. Who will investigate this? Will it be the board? The Bill confers particular strategic advantages on the respondent, the insurance company. A respondent which intends to defend the issue of liability can still argue about a matter going before the board even if it has no intention of accepting the board's assessment. By letting the claim proceed before the board, the respondent will be able to flush out the compensation aspect of the claim in a forum in which the claimant will not have the resources to present a case effectively. The respondent will know the figures assessed by the board and will be given free rein to attack the compensation aspects of the claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">I make these comments because I fear claimants may reject unfair offers to satisfy their claims and take their cases to court anyway because of low pay outs to claims and further clog up the court system. I do not have a vested interest in this matter. I want to see cheaper insurance policies and an end to fraud but I also want fair play for genuine claimants in a "documents only" process. I urge the Minister of State to consider my views and concerns, including a scale of fees for the preparation of documents for genuine claimants. The Bill, as it stands, is tilted in favour of the respondent, the insurance company. That does not provide a fair procedure for claimants and will operate to the benefit of insurance companies.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_893">I want to declare my interest, small as it is – I am an original shareholder of FBD and was involved in the setting up of that farmer-owned company. I am proud it is a successful company and is doing a first-class job. I am unhappy with the amount of money I have to pay for my insurance at present and make no apology for letting the company know that.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">It is important that this Bill is passed but it is equally important that we have competition in the system. I put a question to the Minister this week on the matter and am glad she said her Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a study into the insurance market which will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on competition in the market. That element is part of the problem of high cost insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Recently a local school pleaded with me on account of it having to spend €27,000 for insurance this year. Because it is independently run, unlike a VEC school, it must pay that bill from its own resources. A playground in Glaslough which must meet an insurance bill of €10,000 will almost certainly be closed unless someone takes it over. A small business I know of faces a bill of €17,000. These examples have come to my attention in the past week.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Some people claim insurance costs have gone down. Insurance for some motorists has gone down and I welcome that. While it may seem the Government has only been in power for 18 months, the Minister with responsibility for this issue, the Tánaiste, has been in power for seven and a half years. The issue did not arise yesterday. We need to ensure full action is taken on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">My colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, recently visited four factories in my constituency with me and met the local chamber of commerce. The principal issue that arose during his visit, apart from the lack of job creation, was insurance. I was glad to hear my colleague from Cavan-Monaghan, Deputy Brendan Smith, make the point about 11 September. It was important that somebody on the Government benches should make that point. I agree that insurance companies got away with murder after 11 September. Who let them away with it? It is clear that they did not get away with murder in the United States or the rest of Europe. We sat back and allowed it to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I welcome this Bill and hope it will do something to resolve the problem. I also welcome the promise made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring in a Bill to deal with fraudulent claims which will make it easier to handle that problem. These claims have created unnecessary costs for insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The Minister must take responsibility for the insurance problem but she is only taking responsibility in a narrow field. In her statement she says that the PIAB will not deal with cases involving medical negligence. Medical negligence is one of our more serious problems. If we continue to have 40%, 50% or 70% legal charges for medical negligence compensation insurance, our problems will continue. In my local hospital in Monaghan the maternity unit was closed down, supposedly because of medical claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">I concur with Deputy O'Flynn's remarks about who prepares a claim. A short time ago I spoke to a Minister about a grant I hoped a group would get but the Minister claimed the wording was slightly wrong and said it would have been better if the form had been filled in properly. If an old lady has an accident, who fills in the form for her or who pays for her personal medical expenses? These issues must be dealt with in the Bill before it passes through the House and I am glad the issue was raised by a Member from the Government benches.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">In the Minister's statement she says that section 46 permits the board to make rules which will be set down in regulation. We need to know what those rules are before the Bill is sanctioned. It is unfair to be asked to sign a blank cheque. It is often the small print that causes a problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_428">
          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_902">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. High insurance costs have been the bane of consumer and business life in Ireland since 1999. In that period we have seen premiums for motor, household and all forms of liability insurance rise to an exorbitant level. I have heard at first hand harrowing testimony from business people who have had to curtail their business plans or cease trading as a direct result of high insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">I know of one case where insurance rose from £3,000 in 1999 to a quote this year of €29,000. I know of a small hotel which had to close its doors because of the huge cost of insurance. Examples can be found throughout the industry. It has been suggested that some premiums have increased by 100% per annum for each of the four years since 1999. This is a shocking level of increase for any business to sustain and is particularly galling for a business that has never made a claim. This is a worrying aspect of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">The high cost of motor and household insurance is a serious imposition on consumers. Major increases in the cost of living and the rising level of taxes add further costs to the exorbitant premiums faced by motorists and householders. Premiums have recently started to reduce even without the enactment of the reforms in this Bill. However, the levels of reduction and the inability of insurance companies to commit to specific levels of reduction is a concern. I was pleased to see the cost of car insurance reduce recently, be it by a small amount, particularly for younger drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">Members of this House need to send a strong message to the insurance industry that we expect clear examples of the reforms being brought forward in this Bill. We demand that the insurance industry delivers cheaper insurance and does not try to fudge the passing on of reductions to consumers and businesses. I hope the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, have received bankable guarantees from the insurance industry and the insurance federation that they will deliver cheaper insurance. Unfortunately, the insurance industry has previously failed to pass on savings that resulted from reforms passed by the Oireachtas. Measures that were supposed to remedy the problem of high insurance costs were passed by the Oireachtas in the past. I refer, for example, to the abolition of juries in most civil cases and the removal of the two senior counsel rule. The levels of insurance costs remain high, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I recognise the role this Bill should play in reducing insurance costs. It should reduce the cost of delivering compensation to those involved in accidents. I do not doubt that the litigation system has been costly, particularly in cases in which liability is not an issue between the parties. We could all cite the cases of friends or constituents who had to go to court to seek compensation after being injured in accidents. While there have been cases of lawyers milking the system to maximum benefit from a cost perspective, it is true that insurance companies have been slow to concede liability and to negotiate settlements. I hope that insurers will adopt a constructive approach to this Bill. They should not seek to test the water in PIAB cases and then decide to fight the cases in court.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">I do not doubt that all Members are keen to ensure that insurance costs are reduced. That was certainly my intention in contributing to this debate. Regardless of whether one is a motorist or a businessman, one would like to have lower insurance. No issue has been the subject of such concern on the part of constituents throughout the country. People want cheaper insurance. I am prepared to give this Bill a chance. Its success will be judged on its ability to deliver cheaper insurance.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_429">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_908">I thank Deputy Hayes for sharing his time with me. I am delighted to speak on the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003 because high insurance costs are a problem for businesses and consumers throughout the country. All businesses have seen rapid increases in employers' liability, public liability and motor insurance. There are many reasons for these increases. They are partly due to our culture of compensation, but they may also be due to the inefficiency of the court system's delivery of compensation to plaintiffs. This Bill sets out to address the latter problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">When a person takes out an insurance policy, one often gets the impression that he or she abdicates all his or her rights to the insurance company. This frequently means that the insurance company can do what it likes about the claim, regardless of the policy holder's perspective. I suspect that this phenomenon is part of the reason problems have arisen in this area. I do not doubt that thousands of indignant policy holders throughout the country, who have been involved in accidents, are frustrated beyond belief at the unwillingness of insurance companies to defend actions. Insurance companies sometimes will not settle a case that should be settled until it reaches the door of the courts. While some opportunistic lawyers may be to blame for the problems that have arisen in litigation and costs, there is no doubt that insurance companies have some element of culpability because of their tardy management of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I am always concerned when new State bodies are touted as solutions to complex problems. The establishment of the PIAB is not an exception in this regard. State authorities and quangos which have been established in the past ten years have absorbed considerable amounts of public money. It was hoped that such bodies would improve the lot of consumers and businesses but, with very few exceptions, they have failed to deliver. The Competition Authority has not brought about more competition for consumers, the work of the Commission for Energy Regulation has not resulted in cheaper electricity or better choice for consumers and the Commission for Communications Regulation has not been able to achieve any great benefits for consumers. The recent publication of the profits of two mobile telephone companies bears out the latter point.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I earnestly hope that the PIAB will not become just another quango. We do not need another layer of bureaucracy because the country is being choked with such bodies at present. Not only is it important that the PIAB set realistic and achievable targets, but it should also be able to deliver on its objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">I share the concerns expressed earlier by some of my colleagues, as well as Members from other parties, about the absence of entitlement to representation in one's dealings with the PIAB. While I appreciate that the PIAB will not have oral hearings, one should be able to instruct a solicitor to act on one's behalf, as long as one is prepared to pay the cost of such representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">There have been many references to fraudulent claims and their impact on insurance prices. Perhaps the most worrying claim made in recent weeks has been that the PIAB will deal only with those cases in which liability is not an issue. Contributions to the Seanad debate on this matter, as well as to this debate earlier today, suggest that the PIAB will deal with cases where liability is not at issue for as long as the insurance company decides liability is not at issue. Most right-thinking and fair-minded people would be appalled to hear that insurance companies can force claimants to go to the PIAB and then disregard the assessment reached by the PIAB if they feel the amount is too much.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">I hope the Minister will examine this aspect of the legislation. It is patently unfair that claimants will be placed at a considerable disadvantage. They may be subjected to delays of up to 15 months before their cases get under way in earnest. The Minister cannot allow the possibility of such a serious injustice to be part of the new regime. I suspect that the new regime will fail if she does not make changes in this regard. If it does not flounder on the rocks of constitutional lawyers, it will flounder on the lack of acceptance of the board by the public. This would be a major problem from the start.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The Minister needs to do very little to this Bill to secure all-party support for it. It is wrong that she is trying to ram through this legislation. She seems to regard the Dáil as a mere clearing house for the recommendations of the interim PIAB. Genuine and serious concerns have been expressed about issues of representation and liability. The concerns, which extend beyond the vested interests of any particular sector, are genuine. When assessed from the perspective of a legislator, it is obvious that amendments are needed and I hope the Minister will provide for this on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The Minister should place severe and unrelenting pressure on the insurance industry to deliver reductions in premiums to consumers. I hope insurers manage to secure reductions in the cost of compensation, but it would be appalling if such reductions find their way into the profits of large insurance companies. Consumers will not tolerate such actions in respect of this matter of concern. I hope the Minister will take these points into account on Committee Stage. As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I intend to maintain a firm hold on the PIAB to ensure that it is effective. It should not be another layer of bureaucracy to block up the system. I will be unrelenting in the pursuit of this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">I welcome this Bill, but I am concerned that a claimant should have the right to be represented by a solicitor at an initial hearing. The argument in favour of such a right must be listened to. I know there is a perception that the system is fuelled by lawyers' costs. If there is a possibility that a claim can be thrown out, the claimant should have the right to be represented by a solicitor at an initial hearing as long as he or she is willing to pay for the privilege.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Previous speakers mentioned the bottom line of insurance companies and the lack of competition in the trade, which is unfair. Although it is an open market, the culture of compensation which has taken a foothold in this economy means that high levels of costs are associated with small companies. There is a need for traceability and accountability. I do not know how insurance companies can justify increasing their premiums by 100% or 200%. The Consumers Association of Ireland should bring insurers to task, for example, by asking them how they can justify increasing the insurance costs of those who have not made additional claims. It is true that certain claims can be without foundation. Although the points system is effective, it is important that we do not establish a quango that will not have effective powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I hope that the points I have raised in this contribution regarding lawyers' representations at the initial stages where the client will bear the cost of the initial appearance fee will be taken on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_922">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. If one were to see a negative side to it, it is that it has taken so long to come before the House. The Government is to be commended on what it has done in the insurance industry. It is possibly another milestone in the reform of the insurance industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Every Member of the House is well aware of the problems encountered by industry, the commercial sector and individuals through the high cost of insurance, over the past five years in particular. Motorists have seen their premia go through the roof in that time. Householders find it increasingly difficult to secure competitive rates to insure their homes, and employers have, over the past three years, in my experience at least, found it increasingly difficult even to get companies to give them a quote for public and employers' liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">Comment has been made about insurance companies running some kind of closed shop. In fairness to them, they work in a difficult climate in this country. If it were that easy for insurance companies to operate profitably in Ireland, there would be far more of them here. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Over the past four months, we have investigated the insurance industry. The number of submissions we have received from insurance companies is amazing. When those individuals attended – very willingly, I might add – to make presentations to the committee and were asked why there is not more competition in the Irish insurance industry, they said that, as soon as international companies heard that they were interested in getting involved in the Irish insurance industry, they simply walked away. They were not interested because of our history of fraudulent and exaggerated claims. One hopes that, with the change in legislation and the new improvements that various Ministers have made, including the Tánaiste, who is to be commended on bringing this legislation forward, the Minister for Transport, who introduced penalty points, as well as the co-ordinated action of the Government, we will now see that international companies are considering Ireland as a place where they can do business.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">The establishment of the PIAB is one of the central aspects of the Government's insurance reform programme. It will arrange for speedier compensation to genuine claimants while reducing the cost of insurance to customers and business. It will bring new competition to the Irish insurance market, and one hopes that it will be reflected in our having more competitive insurance quotations for the public. One central theme in this debate is that, where claimants are genuine, they should be assured that their claims will not be affected by the introduction of this legislation. I know that the Minister made that point in his opening address. They need the comfort of knowing that the legislation is not aimed at them or at cutting their compensation claims. It is hoped that it will make for a climate where claims can be processed more speedily and the cost of litigation cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">One interesting statistic which has come out in this debate is that the cost of litigation in the UK is around 4% to 7% for most claims, while here it is up to 40%. If one wished to see evidence of that, all one would have to do would be look back on the past three to four years at what I can only call the scandal of the Army deafness claims. It will cost this State around €300 million to pay out those claims, yet the cost of litigation payments to the solicitors and barristers involved is almost one third –€100 million. That is a disgrace, and I do not see how the umbrella body for the legal profession can try to justify the inordinate fees claimed by several solicitors and barristers, and it has done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">It does no credit to the legal profession that its members are allowed to do that. They can justify it by saying that those fees were agreed beforehand with the Office of the Attorney General, but morally they stand indicted for the practice whereby claims coming from individuals go to a clerk-typist. All that she does is change the name and address on it and send it in to the Department. She gets paid full fees on that. It is a disgrace, and I have said that to the legal profession itself. We in this House must sometimes suffer the slings and arrows aimed at the misdeeds of some of our colleagues. Legal professionals should also examine some of the actions of their colleagues and the manner in which they carry out their public functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">As I said, the PIAB is a welcome development. One hopes that it will be in place by early next year so that claimants can see genuine reductions in legal costs. One aspect to it is that, when the Tánaiste introduced this legislation, the immediate reaction from the Bar Council and the solicitors' governing body was to pick holes in it. In doing so, I hope that they are responsible enough not to delay the legislation's passage onto the Statute Book by taking Supreme Court actions on the basis of its constitutionality. Some of the comments certainly kept that option open, and it would be unfair if the profession took such an attitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">I notice that the Tánaiste is confident that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will face no constitutional difficulties, and I hope she is correct. I presume she has had discussions with the legal profession and sought its assurances in that regard. If she has not, I hope she will do so. She is confident that the PIAB will be operational by early next year and will drive down the cost of insurance so that we can see it reduced significantly by next spring. The Tánaiste kept her promise – a Government commitment given some time ago – to tackle the high cost of insurance in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board will make awards regarding claims where legal issues are not disputed. It must be pointed out that there is no dispute where the PIAB issues findings. All such cases must first be referred to the PIAB. In contrast to the current adversarial system with legal teams on each side, the PIAB assessors will seek to ascertain the facts and make awards on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">Claimants in Ireland must wait six months longer than in the UK. That is not acceptable. I see no reason for claimants here to have to wait so long for their claims to be negotiated and for the commencement of litigation in this area. We need an alternative to the courts system to process our cases. In the presentations made to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, all the insurance companies bar one referred to the inordinate cost of litigation. They are confident that, if this legislation is passed – and I hope that we have the support of all sides of the House in our efforts to put it on the Statute Book – we will see genuine reductions in the cost of insurance to everyone. When we reflect back on this time next year, we will see the benefits of this legislation. Through this and the penalty points system, introduced by the Minister for Transport, we will see the number of claims reduced and consequent reduction in the cost of premiums to motorists and citizens in general.</p>

          <from>Mr. T. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_932">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Ó Nualláin as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom. Tá áthas orm labhairt go gairid faoi chúrsaí costais agus árachais. Le linn an olltoghcháin, ní raibh aon rud ba mhó a bhí ar theanga an gnáth duine ná cé chomh ard agus costasach agus a bhí árachas. Tá sé thar a bheith in am dúinn mar pholaiteoirí rud éigin a dhéanamh chun na faidhbe sin a shárú.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">It is beyond time that we addressed the escalating costs of insurance. Some time ago, when its representatives visited the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, the Irish Hotels Federation told us that the cost of insuring members' premises had increased by between 350% and 400% in three years. The Government must shout "Stop" and address this problem and I congratulate the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the Bill which will give it statutory effect is the beginning of that shout to stop. Many Deputies have said it would be a huge mistake to regard the PIAB as a panacea for the ills of the insurance industry. It would be a monumental error because insurance and the problems it presents for Irish industry depends on the interplay of many different bodies. The PIAB will provide a focus and a beginning to the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">It will require that employers and employees address issues of health and safety in the workplace in order to eliminate the huge number of avoidable accidents which occur each year. Some time ago a slogan stated, "Accidents do not happen – they are caused". The public too must realise that the compensation culture in which we have all indulged is not a free dinner. It is the public who pays the price by way of escalating premium costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The functioning of the Civil Liability and Courts Bill will have a huge role, as will the Competition Authority. I am a member of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and I cannot understand how an industry which made €183 million last year does not have people knocking on the door to come into the Irish market. No one has been able to explain that. Normally, if an industry is making that kind of profit, companies would be bidding to come in. Foreign companies do not want to come into the market and those which have subsidiaries here are happy enough. We do not have too many Irish-based companies. The Competition Authority has a role to play in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">As a member of the enterprise committee, I discovered that some companies do not insure hotels. When I took a taxi to Leinster House the other day, I discovered that a company, which I happened to be lauding at the time, does not insure taxis. The players in the market do not even compete with each other for certain business.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, also has an important role and has played it well to date. The professional bodies have a role too because the costs of the legal and medical input into claims and awards is excessive, in comparison to other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">The PIAB will hopefully bring a new approach to settling claims and will eliminate the need for legal input where legal matters are not in dispute, which seems eminently sensible. One can play 15 players on a football team, but one cannot play 16. It is the same in this case – if the legal people are not needed and facts are not disputed, they should not be there. That is what this is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Insurance costs are the second highest costs to Irish industry. A Fine Gael Deputy spoke about businesses throwing in the towel because they could not afford the insurance. What is worse is that some companies are operating without insurance and others are in the business of self-insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">One of the big problems with the awards system is the slowness with which awards are made. The process is six times slower than in the UK and it must be expedited. The Bill giving statutory effect to the PIAB will help to do just this.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">The PIAB can eliminate huge legal costs and offer a more balanced assessment of damages by paying due respect to the book of quantum which will inform the board in helping to reach negotiated settlements. No one in this House wants people who are genuinely injured not to be properly compensated. However, we must direct the compensation towards the victim of the accident rather than the various practitioners who play a role in the current set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">The fact that the Government has focused on the problems with insurance and that the committee has focused on it as a target to be addressed has already led to a number of important new developments which are crucial to industry and to citizens. Every family is affected by the cost of insurance. Those of us who have teenagers find we cannot get motor insurance for them and even sons and daughters who are 27 or 28 years of age are unable to pay premiums. I was glad to hear that one insurance company brought down the cost of hotel insurance by 28% and another has reduced the cost of motor insurance by 10% to 12%.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">Only yesterday, I saw in one of the newspapers that there has been a striking decline in the number of cases going to the High Court. This is not accidental. Rather, it is because we have created a consciousness in regard to the challenge of insurance costs. The Irish Insurance Federation campaign to follow up and root out fraudulent claims has also led to that reduction. As the Irish phrase states –"Tús maith, leath na h-oibre"– a good beginning is half the work. We have made a good beginning by focusing on what the cost of insurance really means, namely, the loss of jobs, the impossibility of insuring a young man who wants to drive to his workplace and so on. If the beginning has been good, let us make sure the Bill is passed and the PIAB functions in the desired manner and premiums become affordable.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_947">Everyone wants to see cheaper insurance and I do not want to give the impression that every insurance claim is fraudulent. People who are injured and have to make a claim to an insurance company should not feel guilty. It is bad enough being injured, possibly so badly that one may not be right for the rest of one's life, without people thinking that, because one goes to court, one is wrong. If a person is injured in a car accident, a work accident, a football or hurling accident, he or she has a right to claim if there is insurance to claim from.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">Some people made claims because they received advice that they should do so. They were told it was worth a try, that they had nothing to lose. That attitude is unacceptable and should not be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">I am not a particular supporter of the legal profession. However, it has a point in respect of the Bill. I am concerned that people will not be able to be represented by their solicitors.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_438">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_951">I will deal with that in a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">I wish to provide some examples in support of my argument. We were informed that when the electricity regulator came into office we would have cheaper electricity. In the past 12 months the cost of electricity has risen by over 17%. The regulator allowed the price to rise on three occasions in that period. We were also informed that when the telecommunications regulator took office we would pay less for our calls. What has happened? Two of the mobile phone companies operating here are robbing people. These companies impose the highest charges for calls in Europe. The regulator failed in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">What I do not want to happen on foot of the Bill is that instead of money being paid to solicitors, engineers and assessors, it will be given to the board. I do not want people sitting in an office somewhere in Dublin to be given the money relating to insurance claims and previously paid to solicitors and others. I hope that does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">I want the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to work. People cannot afford to pay the kind of insurance premiums they have been obliged to pay in the past three to four years. A friend of mine in north Mayo who had been with an insurance company for over 15 years was informed two years ago that it was going to consider whether it would assess him or retain his business. He had made no claims but he was involved in a high risk business. He eventually obtained insurance from another company but over a period of weeks he lost half a stone in weight because he was concerned that the would have to give up his business or try to operate without insurance, something his legal adviser counselled against.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">I am concerned about the making of claims in written form. There are people who will need help and support in this regard because they will not be able to complete forms. As practising politicians, we are faced each day in our constituency offices with those who cannot fill out forms. I would not like people who would be entitled to make claims failing to do so because they could not get assistance in filling out these complicated forms. I hope these people can be given the help they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">Another profession has created problems for the insurance industry and people are afraid to criticise it. I refer to the medical profession, which has an important role to play in respect of claims. Nine times out of ten it is the medical report which decides a claim. Like certain people in politics or the legal profession, I am sure there are those in the medical profession who do not take their responsibilities seriously and who do not complete forms in the way they should. Careful consideration must be given to this matter. As with other professions, there are very many good people involved but there are also some bad apples.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">People have always been of the opinion that insurance companies are soft touches. Such companies must take much of the blame for this. I am aware of a traffic accident involving a person riding a bicycle with no light. The individual was prosecuted in the courts and lost the case but the insurance company paid out almost €50,000 in settlement of the claim because it was not prepared to fight the case in court. Insurance companies have a lot to answer for because they do not contest enough cases. They contest larger cases which involve major sums of money. However, they should have taken on those involved in cases relating to smaller claims and sent out a message similar to that being sent out by the Oireachtas, the business sector and everybody else that enough is enough. People can no longer afford to pay the kind of charges being imposed by insurance companies and those companies should no longer support people who make claims that are not justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">People are beginning to realise that while they may defraud their insurance companies, everyone else will be obliged to foot the bill. It is somewhat similar to the social welfare system; if someone defrauds the State, there is less money for everyone else. The same applies to insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I hope the Bill works. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has promised to introduce further legislation to help reduce insurance costs. It is important, in terms of industry, businesses and job creation, that we send out the message that this country is not full of people who make claims against insurance companies. It is also important that from now on we monitor the activities of insurance companies in order to ensure that if there is a reduction in the number of claims, they will pass on the benefits to their customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">We must ensure that those involved with the board are accountable to the House and that they will be in a position in a year's time to inform us whether the system has worked. If it has not worked, they must indicate what legislation will be required to make it work. I have no difficulty in supporting the Bill as long as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board operates on a trial basis for one year. However, I do not want what happened with the National Roads Authority and the various regulators to recur with this board. I refer to the fact that when one writes to the regulators in respect of problems, they reply that they do not have responsibility in a particular area and that further legislation is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">If the Bill needs to be amended on Committee Stage so that the board will be given the powers it requires, so be it. We have to support people who are finding it difficult to obtain personal, motor or business insurance. A number of people have gone out of business in recent years because of insurance costs. One cannot operate a business without insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">I hope the Bill works. I hope the Minister, Deputy Harney, will put in place the necessary regulations which will allow people the opportunity to make their claims. However, I also hope that we are not making a mistake in respect of people not having legal representation. We do not want people stating a few years from now that their injuries were worse than first thought and that because they did not have legal representation they did not get the level of compensation they would otherwise have received. People can obtain advice, but they will not be paid for legal representation if they avail of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The Bill should not discriminate against the legal profession. Members of that profession are no different to the insurance assessors or engineers who make reports on claims. There is an old saying to the effect that, "We will add a few bob on to the cost because the insurance company is paying". Insurance companies do not pay, it is ordinary people who pay through their premiums. Insurance companies pay out on claims but it is their customers who pay the cost. The insurance companies will not foot the bill. As in the past, they will pass on the charges. Insurance companies want to make profits and there is nothing wrong with that. No business will remain in operation unless it can make a profit. Insurance companies want to obtain the best value for money and, like councils, they must remain within their budgets. For the Minister of State's sake and that of insurance companies and the country, I hope the legislation works.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_439">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_964">I welcome the Bill which is a genuine effort to try to put right what has gone terribly wrong in terms of the insurance culture in this country. In itself, however, it will not make a huge difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">What is needed is a system under which compensation will be paid in a speedier manner to genuine claimants. The insurance industry is beset by such a raft of problems and it is to its credit that the Government is at least trying to grapple with these. The Bill has no shortage of detractors, but they are all vested interests. We will have to wait to see how the legislation operates, but there are a number of fundamental things which could go wrong. I will deal with these later. However, the legal profession is bleating about this legislation and it is a significant vested interest. While I am not anti-legal eagle, no Government or electorate will put up with a system in which €40,000 must be added for legal fees to an average personal injury claim for €100,000. A mechanism such as the PIAB was inevitable and the legal profession has only got itself to blame.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">These cases in the long-term will come down to a judgment call on the part of the claimant as he or she decides what is the best avenue to take in terms of pursuing his or her claim. Like most rational human beings, claimants will ask whether their best interests are served by going through the board or whether they should pursue their cases through the courts. I do not have great expertise in this area. If the board gets off to a reasonable start with claimants believing they are reasonably well looked after, their best interests are served and they do not have second thoughts about the process, there is a great chance the board will work. The results of the claims will be published and people will compare notes. If the news goes around that the PIAB is not as good to claimants financially as it might be, the Government will face a great deal of trouble. This is a significant danger. The benefit of the doubt on legislation such as this must be given to the Minister who is doing her best to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">The Minister of State will recall a sentiment expressed by Pat McDonagh, owner of the Supermacs chain and a significant employer. I cannot recall more people agreeing with a single sentiment than that expressed by him. He caught a fraudulent claimant on camera. An individual slipped deliberately so that he could pursue a claim. However, this phenomenon was widespread judging by the reaction to his statement.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_441">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_969">People who are genuinely injured have a right to be treated properly. However, those caught on the dodge are not dealt with harshly enough under the law. Their carry on is outrageous. Local authorities must pay professionals to act as private investigators in an effort to come to grips with this problem and, unfortunately, the compensation paid on fraudulent claims is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">My experience of dealing with insurance companies on behalf of constituents down the years is, if there is a way out in the small print of a policy, they will get out. I have witnessed cases where insurance companies were morally obliged to pay but, when it came down to it, they would not do so. I hope they will take extra responsibility when they avail of this process. It will be in their interests in terms of insurance rates to ensure the board works.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Unfortunately, I am aware of many businesses that do not have public liability insurance and that is dangerous. One must object to that because businesses are taking a chance and it is bad news for their employees and themselves if anything goes wrong. However, at the end of the day, the 500% leap in the cost of premia over the past four or five years is not sustainable. I know people who employed seven or eight workers in a high risk businesses and the only way they could afford insurance was to sack two workers. That was not good because the company had outlets for its products and was generating sales. It is difficult for company owners and even more difficult for those who lost their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">I hope insurance companies understand that, if they get involved in this process, it is in their interest that it works. I hope there will be fewer costly claims in future, but the savings made should not be added to the bank balances of the insurance companies. Many people are suspicious that such companies looked upon the board as a positive development for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Claimants can decide to pursue their case through the board but, if they do, they are prevented from taking the legal route. Some will argue, as Deputy Ring stated, that they do not have the wherewithal to make a case to the board. What professional expertise will be available to make people feel secure when they appear before the board? The process is document-based. Will solicitors have to be employed to prepare the documents? I assume it is up to the claimant to decide which person he or she wants to do this. These are technical points but they are terribly important.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">When the board comes into operation, I hope it will cover various types of insurance. I refer to motor insurance. A number of insurance companies have begun to see the light of day and they have reduced their premia but there is a long way to go.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Garda Stations.</heading>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_442">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_975">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The Garda station in Castleisland, County Kerry, is currently housed in rented accommodation at Church Street in that town. It comprises four small rooms, including a public office, a sergeant's office, a dining area and a toilet which is shared by eight gardaí, two sergeants and the public. There is no parking adjacent to the building and it has no holding cells. The station is manned by two sergeants and eight gardaí. A female garda cannot be assigned to the station because of the absence of facilities such as a ladies' toilet. The gardaí attached to the station are divided into four units, each consisting of two members.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">Castleisland Garda station is a sub-district of Killarney and covers an area of about 96 square miles. When Farranfore Garda station is closed, the Castleisland gardaí also cover the Farranfore sub-district, including the villages of Firies and Currow. Due to the fact that the station has no cell accommodation, there are problems at weekends, when there is considerable activity in the town and large numbers of young people congregate there.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">When this results in public disorder, requiring the detention of unruly individuals, the gardaí on duty have no detention facilities in the Castleisland station. Consequently, any detention involves a round trip of at least an hour and a half to Killarney Garda station and, in the meantime, the town is left without a Garda presence, thereby giving rise to further problems. Business people and local residents are very concerned in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">The gardaí in Castleisland are kept particularly busy. Already this year, they have served in the region of 300 summonses and warrants. There are approximately 600 licensed firearms holders in the area who have to be supervised. Detection rates for the penalty points system are very high in this Garda sub-district, which includes part of two national primary roads, the N21 and N22. The station is also responsible for immigration police duties at Farranfore Airport and supervision of explosives procedures at the local John A. Woods quarry.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">On 3 March 2001, the original station was subjected to an arson attack which caused severe smoke damage throughout the building. Portakabin facilities were provided in the yard at the rear of the station to enable the gardaí to maintain a full service at that time. The station staff was subsequently moved to the present rented accommodation at Church Street in August 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">Since then, I have raised this matter through questions in the Dáil on numerous occasions. The customary reply was to the effect that the process of acquiring a site was still ongoing and I was informed that the successful acquisition of a site would ultimately depend on: agreement being reached on an acceptable price; the relative priority accorded to Castleisland by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and availability of sufficient funds to complete the purchase at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">I point out to the Minister of State that before the last general election, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform visited Castleisland, where he met the local development association and other community leaders and promised them that the provision of a Garda station for the town would be a priority for the Government, if re-elected. That is now almost two years ago, but nothing has happened. The local gardaí and the community they serve so well are very anxious that a positive decision be made on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">Numerous sites in Castleisland have been put forward for consideration but, for whatever reason, have been rejected. I understand the Office of Public Works is currently involved in negotiations for a site, not for the first time. On this occasion, I hope the Office of Public Works will purchase the site now on offer. In addition to the current strength of eight gardaí and two sergeants, there is need for a further two gardaí. I understand that approval has been given for such an increase but due to the lack of accommodation, it cannot be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">I urge the Minister of State and his senior colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to take this matter very seriously and to provide the Garda facilities in Castleisland which the local community and their dedicated Garda force deserve. It is inconceivable that in this day and age, Garda duties in such an important sub-district should continue to be conducted from a small rented premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">That situation constitutes a very negative statement about the Minister of State's Department and the Office of Public Works. I appeal to all concerned to make this a top priority.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_985">I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Parlon. I thank Deputy Deenihan for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the acquisition of a site for a new Garda station in Castleisland.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">The current Garda station in Castleisland was badly damaged by fire on 3 March 2001 and the Commissioners of Public Works immediately leased an alternative premises at that time, as a temporary solution pending the provision of a new station. The commissioners assessed a number of sites and properties, following an advertisement campaign in both the national and local newspapers, in an effort to find a permanent solution to the accommodation situation in Castleisland.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">Two sites were deemed suitable for a Garda station by the Office of Public Works. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform also found the sites suitable from an operational point of view. However, the Office of Public Works could not agree terms with the owner of one of the sites at Main Street, Castleisland, as he was seeking a sum well in excess of market value.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">An offer was made to purchase the second preferred site at Tralee Road, Castleisland, and the Commissioners of Public Works are actively negotiating at present to acquire that site. Finalisation of any acquisition will, of course, depend on some uncertain factors, to which reference was made by Deputy Deenihan in his contribution to this Adjournment debate, namely, an acceptable market value being agreed between the owner and the Office of Public Works, the relative priority accorded to Castleisland by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the availability of the necessary funding in the Office of Public Works Vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">In the meantime, the Garda authorities have advised the Commissioners of Public Works that the original Garda station can be disposed of as it is totally unsuitable. The commissioners will proceed to carry out a valuation of the premises.</p>

        <heading>Industrial Disputes.</heading>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_444">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_990">The matter I wish to raise is a very serious one, namely, the industrial relations dispute between, on the one hand, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, on the other hand, the Prison Officers' Association. This has been a protracted dispute, the origins of which go back over a period of many years, with regard to the issue of overtime in the Prison Service. This year, the cost of such overtime amounted to approximately €64 million and the Department wishes to reduce that figure by half.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">I do not believe anybody has a substantial disagreement with that objective, but there is major disagreement as to how to achieve it. The Department has put forward proposals for an annualised system of overtime hours in the Prison Service. Those proposals have been rejected by the Prison Officers' Association on the basis of what is probably the highest rejection ballot ever recorded in the history of industrial disputes, with a 99.4% majority in favour of rejection. That is about as close as one can get to 100%.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">The Prison Officers' Association put forward its proposals which have been checked and audited by the Irish Productivity Centre. The association sets out its proposals in detail, which I will not go through, no more than I will go through the detail of the Minister's proposals. However, the association's proposals come up with a saving of roughly €30 million, which would achieve the same objective. The Minister apparently rejected those proposals out of hand, as has the Irish Prison Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">We find ourselves in a dilemma in that there seems to be no movement forward. It seems that one would deal with an industrial dispute through industrial relations machinery. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has refused to accept that the Prison Officers' Association has the right to have its document on the table and wants his document alone on the table. That seems to be a unilateral interpretation of the manner in which industrial relations is conducted. I understand that congress is anxious that both sides would have their documents on the table and that the negotiating procedure would be fully operated. We have not even got to the first stage of the industrial relations procedure. We still have not got as far as the Labour Relations Commission examining the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">Prison staff and their families, the educational services and the prisoners are caught up in the crossfire. There is a threat by the Minister to close the Curragh Prison, Fort Mitchell Prison on Spike Island and to transfer the use of Loughan House and Shelton Abbey.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_445">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_995">That is a Government decision.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_996">I expect the Minister is not operating purely on an unilateral basis even though he flies many kites. I would have thought that in this case he would have Government backing, whatever that means in practice. The fallout from the closure of these facilities could be substantial. It is interesting that the best rehabilitation and education services that exist in the prison system with the best facilities to deliver on those services are in those prisons. I visited the Curragh Prison last week. I met the staff and the governor of that prison and members of the teaching organisations in all the prisons and listened to what was said. It would be a tragedy if the Minister carried out the threat that he is holding, like the sword of Damocles, over the Prison Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">He wants to get his way and he wants a solution to this dispute. He is seeking to achieve a halving of the overtime bill in the prisons. I would have thought he would be satisfied by whatever mechanism is used once he achieves that objective and that it would not be important whether it is done by way of his proposals or by way of other proposals. Will the Minister of State advise us to what extent progress has been made in this regard and whether this dispute will be allowed go to the Labour Relations Commission?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_447">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_998">I thank Deputy Costello for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. I welcome the fact that Deputy Costello shares the objective of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this matter, to reduce, in general terms, the overall overtime bill, although he has expressed his disagreement with some of the steps being taken to implement that objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The Minister sees merit in the idea of discussions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, but it is important to understand the context of the current impasse between the Prison Officers' Association and the Irish Prison Service to appreciate the basis on which any such discussions can take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Discussions between the Prison Service and the Prison Officers' Association going back some considerable time produced a consensus that the concept of annual hours offered the best prospect of achieving a set of arrangements which would meet the needs of both sides. Management eventually tabled a comprehensive set of proposals for change based on the annual hours concept and on the detailed operations of an expert group, the staffing and operations review team, known as SORT, which produced, over a two-year period, a detailed report in respect of each and every prison and place of detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">Those proposals were the subject of discussions over the summer months. When little or no progress was made, it was agreed to continue the discussions with the assistance of two facilitators, Mr. Bill Attley, a former general secretary of SIPTU and Mr. Joe McGovern, a retired assistant secretary at the Department of Finance. Among the demands tabled by the Prison Officers' Association in the course of those facilitated discussions, was a claim for an increase in basic pay. The management side made clear that an increase in basic pay was not on under the terms of Sustaining Progress and benchmarking, and eventually the Prison Officers' Association agreed to withdraw the pay claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">The management side, in good faith, responded to the withdrawal of the pay claim by offering a number of improvements to its original package of proposals for change. However, despite intensive efforts to get some measure of agreement on the package offered, no progress has been made. The range of demands tabled by the Prison Officers' Association in the course of discussions, if conceded, would have resulted in an even more expensive system than the current overtime system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">The facilitated discussions ended when the facilitators concluded that the gap between the sides was too great to be bridged. Subsequently, management issued its revised proposals for change and the Prison Officers' Association then put those proposals to the membership with a recommendation that they be rejected. The outcome of the ballot was a clear rejection of the management proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">It is important to note that, subsequently, the possibility of inviting the Labour Relations Commission to intervene was mooted by the Irish Prison Service management. The Prison Officers' Association insisted that it would not go to the Labour Relations Commission solely on the basis of the management proposals but would be willing to go that route if it could submit its own set of proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">The Minister's and the Government's assessment of the proposals ultimately put forward by the Prison Officers' Association is already on the record of the House. The Minister has addressed them at length in the course of a number of Adjournment debates in recent days. In a nutshell, the Prison Officers' Association is so far removed from reality that there is simply no point in going to the Labour Relations Commission to seek a compromise solution on the basis of the proposals submitted by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">The pay claim, which the Prison Officers' Association had agreed to drop in the course of the facilitated discussions, was reintroduced as the central element of its proposals. Given that such an increase in basic pay could not be contemplated under the terms of Sustaining Progress and benchmarking, there was simply no way that the Minister could agree to authorise the Irish Prison Service to enter talks, either in the Labour Relations Commission or any other forum, where a proposal involving an increase in basic pay would form part of the discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Apart from the basic pay claim, the proposals put forward by the Prison Officers' Association make no attempt to address the core problem of escalating overtime costs in the Prison Service and the concept of annual hours, which both sides had agreed offered the best way forward, is ignored. It was against this background that the Minister was left with no option but to bring to Government a set of proposals which, in the absence of agreement, would achieve the level of efficiencies that are required to ensure a reasonable and sustainable cost structure for the Prison Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">An industrial dispute in the Prison Service is the last thing the Minister or his Cabinet colleagues want. He has no desire to close or even mothball prisons or to turn over management control of our open centres at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey to another organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">His clear preference is for an agreed solution which would be good for both management and staff and for the persons entrusted to the care of the Prison Service. However, if a solution cannot be reached by consensus, the Minister will have no choice but to proceed in the new year with the alternative cost reduction measures approved by the Government on 11 November 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">Deputies will also be aware of recent media reports concerning the payment of benchmarking awards to prison officers and other groups. I take this opportunity to make it clear that there has been no decision to refuse the 1 January benchmarking payments to prison officers. What is at issue is the temporary deferral by the justice performance verification group of consideration of whether to recommend payment of the increases in question in light of the fluid nature of the current situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">There is still a window of opportunity between now and the end of the year to reach agreement on the way forward. The Minister met representatives of the Prison Officers' Association last Thursday to discuss the impasse and I understand that it was generally a positive meeting. The Minister very much hopes that the short time left will be used by the Prison Officers' Association to enter meaningful discussions and conclude agreement on the way forward.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnEllis" eId="spk_448">
          <from>Mr. Ellis</from>
          <p eId="para_1012">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the problems that will be experienced in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, if a proposed withdrawal of its fire fighting service takes place next Sunday night. I raise this matter because a number of fire fighters attached to the Ballinamore station have been issued with notice of termination of their employment on age grounds. However, the firefighters claim that they are not tied into the agreement and recommendations that were made to retain firefighters, issued in April 2003, because they had joined the firefighting service prior to the date of this agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">Of most concern is that an area will be left without a fire service. If there was an emergency, such as a fire or road accident, in the area, the nearest available firefighting service is either in Mohill, Drumshanbo or Carrick-on-Shannon, all considerable distances from Ballinamore. Residents from the town, and surrounding areas, believe it is imperative that the service is retained by whatever necessary means. I had discussions with both the management and members of the county council who want to see this issue resolved. If the closure goes ahead an area will be left without a fire service and dangers to life which cannot be tolerated. Closure of the station is not in the best interests of the fire service or the beneficiaries of it. Will the Minister inform us what he will do to deal with this matter?</p>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_1014">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue to which I am replying on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, who is abroad on official business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">Leitrim County Council has assured the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that there is no threat of withdrawal of the fire service in Ballinamore at this time. The issue in Ballinamore arises from the implementation of the findings of an expert review group on the retirement age for firemen. I understand that three firefighters in Ballinamore, the station officer and two drivers, who are over the age limit set by the expert group are seeking to continue in employment. This is a matter which has to be resolved at local authority level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">Arising from a Labour Court recommendation and subsequent negotiations, a binding agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board, representing the local authorities, SIPTU and the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union, representing retained firefighters, to establish an expert group to review the retirement age of retained firefighters, which has been set at 55 years of age since 1985. It was agreed that the findings of the expert group would be binding on the parties and would have to be accepted and implemented by both the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The expert group issued its findings on 16 April 2003. Under these findings, the preferred retirement age of firefighters remains at 55 years. However, firefighters should have the option to continue working up to age 58 years, provided they apply to the local authority and pass an occupational health test each year. Any firefighter who does not have a written contract of employment with a higher retirement age may not be employed beyond the age of 58 years. Local authorities were advised by circular from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 24 November that the new arrangements should be put in place immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">The health and safety of both firefighters and the victims of fires has to be the primary concern to both management and unions and this has been at the centre of the review carried out by the expert group. It is essential that the new arrangements be implemented by all local authorities. Since the enactment of the Health and Safety Act 1989, local authorities have a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk. To allow firemen to work beyond the age recommended by the expert group would be irresponsible and could leave a local authority open to legal action in the event of injury or death either of a firefighter or of a victim of an incident.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">There has at the same time been a significant improvement in the level of retirement gratuity which is now available to those retiring from the service. This has gone from three times the annual retainer to four times. In cash terms, this means that a station officer with 32 years' service will receive more than €55,000, while a driver will get almost €42,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">The review of the retirement age was carried out on foot of a binding agreement between the parties. There can be no going back on that agreement at this stage and it falls on everybody to abide by the terms of the expert group's findings.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1021">I thank the Leas-Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment and the Minister for attending. This issue is one that would be dear to any Minister's heart. It is a case of an award made in 1976 for an occupational injury suffered in 1970. In the assessment of the award at the time, it was determined that the individual had a loss of 20% faculty of which 10% was attributable to the occupational injury. I do not know how expert the medical advice of the time was, but if diagnosis could be as accurate every day, medical science would be more outstanding than others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The Minister and I know that the replies to these questions are written. However, I am asking that this case be re-examined and the medical evidence be tested because at an appeal to the Department in 1999 the appeals officer stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The appellant was awarded 10% disablement pension in respect of loss of faculty due to an occupational accident in 1970. He sought a review of this award on the basis that his condition has deteriorated since the date of the award. He was examined by a medical referee for the Department and found to have a loss of faculty amounting to 20%. However, it was considered that the increase in the loss of faculty of 10% was not attributable to the occupational accident he originally sustained but was related to the onset of osteoarthritis loss of hearing and anxiety. Having considered the evidence submitted, including that adduced at an oral hearing of the case, I do not consider that it has been clearly established that the deterioration in his condition, i.e. the increased loss of faculty was related to his occupational injury in 1970.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">That is a profound judgment and I am sure the Minister recognises it as such. I challenge it because, if one has an injury to the spine or a limb, it can trigger arthritic conditions, which is the case in this instance. I do not know how it was determined that both conditions could not be related. There is no evidence that can tell with such accuracy, as in this case, that loss of faculty is not related to an accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Following representations I made to the Department, a further appeal was opened. The appeals officer on this occasion was nearly as good as the previous one. It was also disallowed on the basis that:</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">All the available evidence has been considered. It has not been established that the deterioration in the appellant's overall condition is directly related to his occupational injury in 1970.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">I am not asking the Minister to carry out a medical examination. If the Ceann Comhairle were present, he could shed more light on the subject. However, the appellant has medical evidence that his current condition is directly related to the accident that took place in 1970. Will the Minister have the case tested again?</p>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_1054">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 179 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I introduced the CLÁR programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to annual funding for the CLÁR programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census data. The Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CLÁR programme and I announced these on 17 January last. Areas in 18 counties are now included in the programme and there is no plan to make any further changes to the boundary of CLÁR areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">CLÁR funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These measures support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health, broadband and sports projects. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">The measures were agreed with and are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments, State agencies or public utilities, as appropriate. This ensures efficiency and effectiveness and meets the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas. I intend to continue this practice for any new measures I may introduce, depending on needs identified. Equally, I will keep under review the operation of existing measures.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_68">The merits of this practice are reflected in the successful delivery of the programme. In 2002, expenditure amounted to €14.14 million, which, it is estimated, levered out a further €10.5 million in related public and private expenditure. With the 2003 provision of €9.517 million fully committed, the programme is injecting investment into the areas which otherwise would have been bottom of the list for infrastructure investment. The provision for 2004 is €10.74 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">With the ongoing co-operation of other Departments, State agencies and public utilities, the programme will continue to deliver on the commitment of supporting rural communities.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1069">The Deputy will be aware from my Department's strategy statement that the sectors-associated goals of the Department may be categorised under four headings: supporting community and local development by facilitating communities, with a special focus on areas of disadvantage, to pursue social and economic progress in their areas; tackling drug misuse by securing a more integrated and co-ordinated response by State agencies in tackling drug misuse; promoting rural, Gaeltacht and islands development by supporting living and working populations in these areas and fostering sustainable and culturally vibrant communities; and supporting the use of the Irish language in Gaeltacht areas and promoting the use of the language throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">The Deputy will appreciate that as the statement of strategy covers a three year period, my Department's priorities will adjust over time. This will happen as various objectives are achieved, or when intervening developments argue for sensible refocusing. Priorities at this time include community and local development, ensuring sustained and enhanced targeting of resources towards disadvantaged communities, achieving improved coherence across local and community development structures and reform of the law relating to charities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">Tackling drugs misuse is another priority with the continuing the implementation of the national drugs strategy, including implementing the plans of the local drugs task forces, overseeing the development of the regional drugs task forces and completing the research programme of the NACD. In this context, the drugs strategy will be reviewed in 2004, which will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_76">My Department has also set as a priority the advancing the development agenda in rural, Gaeltacht and islands areas and initiating a range of initiatives at EU and national level designed to improve infrastructure, services and employment opportunities.

          <p eId="para_1081">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 38 and 79 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">As I have already outlined to the House in my reply to Priority Question No. 2 on 27 November 2003, a total of €5.8 million has been provided in my Department's Vote for 2004, under a new subhead for the RAPID programme. The breakdown of this amount is €4.5 million for capital expenditure and €1.3 million for current expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">I have stated on occasions in the past, many of the proposals from RAPID plans have been sent to Departments for consideration, when it would be much more efficient for them to be dealt with at local level. To this end, a dedicated fund of €4.5 million has been set aside for capital expenditure for the RAPID programme to support such projects. This funding will be used as leverage money to facilitate co-funding from State agencies. I hope to make an announcement shortly on the precise way in which the money will be spent, but as I have previously stated, area implementation teams will be involved in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">The €1.3 million current funding will be provided to ADM to meet administration expenses and to provide support to area implementation teams.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1086">The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, recently launched its annual report for 2003 on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union and Norway.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">The report found that after cannabis, amphetamines and ecstasy are the second most commonly used illicit drugs in Europe. In this context, use in Ireland over the last 12 months was reported as high and being just under 5% in the 15 to 34 year old age group. However, the Deputy should note that the data reported in relation to ecstasy use in Ireland is primarily based on the 1998 SLÁN survey.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">I recently launched results from the first drug prevalence survey in Ireland. This survey was undertaken jointly by the national advisory committee on drugs, for which my Department has responsibility, and the drug and alcohol information and research unit in Northern Ireland. It provides solid statistical information and up-to-date figures on drug use in Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_82">As part of the survey, a total of 8,442 people were interviewed between October 2002 and April 2003 in line with EMCDDA guidelines. The survey reported ecstasy usage in the last year in the 15 to 34 year old age bracket at 2.2% and at 1.1% for 15 to 64 year old group. Although this level of usage is still of concern, it shows Ireland to be more in line with European norms.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">In general, the drug prevalence survey found that the vast majority of the general population have never used any illegal drugs and that a relatively small percentage is currently using illegal drugs. However, we are aware that drug use – including ecstasy – continues to do much harm in society and the Government is determined to continue tackling it through the on-going implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1090">My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in 1999. The policy agenda is a broad one, involving the remit of many of my colleagues in Government and their related agencies. It covers such issues as agriculture, infrastructure, transport, environment, health and education and the challenge is to ensure coherence in pursuing our rural development objectives. This policy area is kept under active review particularly in the light of ongoing economic and social changes and in the context of a changing EU perspective for the support of rural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">In the case of my Department, there is a wide range of programmes and supports for rural communities, details of which are set out in the following appendix.</p>
          <p class="Center" eId="para_1092">APPENDIX</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_84">Leader+ and Leader National Rural Development ProgrammeIn the case of my Department, the Leader+ programme is an EU initiative designed to encourage the implementation of integrated, high-quality and innovative strategies in rural communities. The initiative is delivered by 22 local action groups. The allocation for Leader+ for the period 2000 to 2006 is €73.6 million and the initiative is co-funded by the EU. The Leader national rural development programme closely complements the Leader+ initiative. It is operated by 13 local groups in areas of the country not covered by Leader+. It also provides nationwide coverage for rural and agricultural tourism and focuses more on mainstream activities. Again, an element of innovation is required for all activities funded. The allocation for 2000 to 2006 is €75.7 million, again co-funded by the EU.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">PEACE, INTERREG and Farm Relief ServicesMy Department's responsibilities also include the rural development aspects of the joint cross-Border programmes PEACE and INTERREG as well as the farm relief services measure of the national development plan. The rural measures under these programmes aim to foster the economic and social development of rural communities. Projects supported by the programmes are community based, and also include activities related to on farm diversification.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">Total funding of €7.351 million is being provided under the rural development measures of the PEACE II programme during the period 2000-2004. Support is available for cross border community development and the development of agri-diversification projects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">Under the INTERREG Ireland-Northern Ireland rural initiative measure support is available to rural businesses and communities to engage in developing the economic and social sustainability of the region and to promote the development and expansion of cross-Border businesses through integrated local area based projects with a strategic focus in geographically defined areas of rural disadvantage. Total funding of €18 million is being provided for the period 2000-2006.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">Total funding of €10 million is being provided under the rural initiative measure of the joint INTERREG Ireland/Wales programme for the period 2000-2006. Under the programme support is being provided in the eligible area for joint projects promoting rural business skills, rural tourism, rural health and on and off farm diversification to complement agricultural activities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">In addition my Department provides funding to the farm relief services of €8 million under the two regional operation programmes of the national development plan 2000-2006. The funding is provided largely for training with element of infrastructure and research and development.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">Local Development Social Inclusion ProgrammeThe local development social inclusion programme provides funding to 38 partnership companies, 33 community groups and four employment pacts to deliver the programme at local level. Rural communities would be among the beneficiaries of this programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">Other Community ProgrammesMy Department supports local self-help and community development initiatives targeted at disadvantaged communities in both rural and urban areas nationwide, in recognition of the role that voluntary groups have in facilitating local communities to address the problems facing them. This support is made available through a range of grant schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">Applications for the scheme of grants for locally based community and voluntary organisations and scheme of community support to older people for his year are currently being assessed and successful applicant groups will be notified over the next few weeks.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">On an ongoing basis, my Department also supports some 170 locally based projects nationwide, which are involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in both rural and urban communities. This support is provided by way of core-funding through the community development support programmes with the funding targeted specifically at disadvantaged communities. I intend to continue supporting these schemes in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">In September, I announced funding of some €7.4 million over the coming three years for community and voluntary organisations under the scheme of grants for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector and under the funding scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">These schemes will provide funding to 58 community groups from all regions of the country. My officials are currently in contact with all the successful applicants and funding will be made available to individual groups as soon as contracts have been agreed with the groups concerned.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">CLÁRI introduced the CLÁR programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. Areas in 18 counties have been selected under this programme including areas I announced last January in honouring the commitment in the agreed programme for Government to review the areas in light of the 2002 population census results. These areas suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 2002 with an average population loss of 50%. The exception is the Cooley Peninsula, which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas that I consulted at the outset. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure through a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health and sports projects. They are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments or public utilities, as appropriate, thus ensuring efficiency and effectiveness as well as meeting the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">Rural Development FundI am interested in assessing the effects of placing development workers in rural communities as a method of expediting rural development and reducing poverty. For this purpose, I announced funding in May 2002 for four pilot schemes which are aimed at testing the success of development workers in regenerating particularly disadvantaged rural areas. These projects are operating through a variety of community-based initiatives. They are intended to help reduce rural deprivation in the long-term at a low cost to the State by creating sustainable development. The initiative is being supported from the rural development fund of my Department. The purpose of the fund is to finance research, evaluation and pilot actions to provide information and advice for policy makers on important rural development issues.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">Review of Rural Enterprise SupportI recently announced that Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, have been appointed to carry out a review of enterprise support in rural areas. This review will analyse official enterprise support, including tourism enterprise, already available in rural areas. The way in which existing supports are delivered will be examined with particular regard to EU state aid law, the national spatial strategy and Exchequer financial constraints. The number and roles of agencies needed will be reviewed to optimise enterprise development in rural areas and yet avoid unnecessary duplication.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">Western Development CommissionIn addition, my Department funds the Western Development Commission, whose functions include promoting, fostering and encouraging economic and social development in the western region and the operation of the western investment fund. Activities include policy analysis and development which feed in turn into policy development and planning in my Department. At my request, the commission is developing a strategy for towns on radial routes in its region to maximise the benefits of the national spatial strategy, major roads investment, the strategic rail review and decentralisation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">Gaeltacht SchemesUnder the Gaeltacht improvement schemes grants are payable for the improvement of Gaeltacht roads, non-national, accommodation and bog roads, and village renewal; provision of water and sewage schemes; the development of strategic and small piers and harbours in Gaeltacht areas; the provision and improvement of facilities, such as community centres, sports fields and other leisure facilities; Gaeltacht housing; and social and cultural activities in the Gaeltacht which are central to the maintenance of the Irish language as the chosen language of the region.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_101">By improving the infrastructure, these grants are aimed at adding to the social, cultural and economic life of the Gaeltacht areas, as well as strengthening the Irish language as the community language within such areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_102">Údarás na Gaeltachta discharges its responsibilities through a range of socio-economic activities in the Gaeltacht, received a total of €42.9 million from my Department last year to allow it to continue with the development of the Gaeltacht economy and the preservation of the Irish language. In terms of advancing rural development generally both at EU and national level, my Department is availing of a range of opportunities through EU conferences, the rural development forum, etc., to advance the policy options necessary to meet changing rural agenda.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_103">IslandsMy Department implements comprehensive Island development policies. A sum of €10,000 is provided in next years estimates for this purpose.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1096">I have made clear my view that a local community-based approach is the way forward where issues of access to the countryside arise. I established the consultation group on access to waymarked ways in April 2003 to consider the issues that had arisen in relation to access to some waymarked ways following the cessation of payments to landowners under the REP scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">The consultation group includes representatives from the farming organisations, tourism marketing bodies and recreational users of the countryside and has met on three occasions to consider the issues involved. It continues to examine all aspects of the issue, including options such as the development of sustainable walking routes to the mutual benefit of landowners-farmers and recreational users of the countryside. Progress reports on the work of the consultation group have been made to each meeting of the rural agri-tourism advisory group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">The consultation group is currently considering aspects relating to the establishment of a countryside recreation forum or network. As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 150 on 21 October, I understand that it is planned that the consultation group will report back to the rural-agri-tourism advisory group in January. I will consider, further, what actions should be taken, including the question of publication of any report, when the group's consideration of this question has been completed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1116">In July 2000, I approved a grant of €1.84 million to Mayo County Council for the provision of a cable car and associated services between Inishbiggle and the mainland at Bullsmouth.

        <summary eId="sum_110">It was hoped that construction of the cable car would have commenced in 2002 and that the service would be fully operational by the spring of this year. However, a delay was incurred as a result of an objection lodged with An Bord Pleanála against one of the compulsory purchase orders in respect of the land required for the project. While An Bord Pleanála subsequently confirmed the said compulsory purchase orders, this decision was the subject of an application for a High Court judicial review earlier this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_111">A settlement between Mayo County Council and the applicants led to the withdrawal of the application for a judicial review. Mayo County Council subsequently sought my approval to proceed with the acquisition of land and to prepare contract documents for the project.

          <p eId="para_1124">At the National Rural Development Forum on 7 November 2003 I gave a brief outline of my vision for the future of rural development in a European Union context. I noted that despite investment through a range of programmes both at EU and national level, rural Europe has continued to decline. I stated that if we are serious about rural development, there is a need at a European level for a radical new approach to rural policies with a much broader agenda than heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">Given that I am the first senior Minister in Ireland with a special rural development remit, and in the context of the enlargement of the European Union, I said I believed that it is absolutely vital that Ireland take a proactive part in shaping the European agenda towards rural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">Such policies should, in my view, include recognition that rural areas must have multi-dimensional development policies and recognition that a total dependence on agriculture will not sustain the population in rural areas; clear spatial strategies, ensuring the continued maintenance and growth of rural populations; targeted funding for rural areas as a matter of urgency to ensure that infrastructure deficits in roads, telecommunications, water, public transport etc. do not inhibit rural growth – these funds in particular need to be targeted at declining and peripheral areas; provision that EU competition law does not operate in such a way that the provision of essential services becomes prohibitively expensive in rural areas; and recognition that enterprise support mechanisms need to ensure that rural areas can compete for enterprise development.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_114">I announced at the forum that two major conferences relating to rural Ireland are to be held during the Irish Presidency of the EU. Islands, mountainous and sparsely populated areas form the subject of the first conference to be held in Galway in May. Themes will cover how the EU will deal with structural and geographic handicaps in the new Europe and how to ensure development of island, mountainous and sparsely populated areas. The second conference will address a wide range of rural development issues and will be held in Westport, County Mayo from 31 May to 1 June.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_115">These conferences are being held at a crucial time when the post-2006 EU funding scenario is being developed.

          <p eId="para_1134">As the Deputies will be aware, subhead L in my Department's Vote for 2004 provides an amount of €42.2 million for local development and social inclusion measures. While the amount in this subhead in 2003 was €44.662 million, it should be noted that the provision in 2003 included a budget of €1.5 million to support the implementation of the RAPID programme. Therefore the real reduction in subhead L in 2004 is 2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">This €1.5 million for RAPID in 2003 was not available for individual projects in RAPID areas but was provided to ADM to meet administration expenses and to provide support to RAPID area implementation teams.

          <p eId="para_1142">I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 40 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The young peoples facilities and services fund, YPFSF, was established in 1998 to assist in the development of facilities – including sport and recreational facilities – and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is primarily preventative in nature in that it seeks to divert "at risk" young people away from the dangers of substance abuse, as opposed to the provision of treatment services for drug misusers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">To date, the main focus of the fund has been in the 14 local drugs task force, LDTF, areas and four urban areas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow, where a serious drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. To date, more than €59 million has been allocated under the fund to support approximately 350 projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The national assessment committee, NAC, for the fund, which is chaired by my Department, is currently considering a number of strategic issues relating to the fund and in this context, the committee recently met each of the development groups. Among the issues discussed were the completion of round 1 facility projects and the staffing and management of the bigger scale facilities; and the mainstreaming of round 1 services projects, which have been successfully evaluated, thereby ensuring their continued funding by the relevant statutory agencies; and their priorities for round 2 of the fund.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_116">The NAC is further considering these issues with a view to making recommendations to the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion in early 2004 particularly on round 2 allocations. An amount of €33.5 million has been allocated in my Department's Estimates for 2004 to fund a range of drugs initiatives, including the YPFSF. This represents a 5% increase in the funding provided in 2003 and clearly confirms the Government's ongoing and sustained commitment to tackling the problem of drug misuse in Ireland. I am confident the funding allocated in the 2004 Estimates will allow for the valuable work being undertaken under the fund to be consolidated and expanded in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_117">There are no plans at present to extend the fund beyond local drugs task force areas and the urban areas referred to above. However, the matter will be kept under review, particularly in the light of ongoing work being done by the regional drugs task forces. The task forces are currently working on mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas, as well as the services already available in the areas, with a view to co-ordinating existing services and addressing gaps in service provision.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_118">The dormant accounts disbursement plan provides that over the first year of the plan, the total allocation under the economic and social disadvantage heading will be for the purposes of assisting programmes or projects within RAPID, CLÁR and drugs task force areas. In subsequent years, those areas will receive not less than half of the annual allocation under this heading. It is open to organisations, groups, etc. which satisfy the criteria to make applications for funding under the scheme which was advertised in the national press on Friday, 21 November 2003.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1155">As the Deputy is aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The strategy contains 100 individual actions under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_125">Since it was launched in May 2001, Departments and agencies have made considerable progress in implementing the actions set out for them in the strategy. Six monthly progress reports on the strategy are provided to the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion and it is intended to submit a further progress report to the committee in the first half of the new year. In terms of progress to date, it should be noted that considerable progress is also being made as regards increasing the number of methadone treatment places. The number of places at the end of August 2003, the latest date for which confirmed figures are available, was 6,805. The equivalent figure at the end of 2000 was 5,032. The Department of Health and Children launched the first phase of a national awareness campaign on 15 May. The campaign features television and radio advertising supported by an information brochure and website, all designed to promote greater awareness and communication about the drugs issue in Ireland. This first phase targeted the general population while the second phase, launched in October, is aimed at parents. Co-ordinators and chairs have been appointed in all of the regional drugs task force areas and most are now up and running and meeting regularly. They are currently working on mapping out the patterns of drug misuse as well as services already available in their areas with a view to co-ordinating these existing services and addressing gaps in service provision. Customs and Excise have launched a coastal watch programme and implemented a number of measures to enhance drugs detection capability at points of entry. Guidelines to assist schools in the development of a drugs policy have also been developed and were issued to all primary and post-primary schools in May 2002. The Department of Education and Science implemented substance misuse prevention programmes in all schools in the local drugs task force areas during the academic year 2001-02 and the social personal and health programme has been on the curricula of all primary and secondary schools since September 2003. This work is being supported by the SPHE support service, which has recruited additional trainers and support officers. Over 1,100 recovering drug misusers are now special FÁS community employment schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_126">The strategy also provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by end-2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_127">My Department also has overall responsibility for the work of the local drugs task forces, LTDFs, which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. There are 14 LDTFs – 12 in Dublin, one in Cork, and one in Bray. Over €14.5 million has been allocated to the task forces to implement their second round of action plans. The Deputy should also note that over €11.6 million has been allocated to projects under the premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in LDTF areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">In addition, over €59 million has been allocated under the young peoples facilities and services fund. The main aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1174">The fifth meeting of the National Rural Development Forum took place on 7 November 2003 in Cashel, County Tipperary. The programme for the forum included a progress report on the White Paper on rural development and the CLÁR programme, a presentation on disability issues in a rural context by the Disability Federation of Ireland, a progress report on the study of supports for enterprise in rural areas and the Leader mid-term review. This was followed by workshops to discuss the principles and challenges for rural development. The outcome of the workshops was discussed in a plenary session of the forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">The forum was established to debate current issues, review existing programmes and identify suitable policy responses to rural problems. Its membership is broadly representative of Departments, State agencies, the social partners and the wider voluntary and community sector. The forum, therefore, provides an opportunity for various actors involved in rural development to voice ideas about the way forward. The outcome of the deliberations of the forum will feed into policy review in the area of rural development which is particularly timely in the context of ongoing EU reforms. A date for the next forum has not yet been set, but I expect it to be in mid-2004.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1177">The National Advisory Committee on Drugs, for which my Department has responsibility, published a study on the prevalence of opiate misuse in Ireland last May. It estimated that there were 14,452 opiate users in Ireland in 2001, the latest date for which figures are available. This estimate is based on statistics provided by three data sources which include the central drug treatment list, Garda data and hospital in-patient data. As this was the first formal estimate of the number of opiate users undertaken since 1996, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with a breakdown for each of the past five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">The 1996 study, which put the number of opiate users at 13,461, estimated prevalence in Dublin only. The latest study estimates that there are 12,456 opiate users in Dublin with a further 2,225 users outside the capital. The Deputy should note that the Dublin and outside Dublin figures do not add up to the national total as all three figures are the result of separate statistical calculations which are performed independently of each other. The Deputy will agree that the drop in prevalence figures in Dublin since 1996 is encouraging. Equally encouraging is the finding that the numbers of users in the 15 to 24 year old bracket has reduced substantially which may point to a lower rate of initiation into heroin misuse. The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country and contains 100 individual actions under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. These actions are to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">Under the treatment pillar of the strategy, the Deputy should note that since 1996 the availability of treatment for opiate dependence has increased very significantly. This may be a factor in explaining the latest estimates. In relation to methadone, for example, there were 1,350 places available on the central methadone treatment list at the start of 1996, whereas, currently there are approximately 6,800. While many of the study's findings are encouraging, we cannot afford any degree of complacency. The Government remains committed to working in partnership with communities most affected by drug misuse and the continued implementation of the 100 actions set out in the national drug strategy to counteract drug use including heroin, remains a top priority.</p>

          <p eId="para_1181">I attended the conference on rural development in Salzburg from 12 to 14 November. The themes of the conference were planting seeds for rural futures and building a policy that can deliver our ambitions. There were some 1,000 delegates in attendance from current and accession member states including Ministers with responsibility for agriculture and rural development. The report of the conclusions of the conference outlined a number of principles which should guide future rural development policy. The principles state that a living countryside is essential for farming as agricultural activity is essential for a living countryside. The principles also relate to the preservation of the diversity of Europe's countryside, the competitiveness of the farming sector, rural development policy which will apply in all rural areas of the enlarged EU, serve the needs of broader society in rural areas and be implemented in partnership between public and private organisations and civil society in line with the principle of subsidiarity. Greater responsibility will be given to programme partnerships. It was also a principle developed at the conference that a significant simplification of EU rural development policy was both necessary and urgent. Delivery must be based on one programming, financing and control system tailored to the needs of rural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">I echoed my approval of the Salzburg conference at the National Rural Development Forum in Cashel on 7 November. At this event, I referred to the need for Ireland to take a pro-active part in shaping the European agenda towards rural development. I also said that such policies should recognise that rural areas must have multi-dimensional development policies. A total dependence on agriculture will not sustain the population in rural areas. Clear spatial strategies are needed to ensure the continued maintenance and growth of rural populations. There must be targeted funding for rural areas as a matter of urgency to ensure that infrastructure deficits in roads, telecommunications, water and public transport do not inhibit rural growth. These funds must be targeted at declining and peripheral areas. We must ensure that EU competition law does not operate to make the provision of essential services prohibitively expensive in rural areas. We must recognise that enterprise support mechanisms are needed to ensure rural areas can compete for enterprise development. I am pleased with the broad conversance of many of the conclusions of Salzburg with these concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">The conclusions of the Salzburg conference will help shape EU policies in this area until 2006 and will help inform our policy agenda in a national context also.</p>

          <p eId="para_1185">The Deputy will be aware that the Official Languages Act 2003, which was enacted in July 2003, was one of the key recommendations contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta. This Act and its implementation will address many of the issues raised in the report, particularly in relation to the provision of improved public services through Irish and the status of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht. In order to progress the full implementation of the legislation, I have allocated €500,000 in my Department's Estimates for 2004 to allow for the establishment of the office of the Coimisinéir Teanga. The Deputy will also be aware that I established an advisory committee to advise on the actions necessary to facilitate the practical implementation, where appropriate, of the various recommendations contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">To provide for the implementation, where appropriate, of those recommendations, an additional €890,000, which represents an increase of 14% over 2003, has been set aside in 2004. These measures to be implemented include community-based language planning, the further development of third level education provision through the medium of Irish in the Gaeltacht, the implementation of changes in certain departmental schemes, namely, Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, Scéim na gCúntóirí Teanga and Scéim na gCampaí Samhraidh, the commissioning of a comprehensive linguistic study of Irish language usage in the Gaeltacht and the implementation of a targeted language awareness campaign focused on inter-generational transmission of the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">Other issues and initiatives being progressed or under consideration include the submission highlighting critical issues affecting the Irish language in primary and post-primary education in the Gaeltacht. This submission was forwarded to An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta in May 2003. Also being considered are submissions on the linguistic impact of planning policy in the Gaeltacht which were made by my Department to local authorities responsible for Gaeltacht areas. These relate to the preparation and implementation of county development plans and local area development plans. There are also proposals for the re-structuring of Irish language pre-school services in the Gaeltacht administered by Údarás na Gaeltachta, which are nearing completion.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_141">Many of these measures emphasise the importance of adopting language centred initiatives. An additional €1 million has been allocated to further enable Údarás na Gaeltachta to implement the relevant recommendations contained in the Coimisiún's report, as appropriate, particularly in relation to pre-school education, youth services and the role of the Gaeltacht co-operatives. Recommendations contained in the report on the role and structure of Údarás na Gaeltachta are also being discussed with the organisation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_142">It should be recognised that the successful outcome of the overall process is largely dependent on the co-operation and commitment of all who have a stake in the future of Irish as the chosen language in Gaeltacht areas.

          <p eId="para_1194">I refer the Deputy to Questions No. 432 of 3 December 2002 and Question Nos. 433 and 434 of 27 May 2003 in which I set out details of the many schemes and initiatives operated by my Department to assist rural and urban communities. In addition, I can inform the Deputy that the local development social inclusion programme is providing financial support to 38 partnership companies, 33 community groups and four employment pacts. The provision for the programme in 2004 is €42.2 million. The comparable adjusted figure for 2003 is €43.3 million. A total funding of €150 million is being provided for the Leader programme for the period 2000 to 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">In accordance with the bottom-up philosophy of rural development, the local Leader group is the decision-making authority in respect of the approval grants. Decisions are made within detailed operating rules drawn up by the Department and approved by the EU Commission. The CLÁR programme funds 22 measures ranging from local road improvements to village enhancement and sports capital grants. These measures are generally implemented on a co-funding basis with local authorities or other official agencies. The 2003 provision is €9.517 million. It will rise to €10.74 million in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">The rural development fund also assists community groups. A total of €950,000 has been provided for the fund in the 2003 and 2004 Estimates. The scheme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations will provide funding of €2.356 million in 2003 to several hundred community groups. There is an inclusion of €2.4 million in the 2004 Estimates for the scheme. The scheme of community support to older people will provide support for up to 9,000 elderly people this year. There is provision of €2.4 million in the Estimates for 2004 for this scheme. Community development support programmes will provide €21.24 million in 2003 to support 170 locally-based projects involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in both rural and urban communities. In the 2004 Estimates €21.046 million has been allocated to these programmes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_145">In September, I announced funding of some €7.4 million over the coming three years for 58 community and voluntary organisations. The funds will be made available under the scheme of grants for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector and under the funding scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in the community and voluntary sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146">My Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces in Dublin, Cork and Bray. It also funds the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects. In 2003, the amount available to fund these initiatives, as well as the national advisory committee on drugs, was €16.16 million. In 2003, €15.88 million was allocated to young people's facilities and services fund development groups based in the 14 local drugs task forces areas as well as Carlow, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. In 2004, the allocation for the combined subhead for these drugs initiatives will be €33.5 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_147">In 2003, €20.9 million was provided for schemes to benefit communities in Gaeltacht areas, including road improvement, marine works, group water schemes, leisure facilities and cultural initiatives. The amount provided in the 2004 Estimates is €21.5 million. A total provision of €8.479 million has been allocated to the islands division of my Department in 2003. While much of this allocation is in grants for capital works, an amount of €179,916 has been paid to date this year to fund four community groups. In 2004, it is estimated that €200,000 will be funded to such groups from a total allocation of €10 million. My Department has also allocated €500,000 to the INTERREG Ireland and Northern Ireland programmes in 2004 while €1.5 million has been provided to the PEACE II initiative.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1198">As outlined in my response to Question No. 135 on 21 October 2003, my Department, in partnership with Údarás na Gaeltachta, is continuing to actively examine the recommendations of the working group on the creation of employment in the Gaeltacht. The aim is to determine how they can be most effectively implemented. Arising from the report, Údarás na Gaeltachta has formulated an action plan to tackle the significant unemployment problem in the north west Donegal Gaeltacht. A key objective of the plan is to approve 200 jobs per annum for the Gaoth Dobhair area with the aim of achieving peak employment in five years. I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that, according to Údarás na Gaeltachta, the objective of 200 job approvals has been already realised for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">Extra staff resources in Údarás have been assigned to the Donegal Gaeltacht and a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter Quinn has been formed to assist in the implementation of the action plan. The initiatives being pursued by Údarás na Gaeltachta include targeting new sectors of the economy, upgrading building and telecommunications infrastructure and the placing of greater emphasis on high skills and the resources of the Gaeltacht including the Irish language. In this regard I mention Údarás na Gaeltachta's new scheme, Fiontraíocht Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, which was launched this year to support the recommendations of the working group. A number of third level educational courses through the medium of Irish are being provided by the National University of Ireland, Galway, in Gaoth Dobhair with the support of Údarás na Gaeltachta. This very positive development is in line with the recommendations of the working group.</p>

I am pleased to report that progress has been made in this regard recently and, on that basis, I intend to provide an allocation for enterprise projects on the non-Gaeltacht islands in my Department's Estimates for 2004. I hope to be in a position to announce details of the new fund in the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1216">As I said in my previous reply, I am confident that through the implementation of the 100 actions in the national drugs strategy 2001-08 and through projects and initiatives operated through the local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund, the problem of cocaine use can be addressed. Each of the local drugs task forces has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in their area based on their own identified priorities. In total, approximately 500 projects have been approved between both rounds of action plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">These projects provide a range of services in the areas of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation aimed at targeting the misuse of a number of different drugs, including cocaine. We have to be aware that many drug users engage in poly-drug use and, therefore, services should be able to address this pattern of usage rather than concentrating on one drug to the exclusion of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">In regard to treatment, as the Deputy will be aware, there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and I am advised that existing services, such as counselling and behavioural therapy, are the best treatments available. In this context, it should be noted that the three area health boards of the Eastern Regional Health Authority have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in the last number of years. In addition, the Northern Area Health Board has established a treatment clinic dedicated to cocaine misuse in the north inner city.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">I assure the Deputy that I will keep the matter of cocaine use under close and ongoing review. Furthermore, it should be noted that the strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by end 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a refocusing of the strategy, if necessary. The need to amend the strategy to reflect changing patterns of drug use will be considered in that context.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_154">Regional drug task forces have been established in each health board area. As a first step in the process of developing action plans, the task forces are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas and the level and range of existing services. Where cocaine use is found to be a problem, this can reflected in the measures proposed in their actions plans.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1236">I propose to take Question Nos. 72 and 81 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">As the Deputies are aware, under the National Drugs Strategy 2001 to 2008, regional drug task forces – RDTFs – are being established in each of the ten health board areas throughout the country. The RDTFs, which represent a team-based response to illicit drug use, are made up of nominees from State agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sector and elected public representatives. It is intended that all the RDTFs will work in a partnership manner, similar to the local drugs task forces – LDTFs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">All RDTFs now have chairpersons and co-ordinators appointed and the majority are up and running and meeting regularly. They are currently working on mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas, as well as the services already available in the areas, with a view to co-ordinating existing services and addressing gaps in service provision. As the Deputies will appreciate, the task forces are at different stages in this process and it will ultimately be a matter for each of them to decide whether to publish the results of this work. It is worth noting, however, that the LDTF plans have, typically, not been published but were available to any interested parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">The work by the regional drugs task forces will feed into the drafting of regional action plans, which will be submitted to the national drugs strategy team – NDST – for consideration and assessment. The NDST will make recommendations to the inter-departmental group on drugs, which I chair and to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion regarding the implementation and funding of the plans. Given the experience of the local drugs task forces, this work is likely to take up most of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">As regards resources for the RDTFs in 2004, as the Deputies are aware, the subhead in my Department for drugs funds a number of different initiatives. There are no specific allocations within this subhead for particular initiatives. They will be funded as the need arises with reference to the overall allocation and competing demands on the subhead. However, as outlined above, in 2004, the funding needs of the RDTFs are unlikely to be significant due to the fact that funding will primarily be required to meet on-going administrative costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_1252">My Department's primary role with respect to supporting youth services in communities is through the young peoples facilities and services fund – YPFSF. The objective of the fund, which was established in 1998, is to attract at-risk young people into facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. To date, over €59 million has been allocated under the fund to support in the region of 350 projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">In addition, a number of other programmes administered by my Department are relevant in this regard, namely: the local development social inclusion programme which seeks to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion. Community based youth initiatives are one of the three main strands of the programme and area partnerships and community groups support a variety of projects in this regard; and the LEADER+ programme which in its funding of projects has identified two groups for priority attention which it considers represent the key to the development of rural areas – women and young people. While youth may not be a specific focus of projects funded through the community development programmes, projects undertake work with the youth in their target areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">Funding is also available under the CLÁR programme to support youth services and facilities and from my own Department and Údarás na Gaeltachta to support such services in the Gaeltacht.</p>

          <p eId="para_1258">In line with the recognition of the vital contribution that rural communities make to society and mindful of the importance of rural economies in many of the acceding member states, I propose to hold a two-day conference on rural Europe during the Irish Presidency in Westport. The conference will address wider rural development issues and themes outside, but informed by, the Common Agricultural Policy. The timing is particularly appropriate for focusing on the wider rural development issues facing the enlarged Union. It is envisaged that the conference will address issues such as access to services and infrastructure including rural transport, quality of life, rural populations, alternative employment opportunities including small food production systems, rural tourism initiatives, strengthening communities through co-operation and more effective social capital and access to education, training and lifelong learning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">The European foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions will be closely involved with the conference. The findings of a survey on living conditions and quality of life in 28 European countries, being carried out by the foundation, will underpin a significant portion of the event. The foundation will also be directly involved in running a number of parallel workshops. While participants will be invited to attend both from state and community sectors, it is intended that the main players addressing the conference and contributing to the overall discussion on future needs will be direct stakeholders in rural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">I also propose to host a high level conference at official level to address issues relating to economic and social cohesion policies for specific areas of the EU with recognised territorial handicaps, such as islands, mountainous areas and sparsely populated areas. The conference will be held in Galway in May 2004. My officials have held discussions with officials in the Commission's directorate general for regional policy about the conference programme. A further meeting is due to take place shortly to advance preparations for the conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">I should also mention that a meeting of European Union drugs co-ordinators will take place in Dublin in June 2004. The meeting will bring together senior officials from the EU member states to consider a range of strategic issues as regards tackling the problem of drug misuse and exchanging ideas and best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">The timing of these events means that they will take place after the formal enlargement of the EU on 1 May 2004. In addition to the overall objective of contributing to furthering strategic consideration by the EU in important policy areas, the conferences should provide an occasion on which to celebrate with and welcome new members to the European Union.</p>

It employs about 100 persons in general insurance business such as policy processing and claims handling. Prudential Financial Inc. has signed an agreement with Liberty Mutual and Palisades for the sale of its property and casualty insurance businesses. The deal is due to close at the end of this month. As part of the deal, it was agreed that Prumerica will continue to support the Prudential property and casualty operations centre's Irish-based activity. It will also provide transition services to the new owners, pending its re-location to the US and Prumerica's development of alternative activities here. It is not anticipated that employment in the Irish operations will be adversely affected by these developments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1269">The community employment review process, which is ongoing, is due to be concluded shortly. The Government has decided in the context of the 2004 Estimates that there will be no reduction in the number of places to be supported under the community employment programme next year. The number of places will not drop below the target level of 20,000 for the end of 2003. The total allocation for the CE, JI and social economy programmes has been fixed at €351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places across the three schemes. FÁS is being given some flexibility in the management of the financial allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market, while facilitating the support of community services. The commitment to fund a continuing pool of up to 25,000 places across the three schemes brings clarity to the levels of activity which will be supported and will enable FÁS to give a clear commitment to the support of local community services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">In deciding the 2004 financial allocation for the schemes, the Government was informed by the work to date of the cross-departmental senior officials group. Although the total financial envelope for the schemes has been fixed, the views of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market on the review of active labour market programmes, when completed, and the eventual outcome of the review of the social economy programme will be taken into account in considering adjustments in the structure and the terms and conditions of the labour market measures in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1272">Ring rot is a bacterial disease that affects potatoes. It is not airborne and does not survive in soil without a host crop, but it can survive for some time on machinery, handling equipment and stores. Ring rot is primarily introduced by the planting of infected seed potatoes. Under Council Directive 93/85/EEC, all EU member states are obliged to conduct annual surveys for ring rot. The directive lays down detailed measures which must be observed in relation to the detection, prevention, spread and eradication of the pathogen. Some 600 samples were taken under the survey across the entire potato sector last year. This involved the national crop of seed and ware and imports from the EU and third countries. The sampling regime is based on risk analysis. To date, all samples have proved negative for ring rot.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">A single interception in Wales on potatoes originating in the Netherlands does not constitute a valid or sustainable reason for a complete ban on potato trade from the UK. We will continue to monitor the situation in that country closely, however, in consultation with the authorities there. Testing for ring rot is being reviewed in the context of the risks involved. All commercial growers are being asked to identify their seed source with a view to identifying risk material. A joint review of strategies to combat the risk of infection is under way between my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_1345">A humanitarian aid scheme was implemented in 1995, following a Government decision, to bring some measure of relief to those who had suffered severe hardship as a result of serious flooding. County Galway was among many areas throughout the country that suffered flood damage at that time. The humanitarian aid scheme implemented was open to applicants from all parts of the country. The scheme was implemented on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis and provided humanitarian assistance, not compensation for losses. The scheme was administered on an impartial and confidential basis by the Irish Red Cross on behalf of the Office of Public Works. The amount of aid allocated for the 1995 scheme was €1,457,659. Of this amount, approximately €656,000 was paid out to flood victims in County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">In addition to the humanitarian aid scheme, the Government also approved a home relocation scheme which was set up as a once-off measure in 1996 to assist persons and families in south Galway and parts of County Clare whose houses had been particularly badly affected by the flooding in 1995 to relocate their home. In these extreme cases the houses had been damaged beyond the reasonable costs of repair or had suffered long-term flooding of a minimum of three weeks. The Government provided a total sum of €1,054,000 for this scheme and the fund was disbursed by the Office of Public Works. Out of this fund, approximately €927,199 was in respect of the relocation of County Galway flood victims.</p>

In numerical terms, the change has been even more notable with the provisional figure increasing from 267,527 in 1995-96 to 581,920 now, an increase of more than 117%.</summary>

This increase reflects the significant growth in employment over the period. In the same period, the higher rate of tax was reduced from 48% to 42% and the standard rate from 27% to 20%, thus reducing the tax burden greatly on all those in the tax net.</summary>

      asked the

The Government is also opposed to all acts and practices which degrade or exploit human beings.</p>

My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, Deputy Tom Kitt, has taken a keen interest in the issue of bonded labour and was particularly active at the ILO when he had responsibility for that portfolio in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2044">My Department, through Development Co-operation Ireland, works closely with the ILO to address, in a holistic way, the issues of employment and bonded labour.

          <p eId="para_2052">In November 2002, I announced a pause on all capital developments in the third level sector. I decided that it was prudent to re-evaluate and review the overall position with regard to third level capital projects and to establish priorities for future years. A review group, under the Higher Education Authority, was established and commenced its work in mid-May 2003. It was originally expected that the group would report to the Higher Education Authority not later than 31 October 2003. However, due to the complexity of the task in hand, the group is currently revisiting the timeframe for reporting to the HEA. When the group has completed its report, the authority will advise me of its views.</p>
          <p eId="para_2053">The purchase price for the building in question did not relate solely to the building but also included some 45 acres of land. Some minor refurbishment has already been carried out on the building which enables its partial use by Dundalk Institute of Technology. However, the institute's plans for the major refurbishment and development of this building, at an estimated cost of €13 million, formed part of its submission to the review group. Each third level institution has met the group and made a presentation of its institutional strategy and set the capital development proposals in a strategic context. Decisions on the refurbishment of the building in question at the institute will be contingent on the outcome of the review and the level of funding available for the sector. In the interim, the institute has rented some temporary accommodation off campus.</p>

These restrictions apply to every student who already holds a qualification at any level, irrespective of where that qualification was obtained.

Assistance is provided to assist students who have serious ongoing, sensory, physical and-or communicative disabilities. Application for assistance should be made by the student's institution or post-leaving certificate college. Students are advised to contact the access-disability officer in their institution or the principal in their post-leaving certificate college to discuss their particular disability and the equipment or services required.</p>

          <p eId="para_2084">Primary level teachers are class teachers, rather than subject specialists, and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. In order to be fully recognised to teach at primary level, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification can usually be achieved by a person graduating from one of the recognised teacher training courses, including postgraduate conversion courses or by a primary teacher whose qualifications were obtained abroad achieving the necessary level of competence in the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_2085">To be recognised as a teacher, the person to whom the Deputy refers must have his secondary qualifications assessed for recognition purposes. If the qualifications are acceptable and the person wishes to teach in a mainstream primary school in a permanent capacity, the person would need to successfully complete a recognised teaching conversion course to be appropriately qualified to teach in primary schools in this State. This is in line with the position whereby qualified second level teachers who trained in this State and have not undergone a postgraduate conversion course to qualify as a primary teacher are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in mainstream classes in primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_2086">Recognised secondary teachers may teach mainstream classes at primary level and receive the trained rate of pay under a scheme currently in place. Appointment to such a post would not entitle a secondary teacher to hold a permanent post at primary level.</p>

          <p eId="para_2092">Recognising that due to a downturn in the telecommunications sector in recent years private sector companies may have difficulty in funding the major infrastructure developments that are needed for broadband delivery to the regions, the Government set aside an indicative €200 million under the e-commerce and communications measure of the NDP 2000 to 2006 for telecommunications infrastructure developments in areas where private sector investment is lacking. This investment, which is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, is supporting a comprehensive programme of development including metropolitan area fibre networks, new national fibre trunk lines and extension of digital subscriber lines to 1.2 million telephone lines by mid-2004. Pilot projects using Wireless LAN technology are under way in a number of locations, including Ardee, to assess its suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions. The results of these trials are expected to be available by the end of 2003.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_246">A number of improvements have been made to the health centre since 1999, including the internal and external painting of the premises.

The speech and language therapy service has been relocated to a different area in the centre. Essential health and safety improvements have been made in the last year. Improvements to the electrical system have also been carried out. A health and safety audit, conducted in November 2002, noted significant improvements since the previous inspection and further recommendations from this recent audit are being actively addressed. It is planned to relocate the addiction services before the end of 2003. The authority have informed me that they will continue to ensure that the conditions in the existing heath centre are maintained to the highest standard possible for the effective delivery of services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_247">The ERHA has not submitted a proposal to my Department on a public private partnership for this project.

          <p eId="para_2134">As the Deputy is aware, I recently launched the report of the expert working group on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland. The report provides a detailed plan for the further development of radiation oncology services in this country. The Government has accepted the recommendations of this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_2135">The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first step of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. These centres will collectively have the staff and treatment infrastructure to permit a rapid increase in patient access to appropriate radiation therapy and will form the "backbone" of the future service expansion. This is the best model to provide a radiation oncology service to the highest standards. The development of radiation oncology services along the lines recommended in this report is the single most important priority of my Department in cancer services in the acute setting.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_248">In the short-term, I have announced approval for the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the Cork centre and the necessary capital investment amounting to €4 million to commission this service as rapidly as possible. I have now approved the appointment of a project team to prepare a brief for the rapid expansion of capacity from four to eight linear accelerators. I intend also to prioritise the necessary resources to ensure that the radiation oncology centre in Galway, which is being commissioned is in a position to treat patients, commencing in spring 2005. I have also requested the Western Health Board to prepare a development control plan to facilitate the expansion from three to six linear accelerators in the medium-term. I will give early approval to the establishment of a project team to plan this expansion. These developments in Cork and Galway will provide an additional five linear accelerators. This is a significant increase that will ensure when fully developed that an additional 2,000 patients are treated per year. Five additional consultant radiation oncologists will be employed in the provision of these services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_249">I will require radiation oncology centres to provide services on an equitable basis which will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. I will also require radiation oncology centres to provide outreach services to hospitals in adjoining regions. This is the case and as more consultant radiation oncologists are appointed it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services. This will improve access for patients in the south-east, mid-west and north-west</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_250">In addition, the Government has also decided that in the future development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_251">It is my intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology. The twin objectives of equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme need to be supported by a co-ordinating mechanism, as recommended in the report. I have now established a national radiation oncology co-ordinating group. The group will,inter alia, facilitate improved access to existing and planned services. The group will comprise clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2156">Regulations were made in November 2000 to provide for a revised taxi licensing regime in response to an October 2000 High Court judgment that created the legal position that limitation of taxi licences in the interests of existing licence holders could not be sustained.</p>
          <p eId="para_2157">In February 2002 the Government approved the appointment of a panel of three independent persons to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship which may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of entry to the taxi industry on 21 November 2000. No prior parameters were imposed on the recommendations the panel might make. The panel invited submissions from taxi licence holders and also met taxi representative groups and some individuals who made submissions before finalising and submitting its report to me. The report of the panel recommended the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship. The panel recommended that a range of payments might be made to eligible and qualifying taxi licence holders for sums ranging from €3,000 to €15,000 depending on the category of hardship involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_2158">I have accepted the report of the taxi hardship panel and the Government has also approved the implementation on a phased basis of its recommendations in accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government. This position remains unchanged and I have no proposals to reopen either the terms of the taxi hardship panel report or the Government's decision on it.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_255">Area Development Management Limited, ADM, has been engaged to administer and manage the implementation of the taxi hardship payments scheme in accordance with the Government decision to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report on a phased basis. There are no proposals for payments beyond the recommendations of that report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_256">Application forms have recently issued to persons who made submissions to the taxi hardship panel. In addition, newspaper advertisements were placed in the national newspapers on 6 November 2003 inviting applications under the scheme from individual taxi licence holders at 21 November 2000 who can demonstrate that they have suffered extreme personal financial hardship following loss of income arising from the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime, who fall into one of the six categories in which payment was recommended by the taxi hardship panel report, and who are tax compliant.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_257">The content of the application form and the qualifying criteria for applicants were the subject of a number of in-depth discussions between my Department and taxi representative groups, including FAIR. Issues raised by the taxi representative groups during those discussions were responded to positively, while remaining within the parameters of the taxi hardship panel report and the Government's decision on it.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_258">ADM has commenced the processing and assessing of applications as the application forms and associated required documentation are returned to them. It is expected that the first payments to qualifying persons under the process will be made before the end of the year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2169">As the Deputy may be aware, funding of €5.577 million has been allocated to Garda youth diversion projects in the current year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2170">While I have secured an overall increase of 9.5% in the Estimates for the Vote for the Garda Síochána in 2004, the continuing need to maintain discipline in the public finances means that I must prioritise expenditure and so cannot increase the funding for all items of expenditure in the Vote. As a result, the Abridged Estimates Volume for 2004 provides for funding of €5.318 million for the youth diversion projects. However, in view of the fact that most of the more recently established projects incurred start up expenses in the last two years which are not expected to be a feature in the coming years, I am confident that all of the projects can be maintained on the proposed funding allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2171">It is not envisaged that additional Garda youth diversion projects will be established in the short-term. However, the possibility of funding of further projects, in the future in the light of prevailing budgetary conditions will remain under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_2185">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 294 of 25 November 2003 on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_2186">The Deputy will be aware of my position, which is shared by the Government, that the proposal put forward by the Prison Officers' Association, POA, for negotiation is essentially a claim for an improvement in pay. As such claims are precluded under Sustaining Progress, I am not prepared to authorise the prison service to enter talks in any forum where a proposal involving such an increase would be part of the discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2187">The POA proposal completely ignores the key issue which has been at the heart of discussions to date, that is, the elimination of overtime working. The introduction of an annualised hours system of attendance, which both sides had agreed more than a year ago should be the main focus of further discussion, is also ignored in the POA proposal. Their document actually envisages leaving the prison overtime system intact or replacing it through the recruitment of up to 1,200 extra staff. Both propositions are unacceptable and totally unrealistic. The Deputy will appreciate that, in this context, the suggestion that the Irish Prison Service enter into discussions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission without preconditions is not a realistic proposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_2188">I have discussed with the POA, at a meeting on 20 November, my position regarding a resumption of negotiations. I found the meeting to be useful and I am still hopeful that progress may yet be made. However, in the absence of an agreed way forward before 1 January 2004, the Government decision of 11 November on alternative cost reduction measures will be progressively implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_2190">I would certainly like to be in a position to act as the person wishes if that would help somehow to ameliorate the hurt that person feels. I cannot, however, act as requested because the question of a pardon only arises in the case of a criminal conviction. In this instance, the proceedings in question related to the placing of a destitute child in care. I fully appreciate the hurt the person in question feels and I would accept that the law at the time was harsh in the manner it treated children deemed to be destitute.</p>
          <p eId="para_2191">I have had inquiries made in this matter and I have been informed that the person in question – who was less than two years old at the time and deemed to be destitute – was sent to an industrial school in 1935 by order of the District Court pursuant of the Children Act 1908. As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and, therefore, it is not open to me to comment or intervene in any way on how a particular case was conducted or the outcome of any such proceedings.</p>

The schemes are intended to ensure that the longstanding practice of levying development contributions to help fund local authority infrastructure is implemented in a more transparent and consistent way across the country than has been the case in the past. The final decision on making a development contribution scheme, and setting the levies, rests with the elected members of the local authority. The schemes will apply to all development, not just housing development. I am satisfied that they will not have a negative impact on rural populations.</p>

It was designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects. Over €59 million was allocated under the young people's facilities and services fund in LDTF areas and four other urban centres. The fund aims to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.

      if, when a person is being assessed for farm assist and the social welfare office is examining the telephone and electricity bills of their household, there are specific guidelines in place by her Department to determine the portion of these charges that can be categorised as farm expenses when compared with private use; and the guidelines that social welfare officers work under in these instances.

          <p eId="para_2397">In determining the means of a farmer for the purposes of the farm assist scheme account is taken of the gross yearly income that the farmer and his or her spouse or partner may reasonably expect to receive, less any expenses necessarily incurred in carrying on the business. Where expenses are shared between domestic and farm use, for example a private car used in connection with the work of the farm or the cost of electricity and telephone charges, the onus is on the applicant to provide the necessary information so that the extent of domestic-farm use may be determined.</p>
          <p eId="para_2398">Where an inspector is satisfied that verification is not possible, reasonable figures given by the applicant will be accepted. Alternatively, the inspector will make an estimate of the expenses attributable to the farm based on comparable enterprises in the locality.</p>
          <p eId="para_2399">If there have been any changes in circumstances since the last means assessment the farmer may request a means review. If a farmer disagrees with a means assessment she or he may appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office.</p>

          <p eId="para_2403">The household benefits package comprises the electricity-gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes. It is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years can qualify regardless of their income or household composition.</p>
          <p eId="para_2404">In order to be eligible for the schemes a person who is under 70 years of age must, as well as receiving a qualifying payment, be living alone or with certain excepted persons. An adult dependant or qualified adult is an excepted person for the purposes of the household benefits package. A qualified adult is an applicant's spouse or partner who is being wholly or mainly maintained by the applicant.</p>
          <p eId="para_2405">A dependent child under 18 years, or under 22 years if in full-time education, is also regarded as an excepted person. A dependant aged over 22 years is not regarded as an excepted person for the purpose of the schemes. There are no figures available on the number of applicants who have been refused household benefits for this reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_2406">Significant improvements have been made in the free schemes in recent budgets in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. The current arrangements will be kept under review in a budgetary context.</p>

          <p eId="para_2460">The person concerned applied for carer's allowance in June in respect of her two sons. Following the necessary investigations she was awarded the allowance for one of her sons at the reduced weekly personal rate of €94.60 having been assessed with weekly means of €41.09 derived from her husband's earnings. She was also awarded a dependant child allowance of €8.40 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_2461">She was refused a 50% increase in her allowance in respect of her other son on the grounds that she was not providing full-time care and attention to him as prescribed in regulations. She was notified of this decision, the reason for it and of her right to appeal within 21 days to the social welfare appeals office. There is no record of an appeal having been lodged in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_2462">On 11 November the person concerned informed my Department that she had taken up part-time employment for ten hours per week. On this basis a new means assessment was carried out and her weekly means increased to €78.79. The weekly rate of payment of carer's allowance was reduced accordingly to €57.10 per week effective from 27 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_2463">The person concerned has been notified of this decision. She was requested to return her payable order book to my Department after cashing the order dated 27 November. She was again notified of her right to appeal within 21 days to the social welfare appeals office.</p>

From that date the scheme does not apply to certain full-time postgraduate courses. Participants on the scheme who had commenced postgraduate courses of study prior to this change continue to receive funding until the completion of their courses. Following this revision only those applicants wishing to take up a higher diploma in any discipline or a graduate diploma in primary school teaching have been approved for participation in the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_2472">Last year the allowance was reviewed in the light of economic and labour market changes and, in particular, the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the allowance in 1993. The review also took cognisance of an evaluation of the scheme by independent consultants. They recommended restructuring of the scheme in the light of the transformed labour market situation and, in particular, that it should be refocused on the long-term unemployed. They also recommended that non-financial supports be enhanced and a reduction in the overall numbers on the scheme. Following the review the qualifying period for persons on unemployment benefit-assistance was increased to five years with effect from 1 January. I will continue to monitor the scheme but I have made no changes to the existing qualifying criteria in the context of the 2004 Estimates.</p>

          <p eId="para_2474">The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment. It provides income support to people who are providing elderly and incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_2475">Provision has been made in successive budgets for substantial improvements to the scheme. For example, in April the weekly income disregards increased to €210 for a single carer and to €420 for a couple. The effect of the increase is that a couple with two children, earning a joint income of up to €24,150, can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. Carer's allowance recipients who care for more than one incapacitated person are entitled to an additional 50% of their rate of payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2476">The annual respite care grant is payable to recipients of carer's allowance and carer's benefit. It was increased to €735 in 2003. People caring for more than one person receive a double respite care grant of €1,470.</p>
          <p eId="para_2477">Carer's allowance recipients also qualify for the free schemes. They are a major additional benefit and cover free travel and the household benefits package. The back to work allowance, back to education allowance and community employment schemes are available to carers when they cease caring. Any further changes to the carer's allowance is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</p>
