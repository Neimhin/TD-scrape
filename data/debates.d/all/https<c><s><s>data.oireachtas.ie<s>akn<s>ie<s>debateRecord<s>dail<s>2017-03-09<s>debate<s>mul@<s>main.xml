          <p eId="para_1"> Acting Chairman, Deputies, experience tells us it can take time to shine a light on dark periods of our history. The truth is hidden; sometimes it is hidden in plain sight. It takes the brave testimony of survivors, long studies by historians and the dogged determination of investigative journalists to bring a spotlight to events which were previously only whispered about, in this case for generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> It is now almost a week since the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes confirmed what we had all feared. Today I wish to place on the record of this House the commission’s update that a significant number of human remains are buried in the site of the old mother and baby home in Tuam. For survivors, loved ones and campaigners such as the tireless Catherine Corless it was a moment of vindication. After decades, and years of hard work, determination and unwavering commitment, the truth has been laid bare for all of us to see. This House and our entire State owe a debt of gratitude to Catherine Corless for her work. Many men and women alive today spent time in that institution, either as children or as young women. Today I offer them my personal solidarity and, as a citizen, my personal apology for the wrongs that were done to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> Deputies will know that the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes continues its work. They will also know that calls have been made for the terms of reference of this commission to be reviewed. I acknowledge the calls made since Friday for an expansion of the terms of reference to cover all institutions, agencies and individuals that were involved with Ireland’s unmarried mothers and their children. I can commit to Deputies that a scoping exercise will be carried out to examine this. I will be announcing the detail of this exercise in the coming weeks. I will also be publishing the second interim report of the commission by the end of this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> I am mindful that, by design, the commission is largely concerned with questions of legality, of legal liability, of compliance with the laws of the day and so on. These are important questions. They are, however, not the only issues which we should consider. What happened in Tuam is part of a larger picture. It is part of a tapestry of oppression, abuse and systematic human rights violations that took place all over this country for decades. As a modern, open society we must not treat these as isolated incidents but rather confront what was a dark period in an honest, mature and reflective way.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> We must acknowledge that what was happening in these institutions was not unknown and was not without the support of many pillars in society. We must acknowledge that this very House debated legislation that allowed for those residing in institutions such as county homes to work for little or nothing in return for the so-called charity that was shown to them. Lest we contend that people did not know what was happening, let us remember that some Members of this House spoke out against it. In the finance committee debates on the Health Bill 1952, which took place in July 1953, Deputy Kyne condemned putting unmarried mothers in county homes to effectively involuntary labour as “having revenge on her”. Deputy Captain Cowan described as “absolute brutality” the fact that, as he described it, “they are not let out even”. Earlier than that, before our Constitution had been finalised, Members of the Oireachtas also raised questions about the ill-treatment of so-called illegitimate children. Thus, as I said, although this history may be dark, it was not entirely unknown.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> We must acknowledge that sometimes it was fathers and mothers, brothers and uncles, who condemned their daughters, sisters, nieces and cousins and their children to these institutions - and that sometimes it was not. We must accept that between 1940 and 1965 a recorded 474 so-called “unclaimed infant remains” were transferred from mother and baby homes to medical schools in Irish universities. We must listen to, record and honour the truth of people’s experiences. We must commit to the best of our ability to recognising, recording and making reparations for the truth. Making these commitments and honouring them will not be easy, but we must do so, for those who suffered and also for future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> Establishing the truth is important for many reasons but not least to ensure that the darkness of the past will not return in the future. Irish women and Irish children must never have to endure such suffering again. As a feminist, as an Independent Minister and as an Irish woman I feel a moral and ethical compulsion to reach beyond the legal questions of what happened in Tuam and elsewhere. I feel a compulsion to try to arrive at this truth. It is only from acceptance of the truth that we can move past it, not by drawing a line under it but by highlighting it and recognising it as part of our history and part of our national story. We must commemorate and memorialise this truth and we must honour its victims. We must recognise the part that individuals, communities and institutions played. We must make sure that, while we still have time, we look to those who are still alive and accept their accounts of what was done to them, and of the wrongness of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> In the coming days I will start a conversation with advocates, historians and scholars specialising in transitional justice. The United Nations defines transitional justice as the set of approaches a society uses "to try to come to terms with a range of large scale past abuses". Transitional justice puts survivors and victims at the heart of the process. It commits to pursuing justice through truth. It aims to achieve not only individual justice, but a wider societal transition from more repressive times, in order to move from one era to another. Taking a transitional justice approach means that we will find out and record the truth, ensure accountability, make reparation, undertake institutional reform and achieve reconciliation. I want to acknowledge the many people who have contacted me personally in recent days to tell me directly of their experiences. It is important also to ensure that we learn from international best practice in transitional justice, such as the museums of memory in Argentina and Chile, for example. There may also be lessons to be learned from processes used to establish the truth in other contexts and other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Writing in the <i>London Review of Books</i> last year about the mother and baby home in Tuam and other matters, our laureate for Irish fiction, Anne Enright, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The living can be disbelieved, dismissed, but the dead do not lie. We turn in death from witness to evidence, and this evidence is indelible, because it is mute.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Let us not disbelieve. Let us not dismiss. Let us commit to do justice not solely through law but through speaking and listening, and through believing what our eyes, our ears and our compatriots tell us.</p>

          <from>Deputy Anne Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">I thank the Minister for her speech. I welcome all she has said this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Deputy Micheál Martin is attending meetings of the ALDE group in regard to Brexit. He sends his apologies. He would have contributed to the debate this morning were he present.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Last Friday morning, 3 March, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, informed colleagues and Galway County Council that exploratory excavations at the site of the Bon Secours mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway had confirmed that the remains found at the site were human remains. The remains dated from 1925 to 1961, the timeframe in which the Bon Secours home was in operation. They were found in two underground structures believed to have been built to deal with sewage.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The commission's remit includes investigating several specific areas of practice and procedures in the care, welfare, entry arrangements and exit pathways for the women and children who were residents of the 14 named institutions and representative sample of county homes identified by the commission. </p>
          <p eId="para_16"> In the 1970s, Tuam locals discovered what they believed were human remains at the site. Local historian Catherine Corless discovered death records for 796 babies and infants who did not have burial records. This indicated that the remains found on the site may have been buried by the mother and baby home. Without carbon dating and further investigation it was impossible to establish whether these remains were interred at the time of the mother and baby home's operation or at an earlier point such as the Great Irish Famine. Thanks to the work of the commission we now know that the remains were from children aged from 35 foetal weeks to two and a half years at the time of their deaths. It is not yet known how many remains are at the site although the Minister has confirmed there is a significant number. That is the phrase that reverberated around Tuam last Friday: significant number. That is when the clock struck 12. That is when silence dawned. That is when darkness came over the town of Tuam and the county of Galway. That part of history would not have been acknowledged were it not for the original works of Catherine Corless, the efforts of survivors and the work of members of my party, previous and current, who lobbied and pushed for this investigation. The commission of investigation has done a huge amount of work to get to this stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_17"> What happened in Tuam is an absolute tragedy and a disgrace. Although we have known for a long time that women and children had been treated in the most appalling manner in this country, the recent discoveries in Tuam are truly the stuff of nightmares. To know that a significant number of children and infants were buried there without rite or ritual chills me to the core. Now, as we have been too many times before, we are confronted by the sheer inhumanity that has been shown to these women, buried with not even a stone to mark their passage or their presence. These children were not accorded the symbols to represent the respect they deserve. They were born as no-ones. They were buried as no-ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is co-ordinating the commission. We must encourage the commission to expand its scope. I will be calling for that to happen. It is the very least we should do for all women who entered mother and baby homes and county homes. The life of a mother or a baby in Tuam is no different to the life of a mother or a baby anywhere else in this country. We must treat all of our mothers and babies equally. My concern, which I believe the House shares, is for the lack of respect for the fundamental dignity and humility of the mothers and children who spent time in the Bon Secours and other such institutions in this country. </p>
          <p eId="para_19"> I am conscious that there are hidden layers and complexities to the issue before us. No-one knows this better than the parties directly affected by the discovery in Tuam. First and foremost are the mothers and the babies who survived from these homes, be they adopted or fostered. Their relatives and friends have been left anguished by the thoughts of what has happened to their loved ones. What these women and children experienced as a result of being forced into mother and baby homes was cruel and inhumane. </p>
          <p eId="para_20"> As a people, we should feel great shame that this has unfolded before our eyes, eyes that watch carefully for a person upon whom to cast judgment, to blame and to castigate. Those same eyes turned away from the immense suffering and tragedy that was visited upon these women and their children. This wilful hypocrisy and contradiction are among the most troubling aspects of this case. To experience the cruelty that these women and children experienced is a deep wound. To come out to be met with widespread denial and stonewalling is yet another. We cannot have justice for survivors until we know what they have survived.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> Last Friday I rang Tommy Warde, from Kylebrack, Loughrea, County Galway. He was on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday. Last night, he described himself as one of the lucky ones. He was fostered. There has been little discussion about the children fostered from the mother and baby homes. Tommy was five and a half years of age when he was put in a van and brought to his new foster parents. Today he reflects on the sadness of what has emerged because he sees those babies as his brothers and sisters. They were his family. That was the institution Tommy lived in until he was five and a half years old. He never saw a cow or a sheep until he moved to Woodford. He knew no form of love or appreciation until he went to Woodford.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> When we reflect back on society and Government and on who had a role, we should realise that we all had a role. Tommy was fostered and an allowance was paid for him. Who paid the allowance? Tommy's foster home had inspections, of which they knew in advance. However, who carried out the inspections? Where are the records? There are records. We have an allowance and records of inspections. When Tommy hit 18 years of age, he was given the price of a bicycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Who gave him that? The bicycle was to allow him to take up an apprenticeship. Fortunately for him, he said he did not like carpentry and he was looked favourably upon and allowed to become a mechanic. Tommy is one of the lucky ones. He has advocated for years for the issue to be dealt with. He thanks the Minister and commission for highlighting the issue - for the first time in his life his voice has been heard and for that he is grateful.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> We have to write our history. We must also think about children on waiting lists, in homeless accommodation or with disabilities who do not get the appropriate services they need. In 100 years' time I do not want it to be said that I failed. That is why it is important that we dovetail history. While we think of the past, we must also think of the present because I do not want to be part of the future history that stood by and talked about children with disabilities or those on waiting lists because we will be remembered in the same way. They are the people who need a voice and that is what is expected of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> We on this side of the House will support the Minister. We need to expand the scope of the work and for all of the people who have had horrific lives to come forward. We need to examine the scope of the commission's work. Let us make it inclusive and ensure that when women come forward they do not sit at a table across from six people who are investigating them. Let us make sure that the women concerned have support going into a room because they are vulnerable and we have to encourage them to come forward and engage with the commission. Without their engagement, we will leave a big, black, dark hole in Irish history. We need everybody to engage with the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> To date, the residents of Tuam have not engaged with the commission. I encourage them to come forward. I represent the people of Tuam and my heart goes out to them. However, we also have to think about the building works currently taking place at the grove site in Tuam.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">Yesterday was International Women’s Day, a day which celebrates women and their role in society and when we advocate for the empowerment and the equality of women. It is a day when we recognise our respect for women and demands for equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> On Sunday fortnight, we also have another day that celebrates women, namely mother’s day. Children show thanks for the tender loving care they have received over their lifetime. The bond between a mother and her children is like no other, and one that should always be cherished. Unfortunately, we have learned all too tragically that for some that bond was ripped apart at the seams. The tragic circumstances surrounding Tuam have touched everyone’s hearts, and for those survivors of Tuam and homes like it it must be a difficult day dogged by horrible memories and a longing for closure. They are longing for a bond and relationship that most of us are lucky enough to take for granted. For many mothers, there is uncertainty as to what happened to their children. An tseachtain seo caite, nuair a fuaireas amach an scéal seo ón dTuaim, bhraitheas tinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> To most who have been following this story for some time, the confirmation came as no great surprise. Yet, the news did not lose its impact, potency or ability to shock and appal. In death, as in life, these people were left to be forgotten and were hidden away from sight of the Irish people as though they were a source of shame. Ach a mhalairt atá ann mar is ar an Stát agus ar an tír seo atá an náire don am sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> In so many ways, the State has not yet faced up to what has happened. I acknowledge what the Minister said today. However, the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, continuously spoke about the families who rejected these women and their children. I agree that society has to carry its share of the blame, but the State should not be written out. It funded, referred people to and facilitated these places. The State knew what was happening and was complicit, and it will continue to be complicit if it cannot provide the truth to survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> On the 15 February last in Geneva, at a hearing of the United Nations, a representative from the Department of Justice and Equality stated that while the Taoiseach made an apology to the survivors of the Magdalen laundries, he did so despite the fact that in the McAleese report there was no finding of liability. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has stated the same on the Dáil record. This entirely disregards that about a quarter of referrals made to these homes was by the State. The State is still not facing up to its responsibility for these events. Despite the attempts to wash our hands, the stains will remain unless we deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> As has been stated, there are many concerns about other homes. What happened to the children in those homes? The story told by death records given to the HSE in 2011 and reported by Conall Ó Fátharta of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, do not ease anyone's fears. The register of deaths given to the HSE for Bessborough, in my constituency in Cork, reflects that 273 deaths were recorded between 1939 and 1944. However, the order reported 353 deaths to State inspectors during this period, which is a significant disparity and raises some very worrying questions. Did deaths happen which were unreported to the authorities or were false records created? If neither frightening possibility is the case, then what happened? </p>
          <p eId="para_35"> In Sean Ross Abbey, the death register lists a total of 269 deaths between 1934 and 1967, but some of those buried in the plot there are not listed on the register. It is also deeply shocking and appalling to learn that the main cause of death in the case of some 20% of the deaths in Bessborough was marasmus or severe malnutrition - in other words, death by hunger was happening in the 1940s and 1950s in Cork. At a minimum, we need to expand drastically the terms of reference of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> While the Minister was not in government at the time, her colleagues signed off on the terms of reference despite the fact that people across the Chamber and outside were telling the Government that the terms of reference did not take account of enough matters and that the process and the number of homes included was not adequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> The commission is simply not fit for purpose. I welcome the words of the Minister when she said she will consider various processes. That is vitally important, because the current process is not adequate to examine the plethora of issues it is to investigate and various related matters coming down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> There are other issues connected to the commission. Women will pour out their hearts and go through traumatic hearings, yet will come out without a counsellor to meet them. Things like that need to be rectified.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> I very much welcome the statement of the Minister that she will publish the report. It has already been far too long; some six months have elapsed. Many were becoming concerned about the cause of the delay and the response of State authorities while the report was sitting on the desk of the Minister. I welcome that commitment and look forward to reading the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> Several years ago, a commitment was made to build a memorial at Sean McDermott Street laundry to honour the victims of the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes. There has been no progress on that since. The least we can do is to memorialise these women and their children and give them the dignity in death that they did not have in life.</p>

          <p eId="para_42"> I wish the Minister well in her endeavours.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">Last Friday, the commission of investigation confirmed the worst fears of many of us here when it announced that a significant quantity of human remains had been discovered at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam. The remains are those of almost 800 children and babies who were buried in a septic tank with no explanation so far for the cause of their deaths. Mar a dúirt an Piarsach:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_44">Mise Éire:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_45">Sine mé ná an Chailleach Bhéarra ...</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_46">Mór mo náir.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">Women were denied their rights and they were treated as slaves. Some babies were treated as guinea pigs in medical experiments and many were forcibly and illegally adopted. These citizens were treated like this because they were born or they gave birth outside of wedlock. It was a conservative, mean-spirited, narrow-minded political elite in this State in alliance with the church hierarchies that allowed these anti-women practices to penetrate every facet of Irish life. The system under which this abuse happened was supported, approved and inspected by the State. It happened with the clear sanction and connivance of many who sat in this Chamber. Many of the practices which now give rise to our moral outrage were legislated for in this Chamber. I appeal again for a formal State apology to the victims and survivors of mother and baby homes and other institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> The terms of reference relating to the work of investigating all this have to deal with all the issues involved. When Sinn Féin moved a Private Members' motion in June 2014 seeking an investigation into claims about babies buried in Tuam, especially those resulting from the work of Catherine Corless, we said, as did others, that the Government's response was inadequate, and this is now evident. The UN, among others, has said the current investigation does not meet international standards. Tuam was part of a vast network which systematically violated the rights of women and their children and there were upwards of 180 institutions of this kind throughout the State and more in the North. It is imperative that the terms of reference be extended to include all institutions and that the victims and survivors are at the heart of whatever processes we establish. The people of this island owe a huge debt of gratitude to the campaigners, archivists, historians and some journalists who did so much to unearth the horrors, but I especially, most of all, would like to commend the survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I do not have the time to elaborate on this but we continue to fail women and children in this State. We continue to fail to protect women with crisis pregnancies while the Government continues to cut funding for rape crisis and family refuge centres. Some day, we may well have another inquiry into the treatment of people, including children, in direct provision centres, into the failure to provide proper resources or into protection of children with disabilities or mental health issues or into those who are homeless or on hospital waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> I welcome the Minister's commitment to publish the second interim report of the commission, which examines all the issues, but I would also like an explanation as to why it has not been published thus far. Why is there is no Garda investigation? What is happening?</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Many of the scandals that have surfaced in recent times have two things in common. They mostly involve disadvantaged or poor people and the Government and the establishment always had to be pulled kicking and screaming to deal reluctantly with the issues involved.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_52">I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated she will publish the report. I agree with Deputy Adams that we need an explanation as to why that has taken so long. There does not seem to be any reason it should have taken this time but I welcome the fact that it will be published. I also welcome the Minister's commitment to carrying out a scoping exercise to examine extending the terms of reference of the commission of inquiry. However, much more than a scoping exercise is needed and I sincerely hope at the end of it that she will announce an extension of the terms of reference because the commission of inquiry will only examine a sample of 14 mother and baby homes and four county homes. For example, none in the county I live in will be examined. Eighteen homes is clearly not enough and many people are excluded who were either born in a mother and baby home or a county home or were placed in one of them or had relatives who were placed in them. They have been following the horrific news in respect of Tuam over the past week or two. They cannot be left out of the exercise that will be carried out and, therefore, it must be ensured that a comprehensive investigation is carried out because this is a scandal of huge proportions.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Many of us knew about this because Catherine Corless had many times outlined the horrible work she had to do in Tuam but this was absolutely clarified when we received the information that human remains had been found on the site in awful burial chambers underground. They were meant to be septic tanks and sewerage facilities but they contained the bodies of we do not know how many babies. The death certificates indicate almost 800 babies were buried there. Catherine Corless is an extraordinary woman. My understanding is that she had to fight hard to get this information and she paid €4 for every one of those death certificates. She has done an enormous service for this country and, I hope, for a more enlightened country than the picture that has been painted of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> Bessborough is another example of a home where the percentage of children aged under four who died was way higher than the average for that age cohort in the State at the time. Deputy Ó Laoghaire said that malnutrition was one of the main causes of death in the Bessborough home. The question must be asked as to why children died in these homes. One of the answers is they died because they were undernourished and were not fed properly, yet their mothers were still put in these homes by the State, their families, and other institutions that were in a position of power and authority in our society. It is an absolute stain on all of us who were aware over time that these terrible things were happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> Issues such as vaccine trials, illegal adoptions and babies being sent to America without anybody knowing they were being sent will rightly be covered by the commission because all the facts must be unearthed. We also have the Grace case, about which all of us had an opportunity to speak in recent days. I came into the House in 1998 around the time the then Taoiseach made an apology on behalf of the Irish people in respect of the children who were abused in residential institutions. The commission to inquire into child abuse was established and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 which set up the Residential Institutions Redress Board was also passed. I recall hearing about golden circles in our society where rich and powerful people, whether they were developers, bankers, politicians and so on had extraordinary power and influence. At the same time, there was what others and I described as a "grey circle". This referred to the grey walls around many institutions where those who were not considered to be important were placed. We knew many of them had been put into residential institutions that were mainly run by religious orders but the State was involved as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">We have known for some time also that the mother and baby homes were likely to be equally shameful in terms of what was going on at that time. We did not have as much information at the time about mother and baby homes as we have now, and as we will have in the immediate future but we must get to a point where we uncover all of the uncomfortable and shameful truths because until we do, we will not have the foundations to build the kind of caring, inclusive and equal society we all want to achieve. It is really important in all of this that we get to the truth. It is also important that we do not leave any stone unturned and that we are unafraid to open things up, whether it is under the ground or in registers of births and deaths or wherever else. There is an onus on all of us to ensure that happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> I welcome the fact the Minister has made an apology but I note it was a personal apology. I presume there is an apology on behalf of the State. I agree with those who have said there is a need for memorials and a conversation. I acknowledge that in her contribution the Minister said she intends to engage with people who are directly affected. Memorials in themselves are important but it is far more important to establish the truth about the lives of the people who are affected. It we could achieve that it would be a much more meaningful memorial.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> I welcome the progress that is being made and more progress remains to be made. Unfortunately, there is much more shameful information about the past of this country, and some of it in the present as well and as representatives of the people in this Chamber we all have an obligation to ensure that we find out the full truth and that we face the consequences in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">In 2011 the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus discontinued its adoption service and gave the registers from its mother and baby home at Bessborough in Cork to the HSE. In 2012 senior HSE personnel who were concerned at what was contained therein sent a report to the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on the number of deaths that had occurred at Bessborough. The registers showed that in the years between 1934 and 1953 the deaths had occurred at Bessborough of 470 infants and ten women.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> According to a former chief medical officer of the State, James Deeny, in his autobiography, <i>To Cure and to Care</i>, in one year alone, of the 180 children born in the home 100 died. One in five of those who died in the 1934 to 1953 period died of marasmus, that is, severe malnutrition. June Goulding, a midwife at Bessborough in the early 1950s, is another witness. In her book, <i>The Light in the Window</i>, she told of a house of pain where mothers in childbirth were denied pain relief and women who suffered vaginal tearing in childbirth were refused stitching as punishment for their sins. She and others told of the Americans who arrived at the home to purchase healthy babies from the nuns.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> Some years ago I was contacted by a survivor who was born at Bessborough and I visited him in his home. He expressed to me his strong opinion that not all of the babies were buried in the tiny angels burial plot at the home. He believed the decision not to give babies who were buried a gravestone or a white cross was a business one. Simply put, the Americans rolling up the driveway at the end of their journey from Shannon Airport would be less likely to buy their baby from the nuns if they were to look out of the car window and see a small forest of white crosses on the grounds of the home. He asked me to call for an excavation at the home. I have previously done so and I am doing so again today.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> We heard from Carmel Cantwell, whose brother William died in the home in the early 1960s. She does not know for sure where her brother is buried - perhaps in the angels plot but perhaps not. How many more babies such as William are buried there and where are their graves? Where can their relatives go to pay their respects? It is not good enough just to point to a tiny plot and say "He is in there, somewhere". Do William's sister and his elderly mother not deserve better than that?</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, said the other day that before we go ahead with such decisions it is important to establish whether we have any evidence which might prompt such excavations. What more evidence does the Minister need? There should be excavations at Bessborough and all of the other sites too.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> Religious institutions no longer run mother and baby homes in this country. However, the mother and baby homes were the product of a society which refused to separate the church from the State. To this day, church and State remain unseparated and religious orders still have control of schools and hospitals. The Roman Catholic Church still finds its teachings reflected in the laws of the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> The ghosts of the women who were refused pain relief in the mother and baby homes in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s watch over their granddaughters and great-granddaughters who are sent to England in secrecy and shame for the abortions the State refuses to carry out here. Ending scandals of this kind is entirely linked with ending the scandal of a conjoined church and State sanctioned through the decades by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael alike. We should separate the church from the State now.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">In recent days many people have been talking about nothing else other than the details of Tuam but we also all have a collective memory of having grown up and attended Catholic schools and lived in a Catholic-ridden State. I was talking to a friend who recalled how the nuns in her school used regularly to beat everybody but especially the Traveller girls, who were pulled down corridors by the hair. She never forgot the face on those Traveller girls as they were beaten and dragged through the school. The woman who recalled those incidents is younger than me and she has a vivid memory of what happened. If we search our memories we will all find evidence of the same kind of incidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> Without being too dramatic I wish to refer to one extract from a journalist called Donal O’Keeffe. It is really incredible. It says everything about the church and in particular the Bon Secours order. He related that a healthy little boy called John Desmond Dolan was born in 1946 in the Tuam home. He died on Wednesday, 11 June 1947, when he was a year and three months old. He was described on his death certificate in the cruel language of the day as "a congenital idiot". In an inspection in April 1947 it was reported that he was "a miserable, emaciated child with voracious appetite and no control over bodily functions, probably mentally defective". That says it all about what we are dealing with here, namely, the legacy of the church and its handling of what at the time were described as unmarried mothers but what we consider a family today. A mother and her children, without a partner, are considered a family. That said, we do not treat them as equals because the statistics are startling and show that lone parents are more likely to live in poverty and suffer from homelessness than families with both a mother and father. There is a legacy still to be dealt with in terms of how we view women who try to rear their children on their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> No matter how much we recoil over the historical facts, we must remind ourselves that we will be judged not by what we say but what we do.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">I nearly fell out of my chair yesterday morning when I heard Deputy Micheál Martin calling for two hospitals, the Mater and St. Vincent's, to be taken back into the control of the State because he has had a Damascene conversion and now believes church and State should be separated. I want to remind the world that it was Archbishop John Charles McQuaid and Éamon de Valera who established the Constitution that gave the Catholic Church the right to do what it did. It also gave the moral authority to everybody to see only the married family as central and sacrosanct and enshrined it in our Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> We have to start making a change. That is why I will repeat my call that the Bon Secours order should disband and reconsider its position, just like Fianna Fáil should reconsider its position. There are historical legacies dealt with here. Until the church and the political parties complicit in all of this put their hands up and say it was their fault, they played a huge role in it and begin to take measures to deal with that, then we are only codding ourselves. I am not here to talk the talk, I want to walk the walk. I am calling on people to walk with me tomorrow and then stand outside the Bon Secours hospitals, silent and dignified, remembering these mothers and children. The demand will be that it should reconsider its position in this country and disband its organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> Interestingly, in the same interview yesterday, Deputy Micheál Martin did not mention the Bon Secours order because private enterprise makes lots of money and the latter is the biggest private medical care provider in this country. The god is profit, money and private enterprise. Accordingly, one does not criticises them, talk about them or challenge them. I want to challenge them, as do thousands of people in this country who are sickened by this memory and the fact that today we are not dealing with that legacy, either politically or morally.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> When we look at our history and talk about change, yesterday, the streets were full of tens of thousands of young women and young men. They are demanding a different kind of Ireland. If we do not listen to them, we will be brushed aside by history itself and by the next generation. Thanks be to God for those young people because their determination is to utterly change this society. The next generation is demanding that the church get out of our schools, as Deputy Barry said, out of our hospitals, out of our beds and out of our lives. We are elected and we should begin that process to work with the young people to change the world.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">We meet so many people, individuals and groups in our political lives, and there will always be some who will make a significant impact on us. For me, some of those people are the women I met from the Magdalen laundries and from the Association of Mixed Race Irish. I met the latter group several times over the years and with them I met the then Minister, Senator James Reilly. For me, it was the additional burdens, heartbreak and pain for those in these institutions who were of mixed race. I know Rosemary Adaser has been speaking in the media about her experiences, which are very similar to the others from the group whom I met. The commission of investigation is specifically examining if any group was systematically treated differently on any grounds, including race. The association is satisfied that this has been included. However, this has to be included in the terms of reference drawn up for any investigation involving children or institutions. There is also a need for suitably qualified people to assist in investigations into race. The Association of Mixed Race Irish has wanted to see the interim report to examine if its members' issues are being adequately addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> Their admission files to mother and baby homes listed their colour under the section "Defects". Regrettably, the Ryan report did not deal directly with race. The group also wants to know the numbers of mixed-race infants who passed through all of the mother and baby homes, particularly St. Patrick's mother and baby home on the Navan Road. All these questions have to be answered and all these issues addressed. This means the terms of reference have to be wide and flexible enough, particularly with sensitive handling from trained professionals. I know some people will want to speak in public, but others will want to do so in private. Both have to be respected. Following requests from survivors who objected to the word "home" being used as they find it offensive, we had a discussion with the Minister. I know from that exchange that she was aware of the emotional impact of using that word to describe an institution of horror.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> Under the Equality Act, any investigation with children in institutions has to include race. If there is a need for a criminal investigation, then it should happen. Will the terms of reference do? What is necessary to get to the truth to get justice for everybody involved? At times when we feel that is the worst we can hear, something else emerges much worse. One of members of the Association of Mixed Race Irish has stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_77">The Dublin health authority’s mother and baby home made many references to my colour in reports for no obvious reason other than to note or highlight racial bias. For example, two psychiatrists’ reports in 1967 referred to me as "dark-skinned" in the first one and "coloured" in the second. The question is: what relevance did this have in a medical report? The admissions ledger at the industrial school had "coloured" in one of the columns and also in the heading "admissions reform". [That did not apply to children, say, with red hair or white skin.]</p>
          <p eId="para_78">The last point the person made was "I don't know how I survived this place" and then "After spending four years at St. Patrick's home, I was sent to an industrial school." The members of the association are remarkable people in the context of what they have come through and the way in which they have survived. We owe an awful lot to them to get to the truth.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">Why has the interim report not been published? If we are going to learn anything, it is to show respect. The Minister spoke about respect and dignity and I appreciate her bona fides. However, she published a report about the Tuam home last Friday without talking to any of the survivor organisations. No explanation has been given as to why this interim report, which the Minister has had since last September, has not been published. If we are going to create confidence, that will be the first step.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> The second step is that I want an assurance that the site in Tuam will be properly and forensically sealed off, as well as the full details given on this. I want an assurance that the date for applications will now be extended because quite clearly more survivors, workers and concerned people will come forward in view of the discoveries so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> We must look at expanding the terms of reference. That can only be done, however, when we see the contents of the interim report. That is why it is essential we see what has been learned so far, rather than having us ask questions as to what is being hidden. That is not my style but when an interim report is not published, then it begs the question as to why.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> Without a doubt, Tuam cannot be seen in isolation but as part of an overall system. When we have a Taoiseach talking about no nuns breaking into our homes in the middle of night, the Minister might agree that this is missing the point. These mother and baby homes were set up in total collusion with the State and successive Governments. Reluctantly, I will take this opportunity to quote a man. It is a good quote. Oliver St. John Gogarty summed up the situation well in 1928 when he declared to the Seanad, "It is high time the people of this country find some other way of loving God other than by hating women."</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> On many levels, we have continued in that vein, namely, of loving a God by demonising other people, in this case women. We have a history of doing that. The question of morality, fallen women and all of this terrible terminology was used to hide the pervasive poverty and class distinction. We have to be honest. Poor women were taken away. While the nuns themselves did not come in the middle of the night - it is not my job to demonise nuns - the State was utterly complicit in what the nuns did. If they did not come in the middle of the night, the system made it that these women did go. Separately from that, what has been ignored utterly is how many women were subject to rape and assault and ended up in these homes, adding insult to injury.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> I accept the Minister’s bona fides but let us see it in action. Let us take on the practical suggestions I have given her and have the interim report published immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">It is hard to overstate the devastation felt by citizens the length and breadth of this country as a result of the findings at Tuam. Their horror and shock are very real. It is completely hypocritical, however, for the State to feign shock at that discovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">The knowledge has been well known - our dirty hidden secret that many people, and certainly officialdom, knew about. We know that Catriona Crowe at the National Archives found records in 1996 showing illegal birth certificates and illegal passports for illegally adopted children. We know of the internal report revealed by former senior official at the HSE, Philip Garland, regarding the reports that were there about the epidemic levels of deaths in Bessborough, reports in the hands of the Department in respect of which there was no action or no inquiries for years. It is true to say these are real horrors but they are systematic of a society and a culture which demonised women and a deliberate policy of shame and stigma around fallen women. These were detention centres for pregnant women and it is apt that we are discussing these matters the day after International Women's Day and in the context of other discussions that are taking place around this issue now.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> Without making light of it, I thought the headline, "Taoiseach's Speech On Tuam To Be Followed By Decade Of Delaying Investigations", that appeared on the <i>Waterford Whispers News </i>website yesterday best captured the situation in which we find ourselves. However, that is not what we want. Since June 2011 when I asked the then Minister, Senator James Reilly, about the 42 mother and baby homes, the illegal adoptions and so on, this issue has been kicked around form Department to Department. I have had interaction with six Ministers, delays, excuses and inaction. I am not targeting this Minister or anything like that. That has been the systemic approach to these issues. I would point to the heroic work of the likes of Paul Redmond, Claire McGettrick and Conall Ó Fátharta of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, who since 2010 has been forensic in his examination of what was actually known in the State system about this horror. We have had repeated questions and passing of the buck on many of these matters. </p>
          <p eId="para_88"> What needs to be done now is what the survivor groups have asked us to do, namely, acknowledge the State's role and hold those responsible to account. The Government needs to stop running from fear of compensation. There is no way to compensate people for what has been done but let us get the truth out there. They at least deserve that. The handing over of the records held in the homes and a full audit to identify all the children is utterly necessary but critically, we cannot go to the next stage unless we see the interim report. I could plaster my walls with the amount of requests I have made for it. This must be the starting block of the expansion of the terms of reference and all those people, some living, some dead, whose history and identity were stolen and whose lives were ruined by this State. We need all survivors included. There cannot be a hierarchy, none are more important than others.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">I will speak first, if that is in order. There are only two of us sharing this time slot, myself and Deputy Mattie McGrath. We will each take five minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> I thank the Minister for bringing this subject to the floor of the Dáil. There is so much that can be said about this issue and we must all hang our heads in shame. As Deputy Clare Daly said, these facts have been known for years but it again required a whistleblower, a woman who investigated tirelessly, to bring this matter to public attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> We are deemed to be the land of saints and scholars. That is what I was taught in school but it appears from many revelations in recent years that it was only the land of saints and scholars for the privileged and for those who were compliant with the Catholic Church. If one deviated in any way, one was condemned. At the age of seven I learned right from wrong in school. Everybody in Ireland learned right from wrong or at least they should have. It is a natural instinct. We should know what is correct and what is not correct. What we are dealing with here are moral, legal and ethical issues. Moral judgments were made on these women and children by the church but also by their families in society, who placed, encouraged or forced these women into these institutions. The State also judged them on moral grounds. These were fallen women who had sinned and were to be hidden away and their children were stained with the label of illegitimacy and they were judged to be less than human. Women perhaps were abused for a second time as a result of their pregnancy by being put into these institutions and perhaps repeatedly ended up being pregnant and being put into these institutions again. They disappeared from their home, village and townland only to return a year or two later with gossip and rumour surrounding them. Many had to emigrate to England and some died as a result of their pregnancy. They died of shame because they were pregnant and we must remember those as well. Yet the fathers of these children escaped without stain or without public scrutiny and we must also bear the shame of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> Children were neglected to the extent that they died but not only did they die, they were discarded without ceremony or without dignity. That is a very difficult thing to understand, that a Catholic institution would discard a baby, his or her human remains, without any ceremony, dignity or recognition that he or she had lived in this world.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> The Catholic Church stands in the glare of exposure and investigation yet again. It only takes good men to do nothing for evil to thrive and that is exactly what happened here. The State has also very serious questions to answer in this regard in that it sponsored these institutions. When we look back at the Kerry babies controversy, this is the Kerry babies multiplied by hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds. The medical profession must also have questions to answer in this regard. How could so many children have died in these institutions? How could questions not have been asked about how these young children died? Again, it was swept under the carpet without those children having any dignity or recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> Ireland has failed these women and children. This only happened one generation ago. It is not as if it happened 100 or 50 years ago. It was happening up until the 1990s. It is absolutely unbelievable. It is disgrace and a dreadful indictment of Irish society. </p>
          <p eId="para_96"> We have commemorated the Famine for the past 160 odd years. We have viewed it as the darkest blot in our history. We have examined the Famine and blamed it on others but this situation is equivalent to the Famine and we have nobody to blame but ourselves. We are responsible for what happened. We are responsible in that we allowed the Catholic Church to allow this happen and we allowed the State to sponsor it. It is a disgrace and I hope the inquiry will get to the truth of this matter. I do not believe we can expect people to be brought to justice but we need to expose our institutions and ensure that this never happens again.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">This week, all of us have been deeply disturbed by the events in Tuam. Our hearts have been touched by the thought that so many children could have ended their lives in an environment that may have neglected or abandoned them when they were most in need of help. There is no defending or excusing away what is absolutely indefensible. It is a source of shame that so many of our nation’s children died in this way, and, indeed, continue to die through various forms of abuse. The State is complicit in the deaths and maltreatment of these children and their families but this is not yesterday’s problem. It is not a problem we have left behind. We continue to practice, with horrifying regularity, the betrayal of children and their families. After all, it was not 85 years ago, it was not 55 years ago, it was not even 25 years ago, that a report was produced that reviewed the deaths of almost 200 children who died either in the care of the State or who were known to the State’s care services. It was five years ago. Let us think about the number involved. Almost 200 children in the care of the modern Irish State died while in that State’s so-called care from 2002 to 2012, a mere ten years. That is shocking. Almost 200 children died in ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> Tuam horrifies us. It causes us all dismay and bewilderment as to how such practices could be carried out. Where was the accountability? It was not there. Where is the accountability now for that matter? Has anyone in the HSE or Tusla been held responsible for the neglect that led to the death of 200 children - unnatural deaths - from 2002 to 2012? This happened in the current period. </p>
          <p eId="para_99">My colleague has just said he does not expect anyone to be prosecuted for Tuam at this stage, but this is going on now. I welcomed the Minister, wished her well on her appointment and complimented her two weeks ago in this Chamber when she came to bring truth to the untruthfulness that had been going on. I said it was refreshing. I wish her well in her portfolio - it is not an easy one - but we need the truth and we need action.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> Tuam reminds us of the dreadful and pain-filled reality that characterised the lives of so many families. We stand condemned for our neglect and our resistance to hold those in power to account. We have sided with the powerful over the powerless; we still side with the powerful over the powerless. Tuam must lead us finally to break this cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> I thank the Minister for instructing her officials to reply to the parliamentary question I tabled that was being prevaricated over. I asked her about the number of reports of abuse of children across the categories of abuse received in each of the past three years. I also raised this question yesterday with the Taoiseach. The Minister's reply is quite staggering. The figures show that a total of 19,407 cases of physical, sexual and emotional abuse as well as abuse related to neglect were received in 2013, a few years ago. For 2014, the number of abuse cases reported across all these categories was 18,676. For 2015, the year we were preparing in a gung-ho way to commemorate 1916, the number was 18,235. However, the total number of referrals to Tusla for 2015, inclusive of the 2015 abuse figures, is a staggering 43,596. That answers it all. We can wring our hands, speak about this and be aghast and horrified, but it is still going on under our noses and under our eyes. While we only have figures per category available for 2013-14, they still show an increase of almost 1,000 reports of children being emotionally abused over that time. It is clear from this reply that we as a society still have profound challenges to face in genuinely safeguarding the interests of children who suffer the most appalling abuse. This abuse does not all occur in State homes; much of it occurs in family homes. The figures highlight a very stark reality: that we cannot parcel off the widespread abuse of children as a legacy issue from a dark and disturbing past. It still lurks with us, it is on our shoulders, it is around us and it is here.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> Tens of thousands of these cases continue to happen right under our noses and under the responsibility of a State agency, namely, Tusla, that is lurching from one crisis to another. I must ask the Minister to do something about Tusla because I receive complaints about it weekly. There is no accountability in Tusla, and how could there be? Some 4,000 staff were hived off, pushed off or whatever from the HSE with a budget and there is no accountability where they came from. They were trained and conditioned in a culture of a lack of accountability and now they are carrying on the same in Tusla.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> Yesterday evening in this House with my secretary I met a lady from Tipperary who now lives in Kildare. I was weak after standing with her and her brother's file showing the abuse he suffered as well as the non-engagement, lack of transparency, lack of investigation and prevarication on the part of An Garda Síochána and the HSE. Her brother is disabled and in a home - one in my county, unfortunately. Now the State is doing its best to make him a ward of court, get him away from everyone and bury his case further. There are many cans of worms to be opened. This is not 40, 50, 60 or 80 years ago; it is current, it is live and it is here with us. A huge responsibility rests on the shoulders of the Minister and her Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> I have just come from a meeting of the Business Committee, the members of which were very confused as to where we stand as regards the case of Grace. Quite honestly - I am not blaming the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, whom I thank for withdrawing the terms of reference yesterday - a mess has been made of this by senior officials in the Departments. Either they do not know what they are doing or they are engaged in subterfuge. I do not know how the Business Committee meeting ended because I had to leave to come here, but we cannot continue like this. There are officials who are covering up matters, hiding or ducking and diving, and it is just not acceptable. This is going on right across the HSE and Tusla, and they should be dragged out kicking and screaming. We are accountable to the people, and rightly so, but they are accountable to nobody. Deputy Harty has referred to this. There is no accountability and we must do something to get it, or else the HSE must be disbanded and the rotten sickness - I will not use the word I would like to use - treated so that we can have an accountable service that will provide some solace for parents and families who still have loved ones in institutions. Then there is the culture of HSE officials setting up companies before retiring in order to go into private care and sell care to these people, and abuse is carrying on there again. It stinks to high heaven. Legislation must be brought in to the effect that they cannot plan their retirements in this way, setting up private businesses and getting lucrative contracts. Money is their interest, not the care of children. I, together with former Senator Mary Ann O'Brien and others here, have raised such cases and got no accountability. I ask the Minister, in the name of our children and of future generations, please to continue with her refreshing stance and try to root this out.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">When I first raised this issue in the House in 2014, following my reading of newspaper reports based on the research done by Catherine Corless at the time, I called for the site at Tuam to be immediately declared a crime scene. I called for the site to be sealed and for forensic anthropologists and anything else needed to be made available in order to uncover this atrocity, and make no mistake it was and is an atrocity, a mass grave of 796 tiny bodies discarded like trash.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> I listened to the Taoiseach's speech on Tuesday about the culpability of the State and society, but the State is not some anonymous set of officials. The vast majority of the time since the foundation of the State it was led or governed by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. They were the ones who presided over debates on this matter in this Chamber and they were the ones who handed over and outsourced the responsibility for these women and children to a church they knew to be merciless at best. Therefore, when we talk about the culpability of the State and society, it is not some Joe or Josephine Soap we are talking about who condemned these women to a life of shame and condemned children to premature deaths or export. This happened mainly under the watch of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, which led the State for most of those years, and the abdication of responsibility was obvious. The attitudes which prevailed were perpetuated by every arm of the State - the Garda, the medical profession and the political system - thus allowing the church to run free with its campaign of terror and castigation of women for some perceived sin. How utterly and tragically ironic that those same nuns who labelled these women as immoral saw nothing immoral about neglecting a child to the point of early death then disposing of their bodies in a septic tank, or exporting them to another country. These are not the dark ages we are talking about. The legacies of these acts are current for some generations, and they are at best one generation removed. The relatives of these women and children are still alive. In 1995, when children playing on the site discovered skulls, it was not the police that was called for; it was a priest. He was called to bless the site. It seems that everybody went about their business as usual afterwards. The State once again turned a blind eye.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> The horrors of the mother and baby homes cannot be properly put into words. The rumours of clinical drug trials have not been properly addressed, including in the terms of reference of the last commission of investigation. The former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, called for the terms of reference to include vaccine trials. I have been talking to somebody from Tuam who, as a child, played around the site. This person uncovered on an ongoing basis discarded vials, which would suggest that there is at least something that should be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> Here we are, collectively wringing our hands, two years after it was first suggested publicly that there may be a mass grave in Tuam. The fact remains that the horrors of Tuam and other mother and baby homes existed because the State permitted the church to control some of our most fundamental institutions. The sad fact is that not everything has changed in this regard even today. We must take the church out of our schools, hospitals, medical care and politics. It is unacceptable that children are regularly discriminated against in our education system based on religion; it is unacceptable that religious orders can hold any influence over medical institutions and the health care they provide, particularly to women; it is unacceptable that the Dáil begins every day with a prayer that is not representative of all elected Members or citizens; and it is unacceptable that our national broadcaster, funded by the State, subjects citizens of all faiths and none to the Angelus bells twice daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">These are relics of a bygone era. If Tuam has shown us anything, it is that the State must take responsibility for its citizens and the church has no legitimacy in the health care or education of these citizens. We must grow up and separate church from State.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">Our history shows that unfortunately we have always engaged in infanticide or left unwanted babies and children to die of neglect. Ordnance Survey maps of the island show lisín cemeteries for babies abandoned or killed. This is not just an Irish phenomenon. If one reads <i>Oliver Twist</i> by Charles Dickens one sees similar organisations set up to deal with that reality and the same occurred. There was a 90% mortality rate for the babies and children in those foundling institutions in the centre of London, Covent Garden and elsewhere. Sadly and savagely, that experience may have continued longer into the 20th century in Ireland than in other countries. I would argue that is because of the shadow of the Famine and the fear of having a child who may not have had a father to provide for it. The poverty in this State in the 20th century created a particular culture such that families, and fathers – and men are at the centre of this – told a girl who got pregnant that she must take the boat, have a shotgun wedding or have the baby and put it into a home. As a people we are all part of that culture, it goes back to our grandparents and great grandparents. It was the exact same in Bethany, a Protestant home, as in Bessborough, a Catholic home. Families in Irish society of every church and none told a young woman they could not afford for her to have a child because they could not stand over the shame of the illegitimacy and the poverty. That was totally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> James Deeny, the Chief Medical Officer in 1944, saw what was happening in Bessborough and brought it to a halt. He said it was a disgrace and had to stop. The assistant secretary in the Department of Health, Joseph Robins, catalogued that history in real detail. The centre of our State recorded what had happened. We have to admit, and it is difficult to admit, that we were so neglectful, so willing to ignore the reality of those thousands of deaths of babies who were neglected although they were put into care. We need to examine every one of those homes to recognise the reality and learn the lessons from the lack of care in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> This raises wider questions about today. Are we blind to the reality of a woman being pregnant in her early 20s? She cannot afford a home. Are we creating an economy or society that allows a 21 or 22 year old woman easily raise a child? Among lone parents 58% are at risk of poverty. Let us look at ourselves, our society and economy and ask whether we really value mothers and stand up for babies and children. We are better in that we could not now turn a blind eye to deaths of babies on that scale. We live in a more transparent, honest and less poor society. We need to strive to record that and learn the lessons from it. This week has been remarkably difficult and harrowing. Grace's story makes us ask whether we have really learnt the lessons, whether we are really providing due care. We must look after those who are still alive and bear the scars of that system, but we must also try to create a different system which values motherhood and babies and creates the conditions in which if one does have a child, whatever the circumstances, it is cared for, celebrated and supported and which, instead of being driven solely by economic interests, might centre on the needs of the child.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">As a public representative from Tuam and a Minister of State I can say the past week has been pretty sad for the people of Tuam. It is a milestone in this saga that the evidence is now coming forward which verifies what we have all been told about. I thank the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, for saying the commission will be reconsidered and its terms of reference scoped to see what more can be done. I salute the tenacity and determination of Catherine Corless who first brought these horrific facts to light. We owe her a great debt of thanks for what she has done for our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> It is clear the events that happened in Ireland were covered up and not spoken about for years. The result is that innocent victims, mothers and babies were outcasts. I have listened to the stories of people who survived and family members, not only in Tuam but throughout the country, and they are not pretty.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> I was educated in Tuam and it is a fantastic town. The people are fantastic. I am very proud to know so many people in Tuam and to represent the town. I am also mindful of any negativity that might attach to the town. We also have to take into account the sadness visited on the people who live in proximity to this grave and the site of this home and how they have been put under the spotlight in recent years and days. We are reaching the stage where the truth will come out.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I have listened intently to every speaker here this morning and heard the words "the truth", "we have questions to answer", and "let us get the truth out". By chance I met a man in Dublin last Sunday who is a survivor of the Tuam mother and baby home. He spent five years there and was then fostered and survived a tough time as a boy. Today he lives in Dublin with his wife and has two children and, I think, three grandchildren. We had a good discussion. Before we finished I asked him what he wants now. He said all he wanted was to hear people say to him that they are sorry for what they did to him and to his mother who is now deceased.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> It is very simple. We public representatives need to leave no stone unturned to find the truth and I have every confidence in the Government and this Minister that we will find it. We will do this together. We owe it to the children. Let us make sure their deaths and the circumstances in which they died were not in vain. I pray that from the desperate discoveries will come hope and a determination in our society never to tolerate or repeat these atrocities.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">Nuair a bhí mé ag déanamh na hardteistiméireachta, d'fhoglaim mé píosa filíochta a d'fhoilsigh Pádraig Mac Piarais, dár teideal "Ochón, a Dhonncha". Deputies might remember the poem, which begins:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_122">Ochón, a Dhonncha, mo mhíle cogarach, fén bhfód seo sínte</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_123">Fód an doichill ina luí ar do cholainn bhig, mo loma-sceimhle!</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_124">Dá mbeadh an codladh so i gCill na Dromad ort nó in uaigh san Iarthar</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_125">Mo bhrón do bhogfadh, cé gur mhór mo dhochar, is ní bheinn id' dhiaidh air.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The poem is about a father's loss of his child and the burial of that child in a foreign land. I think it brings out the pathos, suffering, pain and loss of a father who loved his son and knew he could probably never visit him again. I mention the poem to make a comparison with the loss, pain and suffering that the mothers and fathers of the children in Tuam went through for all of their lives, never to be forgotten by them and never to be remembered by others. Those families had to face an appalling vista. While I accept and acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, is doing the work she has to do in this regard, and I have no problem with that, I cannot stress enough that we have to allow for the proper respect for the families. The poem I have quoted outlines the heartbreak and hurt suffered by parents when they lose a child in any circumstances. In the case of Tuam, we are talking about the most appalling, outrageous, disgusting and disgraceful way for a child to be separated from his or her mother and father.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> When a press release a couple of years ago indicated that "yeah, a few bones were found", this seemed to suggest that the people who were buried on this site died hundreds of years ago, or perhaps that they were not even human remains at all. It is appalling that the bodies of these children were placed in a sewage pit or container. What an appalling vista. I believe in the Christian message of "suffer little children to come unto me". I am sure some of those involved in the Tuam home must have believed in it as well but to place the bodies of human beings in such a location was the supreme uncivilised insult that could be visited on anyone. Like everyone else, I have very strong feelings and concerns about this matter. Was there no voice in the church? Was there no nun, priest or bishop to speak up, to inquire into this affair or to look into this religious congregation? Was there no teacher in the local school to raise a question? Did anybody raise a concern? We believe the death rate among these children was twice the national average. Children in this care home were twice as likely to die as children nationally in this age cohort. This fundamental question must be resolved. We must get at the truth of this. I ask the church and the sisters, as a voluntary admission of wrong here, to place all of their records in the domain of the commission so that we can look into the hearts and minds of those people. I cannot believe in my heart that no nun, priest, work person or parent asked what the hell was going on in the home. Were they all mute? Were they all silent? I do not believe they would have been. I think we need to hear those voices to give us some semblance of the nightmare of death that befell these tragic families.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> I welcome the work of the commission. My final point is that the disturbing and concerning suffering of children that we are debating, which I am sure is keeping families awake at night, is continuing in a different form in the modern Ireland of 2017. Hundreds of homeless people in this city have nowhere decent to lay their heads. Children are walking the streets. Families have been split up and are unable to live as families. It is entirely unacceptable that children with disabilities cannot get speech therapy and physiotherapy or the decent and proper schools they need. When I contact a most caring medical person in my constituency, it is most annoying to have to ask why children with intellectual disabilities who need special dental care and have been suffering continuous pain for years cannot get the mouth operations under anaesthetic that they need. I am told the question that needs to be asked about such children is not whether they are banging their heads against the wall, but which children are banging their heads against the wall most often each day. These kinds of services are not being provided by the State to the children in our society who are most vulnerable and most in need. We need to change the way we do things in this country. All of us must step up to the mark, regardless of our politics. The shameful and appalling vista of the past is visiting us in a different way today. We must stand up for the rights of the most disadvantaged people in our society. They are being trampled on by the system, by the HSE and by the political and institutional response to these issues. I do not mean to be personal when I say that. In my view, we are not treating people as proper human beings.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, for sharing time with me. I do not think there is a person in Ireland who has not been touched by the story that has emerged from Tuam in recent days. Those of us who come from the local area are aware that this has been said for a number of years. As the Minister of State said, Catherine Corless deserves to be commended on persisting with this and keeping it going when questions were being asked. I think the people of Tuam will get together. They deserve the truth and they need clarification. As others have said, the truth needs to come out. I think the State needs to apologise for the horrendous things that went on in previous years. We need to make sure the people of Tuam are treated fairly. I commend the Minister, Deputy Zappone, on what she has done so far. I advise her to stay with this issue rather than letting her officials who are not really at the coalface deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> Many years ago, we lived in an Ireland where gardaí, priests and teachers were looked up to as gods. Unfortunately, these things happened in Tuam and in other places. Somebody told me yesterday evening he would have been in the same circumstances only for his grandfather. When the local priest came to the house after his mother gave birth to him, his grandfather said "he will be all right, father; we will look after them". The parish priest landed a few days later. They wanted to take his mother away. It is very easy to stand up here and blame the State for everything. The actions of the orders in Tuam at the time were totally outrageous, to be frank. Deputy O'Dowd referred to the role of local teachers and neighbours in the Ireland we used to live in. During that era, people were worried about what the neighbours would say. I think the parents of those people also need to reflect on what they did. They should have made sure those people were not put into these situations. I heard a woman saying in a radio interview yesterday that she was not allowed to say goodbye to her child, which is totally beyond belief. Although what went on at that time was totally wrong, there is a need for balance. Previous speakers basically said that the religious did nothing right at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">I can say I was educated in a school it set up and it was sound. What was done wrong was very wrong but not every single thing was wrong. There was a comment about saying a prayer in here. I am no holy Joe but if one does not want to go in for it, do not go in for it; if one wants to stay out, stay out; if one wants to say the prayer, stay in. These debacles are going on all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> The Minister has done well over recent days in difficult circumstances. The whole State apologised and every Deputy here is united on the matter. I ask the Minister to work with the people of Tuam and listen to the people who have been affected. She should listen to the harrowing stories, bring her face to it and work with those people. Whatever needs to be done to resolve the matter should be accomplished in a compassionate and fair manner for those people. This has been hanging over them for years and we need finality and the truth. We must ensure that what has been done wrong will never happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> We can consider areas like Ballaghaderreen, which has refugees coming next week but the required services will not be in place. This is a problem for a child psychologist. A person came to me 18 years ago when the priests were at the crack of saying children had not been reared correctly. Years ago anybody who committed suicide could not be brought to a church, and that has not even been spoken about in here. We should be ashamed of those actions and remember the affected people today, as well as what went on in Tuam. Not everybody in the orders or society then was bad but we must learn from our mistakes and make things right. I ask the Minister to treat those people with compassion.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">Before making my substantive contribution I take issue with Deputy Bríd Smith's comment earlier on Deputy Micheál Martin's apparent "road to Damascus". His reaction and comments are genuine, as are those of every other Deputy on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> We still do not know the full extent of these horrors but we know the remains of small babies and infants were found, numbering in their hundreds, in septic tanks at the site of the Bon Secours mother and baby home in Tuam. I have heard the term "buried" used in regard to these infants but I take issue with it, as the use of the word "burial" suggests some level of decency. There was no decency here and these children were disregarded as human waste and something to be got rid of, reduced and dehumanised. What a disgusting black mark on our society. Can we imagine the fear, forced shame, stigma, isolation and loneliness of these women? That is what our State and church inflicted on our women. Where were the men in all of this? There was no responsibility laid at their door and it was as if these women impregnated themselves and the babies only had one parent.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> We have come a long way in this regard but not far enough. Women still bear most of the responsibility for children and there is still a stigma on single mothers, who experience shame, isolation and loneliness. We can look to the budget from a couple of years ago which saw cuts for lone parents, carer's allowance and child benefit in one fell swoop. It is worth reflecting on how we, as a society, continue to treat our women poorly, particularly those who are single mothers.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> What was uncovered in Tuam is only the tip of the iceberg. We do not know exactly how these babies died and it seems likely they were left to starve or die in the cold, as the mortality rate is too high to suggest otherwise. It sends a shiver through me to think of the mothers who gave birth in these facilities. We can think of the lack of care, the unsafe procedures, the lack of aftercare and the fact the babies were stolen and sold afterwards. We must take our search further as it is very unlikely this only happened in Tuam. It is likely other mother and baby homes will uncover a similar horror. It gives me no pleasure to say it but we must uncover the full extent of these horrors in order that we, as a country, can begin to heal.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The church and the Bon Secours nuns have much to answer for. Society was complicit in this but why was that? The church instilled fear in people and demanded that people conform to its way. If they did not, they were excommunicated. It was the church and the nuns who decided these mothers and babies were not deserving of humane treatment, love and kindness or, ultimately, life. I am sure the irony of this is not lost on people today in the context of the current debate. No religion advocates for the abuse, torture and murder of women and children. I am not particularly religious but if the church and nuns believe what they were doing was required by their religion, it came from their skewed interpretation of Catholicism and Christianity. The State does not get off scot free with this as it was complicit in every way and funded these horrific facilities and, to use the Taoiseach's own words, the "chambers of horror".</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> I support the call from other Deputies to see a separation of church and State and I want to see real engagement by the Bon Secours nuns and the church in a full investigation. There should be full co-operation at every juncture. If they are truly sorry for the pain and suffering they inflicted, the very least they can do is apologise unreservedly and compensate the surviving victims, using the substantial funds we all know they possess. We cannot now in any way seek to bury the sins of the church and the Bon Secours nuns simply because we do not want to talk about it. I fail to see how An Garda Síochána could not be involved and, if appropriate, prosecutions should be brought on anyone who may have committed a crime against women and children in these facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> This is a very dark but recent past and people are still living with the effects today. Lives were lost or destroyed and families and communities were devastated. We need a formal State apology and a formal apology from the church and Bon Secours orders. There must be a full and proper investigation in Tuam and further afield, prosecutions where appropriate and compensation to victims with the church and Bon Secours order meeting their responsibilities appropriately. This must be done as speedily as possible and with the utmost sensitivity to the remaining survivors and their families.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">The 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic promised to cherish all children of the nation equally. Historians continue to debate whether the word "children" should be ascribed to a literal or figurative meaning, whether children or citizens in general. Whichever is favoured, there is no doubt that children in Ireland were often second class citizens. The shame of Tuam casts a dark shadow over how Irish society treated the most vulnerable of its citizens, children and women in institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> The harrowing and gut-wrenching stories of women in Tuam should not have surprised us. After all, many children growing up in the 1960s and 1970s were told that if they did not behave, they would be relegated to sit with the children of sin. Irish society knew or at least was aware of the hell on Earth being inflicted on defenceless, highly vulnerable children and women in institutions. What was their crime only to be born to an unmarried mother or an impoverished family? Poverty is an underlying factor that continues to propel some children into State care. Circumstances of birth resulted in many children from single parent families or lower socioeconomic backgrounds being received into care. An alarming number of these children were systematically abused and exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> The legacy of shameful indifference is graphically illustrated in the Ryan report, and the scale and plight of women in Tuam implicates all of Irish society. A chilling feature of the accounts of the plight of what were referred to as "fallen women" has now emerged, along with the unquestioned and apparently unquestionable moral authority of so-called Christian care providers, which had a reckless disregard for vulnerable women and child welfare. We will have another inquiry to follow many reports that prove generations of children were exposed to endemic abuse in institutions run by the State or by religious orders for the State. In 1993, Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness set out the horror of family life for a young girl in the Kilkenny incest case and recommended constitutional change. Regrettably, it took two decades before a proposal to amend the Constitution to protect children was put to the people. In 2009, the commission to inquire into child abuse published its long-awaited report and in 2011 we had the report into the Magdalen laundries. Despite all these reports and inquiries, certain recommendations remain unimplemented. Children remain vulnerable in our society today. There are an insufficient number of social welfare workers for vulnerable children and an insufficient number of people to speak out for children who cannot speak for themselves today.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">We, on this side of the House, extend our sincere sympathies to the family of Annmarie O'Brien and her daughter, Paris, on their tragic deaths in the fire in Clondalkin yesterday. We also extend our condolences to the family of Holly and Jordan, the other two children to die in the horrific fire. We pray that their mother, Biddy O'Brien, will fully recover from her injuries. The Garda and the Dublin Fire Brigade are continuing their investigations and it is in everybody's interests that the cause of the fire be established as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> Dublin Fire Brigade provides emergency ambulance services in the Dublin city and county area by arrangement with Dublin City Council and the National Ambulance Service. Dublin Fire Brigade has a proud tradition of providing this fire-based ambulance service in the capital. International best practice indicates that combining fire, rescue and emergency medical services greatly improves the response to a crisis. In the Dublin Fire Brigade, 830 firefighters are trained paramedics in a position to provide immediate emergency medical assistance and the benefits of this integrated service are obvious to everyone. The chief executive of Dublin City Council, Owen Keegan, has stated he wishes to see a transfer of all call taking and dispatching of ambulances to the national control centre in Tallaght. He stated this was the view of the chief executives of the other local authorities, although it is not agreed by the councillors in those local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> The HIQA report raised concerns about the operation of two ambulance services in the Dublin area and called for enhanced integration of service provision. It is clear, therefore, that co-ordination and integration between the Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service is required. Significant investment is also needed in the fire brigade and ambulance capacity in the Dublin area. Investment is needed in ambulances, personnel, vehicles and technology. Last Saturday, rallies took place at all the fire brigade centres throughout Dublin, which demonstrated the support for the retention of the ambulance service by Dublin Fire Brigade. Impact and SIPTU have called off strike action, following the intervention of Kieran Mulvey.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Does the Tánaiste agree that the ambulance service should be retained in Dublin City Council? The expert panel published its report in 2015 and made recommendations for the future of the ambulance service. This provides a mechanism for co-ordination and governance. I hope the relevant Ministers will deal with the issue once and for all. It has been dragging on for too long and we need action.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">I join the Deputy in extending my sympathies to the families, the young children, the mum and her friend, who is seriously ill. I was saddened to hear about the tragic fire in Clondalkin and the circumstances surrounding it. My thoughts are with all of those involved, their relatives and friends. I am sure I speak for everyone in the House when I extend our sympathy to all the families. I spent time there this morning meeting the gardaí who are investigating, and further forensic analysis is being done. I met the staff of Sonas, which has been providing services for 25 years to women in vulnerable situations. They are devastated by what has happened. They are offering every support they can to the other families who, thankfully, escaped the fire. I also pay tribute to the emergency services personnel who arrived very quickly at the scene of the fire. We await the results of the forensic and Garda investigations. Today, our thoughts are with the relatives and friends of those who so tragically lost their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> The Dublin city manager informed the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that SIPTU had served notice of potential stoppages on Dublin City Council on 6 May. The Departments have been heavily involved. I do not want this to go ahead. The Department is primarily concerned with ensuring local authorities are meeting their obligations in respect of their statutory fire service and fire safety responsibilities. The provision of health services, including the provision of ambulance services is, of course, the responsibility of the HSE operating under the remit of the Department of Health. A number of Departments are involved. We want to ensure any discussion on Dublin Fire Brigade and the ambulance services focuses on addressing the HIQA report issues. We must respect the excellent and proud tradition of Dublin Fire Brigade. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, are examining the recommendations. It is critical that there be no reduction in front-line ambulance services and there is no intention that there should be.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">I thank the Tánaiste. The expert panel on pre-hospital emergency care services Dublin published its report in 2015. Does the Tánaiste agree that the findings of the expert panel should be implemented as a matter of urgency, given that the report provides a mechanism to address the operational inefficiencies and the issue of a fully integrated ambulance service in Dublin? Will the two relevant Ministers commence immediately, by way of the new governance arrangements set out by the expert panel, a process to eliminate the shortfall in the Dublin Fire Brigade available capacity to meet demand in order that the use of fire appliances to respond to ambulance calls is reserved for calls that are clinically appropriate? Can the Department and Dublin City Council provide funding directly for the operation of the ambulance service provided by the Dublin Fire Brigade and can the funding be increased to reflect the costs of the service?</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> As the saying goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Nobody in the HSE has any capacity to take over the ambulance service currently administered by the Dublin Fire Brigade.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Will the Government and the two relevant Ministers intervene in respect of this matter, sort it out and leave Dublin Fire Brigade to continue to do what it has done for the past 100 years?</p>

          <p eId="para_154">The first key point I will make to the Deputy is that we are investing more in the National Ambulance Service. I quite agree with Deputy Haughey that we do not want to lose any of the excellence and experience that has been built up over the years. We have a series of recommendations that will be discussed and considered by both Ministers. The funding considerations will form part of those discussions. The issue is clearly being taken very seriously by both of the Ministers and their Departments. Each of them has responsibilities in respect of it and funding is continuing. There will be no reduction in front-line ambulance services. That is critical given the demands on our hospitals. Yesterday, it was made clear in the House that engagement will take place when the recommendations come to the Ministers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_155">I wish to also express my deepest sympathy to the O'Brien family for the tragic loss of their three children and their sister in Clondalkin yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Of the homeless families in Dublin, 60% have been in emergency accommodation for more than six months and 40% have been in bed and breakfasts, hostels or hotels for over one year. There are 138 families who have spent more than 18 months in emergency accommodation and 40 families have now entered their third year of homelessness. Many of these families are living in inappropriate, unsuitable and insecure accommodation. As the Tánaiste knows, the number of complaints about the accommodation has doubled. Families are being forced into accommodation with damp rooms, blood-stained sheets, mice and even cockroaches. Can the Tánaiste, or any Member, imagine living with young children in these conditions for this length of time? Some of the 2,500 homeless children have spent more of their lives in emergency accommodation than in a stable home. Meanwhile some 198,000 homes lie vacant across the State. In Dublin, 40,000 homes are empty, which is almost 40 houses for every homeless family. This is not new information because we have known about it since the 2011 census, the same year the Tánaiste took office. Yet for five years during which the previous Government was in office, the Tánaiste did nothing to bring these homes back into use. That is why 1,200 families and 2,500 children are sleeping in emergency accommodation. It is also why there are 100,000 households languishing on the councils' waiting lists and why thousands of families who are facing home repossessions or spiralling rents are now at risk of homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> The Government has started to take some action but the plans are not ambitious enough. They are chronically underfunded and they will not meet their targets. The Peter McVerry Trust is hosting a vacant homes conference today. The trust has nine policy recommendations it wants the Government to include in the upcoming vacant homes plan. The Simon Community has published a ten-point plan to tackle the unacceptable number of vacant units. Both of these groups are urging Government to do more to get empty homes back into use. My questions to the Tánaiste are very simple. Will she commit to studying carefully the recommendations of those two organisations? More importantly, will she commit to publishing a vacant homes plan that is ambitious and properly funded to provide the homes so desperately needed by those families in emergency accommodation and by those at risk of homelessness?</p>

        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_33" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_158">The Government plans are ambitious and funded. The Government recognises the significant challenges facing the housing market in Ireland. That is why we brought forward Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which sets out a very practical and absolutely readily implementable set of time-based actions. This is what we are actually doing. It is a plan that will deliver for people by addressing the shortage of affordable housing, rising rents and the unacceptable high levels of homelessness. The reason we need to have Rebuilding Ireland is because of the disastrous and catastrophic policies which were followed previously and which led to the unprecedented property crash, for which we will be paying well into the future. This Government and its predecessor have acted on these issues. We have been putting the money aside to deal with them and there has been practical and detailed engagement by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, with local authorities to ensure that housing will come on stream. That work is certainly under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> I will now turn to the issue of the national vacant housing re-use strategy. First, as Deputy Ó Broin is aware, there is already a commitment to compile a register of vacant units across the State to identify the number, location and reasons for longer-term vacancies, that is, units vacant for over six months in high-demand areas. There is a range of actions already being undertaken by the Government to bring those vacant houses back into use. The Housing Agency is due to report back on this measure within weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Having said that, I wish to congratulate the Peter McVerry Trust for all the work it does. The trust is hosting a conference today at which it will be highlighting particular issues and also the measures designed to bring vacant properties into use. We will look at the range of recommendations that will emerge by the conference. A number of initiatives are already in place which are designed to bring vacant properties back into use. There is the buy-and-renew initiative, which facilitates local authorities to purchase and renew housing units in need of remediation and make them available for social housing. That initiative has funding of €25 million in 2017 and €50 million for next year. There is also the purchase by the Housing Agency of vacant buy-to-let properties on the portfolios of financial institutions and investor for use as social housing. There is funding of €70 million in place for that measure. There is a range of measures already in place. The vacant site levy will be charged from 2018 onwards, with the first bills being collected in 2019. The vacant site levy will ensure that the levy will be charged at the rate of 3% of the market value of the site. I mention this because it is associated. There are many initiatives already being implemented in order to ensure that those vacant houses come back into use. Every local authority is already working on that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_161">I know the Tánaiste has difficulty with housing statistics. She told the Dáil two weeks ago that 8,500 social houses were currently being built across the State but the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government's own figures clearly state that the figure is only 1,892. That is a very a big difference and I am sure the Tánaiste would like to correct the record of the House today. We would welcome her doing that. Just like the unambitious social housing programme, the Government's vacant home schemes are simply not enough. The three schemes spoken of by the Tánaiste promise to deliver, at best, 6,400 homes over six years. Even if the Government meets these targets - I do not believe it will do so - it is only 3% of the total vacant stock out there, and it will take six years, while we have thousands of children in emergency accommodation. There are 1,100 vacant homes available to buy from AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, and yet the Government is only purchasing 200 units.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> On the "Morning Ireland" programme this morning, Ms Marie O'Sullivan from Cork pleaded with the Government to take action to ensure that she and thousands of families like hers do not become homeless. Will the Government finally accept responsibility for the housing crisis that the Tánaiste and her colleagues have created? Will they do more than the Tánaiste has currently outlined to ensure that families who desperately need homes do not end up in insecure and inappropriate emergency accommodation?</p>

          <p eId="para_163">There are some other statistics that Deputy Ó Broin could have quoted, but which he would, of course, never quote, about the increased investment in this area. Budget 2017 provides for a 40% increase in the level of funding allocated nationally for housing authorities to manage homeless services - funding of approximately €98 million, compared to an initial provision of €70 million in 2016. That additional funding is so important in this area to support families who might go into homelessness. Another figure Deputy Ó Broin could quote is that housing authorities will have assisted in excess of 2,700 sustainable exits from homelessness during 2016. That is a record number of exits.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">Clearly, there is enormous demand, but there are several other statistics which I have given the Deputy today, such as the €32 million available for the repair and leasing scheme. That will bring back into use 800 vacant properties as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_171">Ireland is one of the leading countries in Europe for instances of phenylketonuria, PKU. Approximately one in every 4,500 babies born in Ireland has PKU in contrast to the United Kingdom, where the figure is approximately one in every 12,000, and further afield in the United States, where the condition is even rarer, affecting only one in every 15,000 newborns each year. In Ireland we follow diet-for-life, whereby each PKU sufferer is continuously assessed from birth to determine how many grammes of protein they can have on a daily basis. This assessment is determined from blood tests, as well as weight and height measurements and these tests are ongoing for life.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> In order to facilitate the healthy growth and development of PKU sufferers to supplement the often very low amount of protein they can have, foods are available on prescription through the long-term illness scheme, for example, pasta, pizza, flour milk and bread. Despite the fact Ireland has one of the highest incidences of PKU in Europe, it has one of the most limited varieties of foods available on the long-term illness scheme in comparison with our European neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Given all of this, and in order to follow a full low-protein diet, it is necessary to purchase much low-protein food from supermarkets. Unfortunately, many of these foods, for example, Violife vegan cheese, fresh fruit and vegetables, are very expensive. The PKU diet is extremely challenging for PKU patients and their families, and the consequences of not adhering to the diet are very serious. Untreated PKU can lead to brain damage, intellectual disabilities, behavioural symptoms and seizures. Ultimately, facilitating PKU patients to adhere to their diet through the provision of a good range of medical and low-protein foods, as well as innovative medicines, will improve their outcomes, resulting in lower overall costs to the health care system, as well as optimising their ability to contribute to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> As previously mentioned, we have a very limited list of foods available on the long-term illness scheme. Will the Tánaiste outline what is the long-term illness scheme budget for PKU products each year? How is this list managed and why is the variety of foods available in neighbouring countries not available here? Will it ever be a reality to have a PKU patient or their carer involved in the decision making around the foods available to them? PKU patients, who are the end-users, need to be invited to give their input as to the value or otherwise of foods of which they, after all, are the consumers. It needs to be acknowledged that some of the foods available on the long-term illness scheme are of much poorer quality than those available in other European countries, a prime example of this being the quality of breads, a staple of any diet. We should also note that an increased selection of foods of a better quality does not necessarily equate to increased costs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_44" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_175">I thank the Deputy. As we know, PKU is a very debilitating condition and sufferers must have an extremely low-protein diet to avoid the worst effects of the disease. In Ireland we have a very comprehensive screening programme because, as the Deputy rightly said, there is a very high incidence compared with other countries. What is a needed is a lifetime management process for patients who have this condition, known as diet-for-life, which provides continuous individual monitoring and assessment of patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Low protein and technical dietary items for PKU patients are available free of charge under the long-term illness scheme. The Deputy asked about the scale of that availability and about the amount of money allocated at present. The most recent data available show that expenditure on these products for one year from December 2015 to November 2016 was approximately €4.8 million. In 2016, an expert group was formed which was drawn from both hospital and community settings. Revised guidelines on the application for reimbursement of clinical nutritional products was looked at and in November last year, the HSE published those guidelines and suppliers were notified that the applications were being accepted. A number of new applications were received and it is hoped this will broaden the list of the products available. In January 2017 the expert group considered the applications that have been received and the applicants will be notified of the outcome in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> When a product is approved for addition to the reimbursement list, it is seamlessly available to a person with PKU under their long-term illness eligibility. The next opportunity for submitting applications for clinical nutritional products to be added to that reimbursement list is expected in June. As for the drug sapropterin, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics is currently considering a new application in that regard which it received in February. The HSE will be considering that and deciding on the reimbursement in regard to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> The Deputy raises an issue which is of concern to a huge number of people throughout the country. Quite an amount of work has been done on this in terms of the recommendations of the working group being examined by the HSE, and decisions are expected in the next period.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_45">

          <p eId="para_179">I ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, to also listen to this part of my question. Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 years with a severe disability who requires ongoing care and attention substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. It is not means tested. Why do some PKU patients receive domiciliary care allowance while others are refused? What are the evidence-based criteria used by the deciding officers? Why do some families have to go through the appeals process? As all PKU sufferers suffer the same condition with the same restraints and consequences, why is there not a blanket domiciliary care payment for all PKU sufferers from birth to 16 years?</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Given the increased costs for PKU sufferers over 16 years, it is likely that having received domiciliary care allowance up to this age, they will be in receipt of disability allowance when they apply for it after the age of 16. Obviously, with growth comes increased appetite, which equals increased costs. What are the evidence-based criteria used by the deciding officers in cases of sufferers aged over 16?</p>

          <p eId="para_182">I will finish shortly, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle. PKU is a genetically rare disease. The HSE wants to set up a working group to assess the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies, for example, Kuvan, which can greatly improve the quality of life for PKU sufferers. Has this group been put into action? The national rare disease plan recommends the setting up of a national budget to fund such treatments so there is no impact on individual hospital budgets, for example, at Temple Street hospital. Has the HSE made any progress to date? I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his indulgence.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">Kuvan is the other name for the drug I mentioned earlier. That was first sought in 2009 and it was refused due to lack of evidence of cost effectiveness at that time. As I said, a new application is currently under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> The Deputy asked about domiciliary care allowance, which is payable in respect of children under 16 years with a severe disability requiring care and attention. As the Government announced last week, there will now be an automatic medical card for those children receiving domiciliary care allowance, which is a very important support to parents in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> In response to the question about children with PKU, the approach is that no specific disability automatically qualifies a child for domiciliary care allowance. Eligibility is based on the care needs, not on the disability <i>per se</i>. Of course, the reality with young children and adults who have PKU is that the condition can vary quite substantially. For example, the various food products and interventions can be very successful for one child but not for another.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">When seeing the child, the medical assessor has to take all of this into account. It is medical assessors, who are qualified and experienced doctors, who examine the application and the supporting medical evidence and make the decision. The deciding officer reviews the medical evidence and the details of the child's needs as outlined in the application form and assesses the care needs of the child. It is a very individual assessment based on the individual care needs of the child, as opposed to a category like PKU, or indeed any other disability.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">Will the Tánaiste give us her assessment of a detailed timeline of when we will hold a referendum regarding the repeal of the eighth amendment to the Constitution? I have seen quotes attributed to the Tánaiste, and I hope I do quote her incorrectly, that I agree with. The Tánaiste said "the Constitution is not the place to resolve complex issues like this". She went on to say that "it would be more meaningful to talk about what do you replace it with". I agree with both statements. We will vote in different ways on the Bill introduced by Bríd Smith, which the Green Party co-signed. I fundamentally sense that a 14-year prison sentence, which we have at present, is just a sign of the latest legal iteration of the difficulties that the original eighth amendment has caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> We may be in agreement, though others may not, that the Citizens' Assembly has been doing very useful work. I believe that process has been helpful in terms of allowing people to come in to share ideas and views. Its members have one meeting to go and then they have a certain period of time to present their information to the House. A lot of people marched yesterday. Looking at how we do other things here, such as the water issue, which has gone to a similar Oireachtas committee to the one proposed for a referendum on repealing the eighth amendment, there is a tendency here for timelines to slip. People are already saying that there will not be a referendum this year and that it will more likely be next year. I believe it is important for us to have a reasoned debate and to respect both sides. That is how I come to any discussion. I have friends on both sides and with a whole range of different views.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I believe it is important for us to give some sense of direction around times. I would be interested to hear the Tánaiste's personal views as to what the timeline is. How long will an Oireachtas committee be given to report back? Is it just the committee that will be involved in that process or are there other mechanisms by which Members could share their views? In the forming of a preferred option for the Government, how might the Government work with the other sides of the House? There are different views on all sides of this House on this issue. I believe it will better serve our people if we can have an approach on the referendum that continues in the House the dialogue that has occurred in the Citizens' Assembly. How do we do that? How do we achieve a reasoned debate in our public dealings?</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Critically at this stage more than anything else, when will that happen? This Government's timeline is also in the public's mind. There is a real risk that we will end up frustrating a lot of people on all sides of the argument if we cannot order our business on this issue in a way that sees that work done within the lifetime of this Dáil. I would argue that that is a real risk at this stage. I am interested to hear the views of the Tánaiste. She has played a long role in women's issues in this State. As Tánaiste, she has a critical position. Can she provide us her detailed assessment of a timeline? When would a referendum be held and how do we get there?</p>

          <p eId="para_191">With regard to the Bill before the House, the idea of a €1 sanction for the intentional destruction of human life and of a Bill that would take away all discretion from a judge who would be dealing with such matters is not the direction we should go in. I believe that taking away all discretion from a trial judge is completely wrong. I believe that that Bill would protect abusers and people who order abortifacients over the Internet and use them inappropriately. That is certainly not the direction for us to go in. I do not believe this issue should be dealt with in a piecemeal fashion by changing some of the legislation we have in place at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> As the Deputy said, this is an extremely complex issue. I recognise the very deeply-held views on every side of this. We all care deeply about this issue. I was part of the last Government that dealt with this issue for the first time properly in legislation through the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which regulated access to a termination of pregnancy if a woman's life was at risk from a threat to her physical or mental health. We all know there are many concerns at present for women, particularly regarding fatal foetal abnormality, cases of rape, incest, as well as very complex issues we undoubtedly need to address in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> The Government has set up the Citizens' Assembly. Like the Deputy, I pay tribute to the work of that assembly. It has been extremely thorough. We will certainly all have to get the full report from that Citizens' Assembly in order to be as well informed as the members of that assembly are at present following the detailed discussions they have had. It has been a very worthwhile process. It will be extremely worthwhile to see what they recommend. The assembly has dealt with it as the first issue on its agenda at the request of the Government. That is important. The issue has been debated many times in this House over the past number of years but the approach the Government has taken at present is to establish the Citizens' Assembly to review Article 40.3.3°. I certainly look forward to the outcome of that examination of Article 40.3.3° and to participating in the arrangements we will make in the Oireachtas. Clearly, we have said that we will set up a special committee. We have had good precedence with regard to that. The committee that Senator Buttimer chaired at the time had very respectful and inclusive discussions. I expect that is what will happen based on the outcome of the report from the Citizens' Assembly, which will be with us in the near future. It will then be up to the Oireachtas committee, the Business Committee and all of us to consider the best way forward in terms of the discussions in the House and whether a referendum will follow from that.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I will not get into an argument today about the Bill before the House, save to note that while I respect the Tánaiste's view, I have a similar competing view that a 14-year sentence is not appropriate in our Statute Book. I will put that matter aside. The Tánaiste's party has a particular responsibility in this issue given that it was her party that introduced the original referendum in 1983 against the advice of the Attorney General at the time, who saw, articulated and raised concerns about the legal difficulties that it would present. I do not disagree with anything the Tánaiste said after that.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> I return, however, to the core question. I believe it is important for Deputy Fitzgerald, as Tánaiste, Minister for Justice and Equality and as a women who has played an important role in the whole issue of women's affairs, to outline what her expected timeline is for the referendum. It is important to get a calm and good quality debate in public, as well as within the Citizens' Assembly and in the Oireachtas committee. There must be some sort of understanding among members of the public as to what the timeline is. Can the Tánaiste address that key single question I asked? What is her expectation as to when a referendum might be held? Given that the Tánaiste said that the Constitution is not the right place to address complex issues like this, when does she intend to rectify that matter?</p>

          <p eId="para_196">Let us look at what the Government has done already. The matter has been referred to the Citizens' Assembly. The timeline we are operating to at present is that we will have the report from the Citizens' Assembly in the first half of 2017. It will then be referred to the committee, which will be expected to report back within six months. That is the current timeline that we have, which brings us towards the end of this year. It will then be a matter for the Business Committee to decide how the issue will be taken forward in the Dáil for further Oireachtas deliberations. Those are the details of the timeline that we have at present. The report from the Citizens' Assembly is due in the first half of 2017, the special Oireachtas committee is to report back within six months and then other decisions will follow from that, including the very important debate here in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">In section 5 on page 60 of A Programme for a Partnership Government dealing with health, there is a heading that reads "Improving Waiting Times for Hospital Procedures". There are all sorts of commitments given in that particular section.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> Today, we learn that over 614,000 are on hospital waiting lists and the figure is up 11,460 since January. These patients are waiting for inpatient and day care procedures as well as outpatient appointments. We are informed that the HSE is preparing waiting list action plans for 2017 and that the Minister is currently reviewing the draft plans. The Minister should start reviewing them quickly because 2017 is well under way. Behind the statistics there is utter anxiety and pain for many ill people. The situation is obviously getting worse. The population is ageing and there is increasing demand for health services, but all of this could have been predicted. Does the Tánaiste agree that more action is now urgently required to deal with this escalating problem?</p>

          <p eId="para_199">Every action is being taken by the Minister and the Department of Health to deal with the ever-increasing demand on our health services. I will offer one example. Previously, 25,000 referrals used to be made per month by general practitioners. The figure is now at 35,000 per month for specialist services. People have higher and higher expectations, but of course we are all concerned about the waiting lists. Every action is being taken by all the local health services and Ministers. Extra clinics are being put in place. Particular initiatives are being taken in respect of the waiting lists for children. By the end of this year, no child who needs a scoliosis operation will be waiting longer than four months. That is a major improvement and comes as a result of a series of actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Clearly, broader issues need to be addressed and are being addressed. Extra money, almost €1 billion, was put into the health service by the Government last year; there was an increase of €1 billion. The bed capacity review is under way. The GP contract needs to be renegotiated. All of these are being dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Let us remember that 1.7 million operations were carried out in the past year for patients throughout the country. Let us consider some of the successes of our health service as well. Day in and day out people are receiving excellent care.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">The programme for Government promises a €42 billion capital investment programme. This includes investment in schools, hospitals, housing and infrastructure. Obviously, all of this is good news for job creation. However, too many construction workers are being forced into bogus self-employment contracts. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has estimated that this has cost the State €80 million annually since 2007. It also clearly undermines workers' rights. Can the Tánaiste tell the House when the report of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, on bogus subcontracted employment will be completed? When will it be published? Most important, will the Government promise to introduce legislation to protect workers and the taxpayer from bogus subcontracting, especially on State funded construction projects?</p>

          <p eId="para_203">That is a joint project involving the Department of Finance, Revenue Commissioners and my Department. My Department has a particular interest because where bogus self-employment exists, we lose out on PRSI. This is because we do not get employer's PRSI. More significantly, the people concerned do not get the same social benefits as they would were they employed. A joint working group is addressing this. I met my officials this morning to discuss it. We expect the report to be published in the next couple of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Having said that, it is important to point out something to the people who are expressing the view that there has been a significant rise in self-employment and that this corresponds to bogus self-employment: the statistics do not support that view. The proportion of people who are self-employed and those employed are approximately the same. The latest CSO quarterly household national survey figures show that the increase in employment was almost entirely in employment rather than self-employment. Therefore, the idea that there has been a vast increase in self-employment figures due to bogus self-employment is not supported by the facts.</p>

It is an application by a person of full age for naturalisation as an Irish citizen. The document clearly states that the application fee is €175. It states that the fee should be paid using a banker's draft and that no postal orders will be accepted. What sort of message does this give out to the people when we are trying to attract them to use our post offices? Could this document be changed? The Government has the power to change it. It is a Government-issued document for people who are applying for naturalisation. Can we please take out that reference? What genius decided that no postal orders should be allowed? A postal order is every bit as good as a banker's draft. It is the same as cash. I want to ask for the genius in question to go back, throw these forms away, light a fire and burn them and then issue new forms indicating that a postal order will be allowed.

The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, was in the House and a farcical situation developed. The Minister of State clearly said he did not have responsibility for the post office service or whether post offices stay open or closed. He said it was the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten. Back three weeks ago, I put this question to the Taoiseach across the floor.

Wind farm proposals are continuing to receive planning permission and are proceeding to construction. The reason for the latest delay is the European Court of Justice's ruling on the Belgian case. It sets a requirement for a strategic environmental assessment. That will take time. The Government is aware of this since October, which is when the European Court of Justice ruled in the case. The Government promised to have guidelines in place within three to six months of coming into office. It is heading towards 12 months in office and the matter is in its programme for Government. We have not seen any effort to move this forward. When will the Government begin the strategic environmental assessment to get this process under way? It will take six to 12 months to carry out the consultation on the strategic environmental assessment and to have the work done. When will it be started? When will we see guidelines in place for wind farms? For our part, we want to see regulations, but we do not even have guidelines. We are operating under guidelines from 2006.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">Pursuant to Standing Order 27E(8) and further to the orders of the Dáil on Tuesday, it is proposed that No. <i>b</i>4, motion re amendment of orders of reference of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, be taken now without debate, followed by No. <i>c</i>4, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the draft Commission of Investigation (Certain matters relative to a disability service in the South East and related matters) Order 2017 (revised). With regard to <i>c</i>4, the following arrangements shall apply. The proceedings, if not previously concluded, will be brought to a conclusion after 40 minutes, and the speeches, which will be confined to a Minister or a Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the parties or group, or a Member nominated in their stead, shall not exceed five minutes each.

          <p eId="para_242">With respect to the proposition on the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, there is simply no reason we should be delaying the work of the committee. We could have and should have finished this week. This is just kicking the can down the road because we cannot get an agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. We are fundamentally opposed to this part of the proposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">It is definitely not agreed because we should be having a debate here today if the Government wants to postpone further the deadline for the water committee. Second, we should not be doing it at all. I guess we have had more than 50 hours of discussion in committee. We have had years of discussion in society and the matter was an important issue during the general election campaign. We have enough evidence to decide to get rid of water charges once and for all. It must be asked, and people are asking this, why we need to postpone things again. People are rightly concerned that this is an opportunity to create space for some sort of backroom deal between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. That is why people will come out onto the streets on Saturday, 8 April. At the very least, we need a debate today on the further postponement.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">In fairness, the water committee has been making substantial progress in a number of areas. There are approximately seven or eight headed areas. We have been making substantial progress with options papers that have been given to us by the Chairman, Senator Ó Céidigh, in regard to public ownership, public engagement and transparency, conservation measures and other issues. The Chairman has sought the advice of the Oireachtas legal counsel in regard to the 2007 Act. As do all my colleagues, I acknowledge the work and hours put into the water committee. I assure the public that we are making significant progress but we are awaiting the advice of the independent legal adviser to the Oireachtas specifically in regard to the 2007 Act.</p>

        <speech by="#RuthCoppinger" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_376">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_377">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to restore the eligibility of all persons born in the island of Ireland for Irish citizenship.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">This Bill would reverse the changes to Irish citizenship law that were implemented in 2005 following the referendum in 2004. The Bill would give the entitlement to Irish citizenship to everyone born on the island of Ireland regardless of their parents' status.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> Throughout Europe there has been an erosion of the rights of immigrants. We see an example this week with the Government's proposed changes to social protection payments to children. In recent decades, there has been a move away from giving people automatic citizenship based on their place of birth. Now, the right to citizenship is generally conditional on who a person's parents are and their status in the State at the time of that person's birth. Citizenship law has increasingly become about a person's bloodline and not where they were born and live. The Bill goes against that trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> The Taoiseach will visit the United States next week to meet President Trump. I do not want him to go, but he is going apparently. The United States is one of the few remaining countries that grants citizenship to people born in the US regardless of their parents' status. In the course of the recent presidential election campaign, President Trump spoke about altering that. Many of the laws that President Trump is advancing have already been implemented in Europe. It is slightly hypocritical of Irish politicians who oppose President Trump altering US citizenship law, owing to the impact it would have on undocumented Irish people, standing over the same law here.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> Why should we reverse this? It is very clear that the 2004 referendum on citizenship was based on a number of myths, some of them xenophobic in nature. The then Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Government was unpopular and was facing into local and European elections. The then Minister for Justice and Law Reform played the race card. We had a referendum on the same day as the local elections that tried to shift the blame for inadequacies in maternity care and health care onto immigrants. There was the myth of birth tourism and even the myth of so-called "anchor babies", people travelling to the country, having a baby and going away again. These myths were pushed by some establishment politicians. Disgustingly, the parties representing the powerful and wealthy during the Celtic tiger scapegoated the most vulnerable asylum seekers during that referendum campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> I was a first-time candidate in the local election in Mulhuddart on the same day as that referendum and I distinctly remember the message being advanced. I was standing in the most diverse, multicultural part of the State. I am proud to say that the Socialist Party at the time stood firmly against that referendum and outlined that immigrants are not to blame for problems in health care and housing. It is the politicians and the capitalist and business class in the country that are to blame.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> Removing a person's status does not help anyone other than the Government and employers, who are then better situated to exploit that individual. Those with precarious immigration status are more likely to be facing precarious work, low pay and poor housing conditions. From 1 January 2023, adults who know nowhere other than Ireland as their home will not be considered Irish citizens. These will be adults who were born, brought up and educated in this country and who will not have the right to vote in referendums and Dáil elections. Will these people have problems in the future in the context of renewing visas? Will they have a status? Are they likely to become our problematic undocumented, concerned about the policies of each incoming Government every few years? At present, a person here must have one parent who has lived in the State for three of the past four years. Time spent here as a student, undocumented or applying for refugee status is not included.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> Between 2005 and 2016 there were 6,419 naturalisations of Irish-born children. Those people would not have had to apply for naturalisation if the law had not been changed following the referendum to which I refer. Naturalisation costs quite a lot of money for families. The fee is €1,125 for adults and €375 for children. I meet many families who have to raise that money. Although it has been speeded up, it is still a bureaucratic process.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> We should send out a message against division and against the erosion of rights for immigrants. It was for this reason that I sought leave to move the Bill.</p>

        <heading>Prohibition of Wild Animals in Circuses Bill 2017: First Stage<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T13:20:00+00:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_390">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_391">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 to prohibit the use of wild animals in circuses; and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">This Bill will amend the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 to introduce a new offence of using wild animals in a circus and also to create an offence of training wild animals for performing or exhibiting in a circus. Our position is for a complete ban of all animals in circuses, domesticated and non-domesticated. There are serious welfare issues with animals such as horses and dogs in travelling circuses. The Bill, however, would only cover wild animals. While I would support amendments to allow that ban to be extended, I am confident the Bill, in its current form, would ensure animal circuses are effectively ended.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> It is clear animals such as elephants, lions, zebras, tigers and camels cannot have their complex welfare needs met in a circus. Travelling circuses are stressful places which are completely inadequate and offer substandard conditions for animals. This is backed up by a wealth of evidence from veterinary experts and experts in animal welfare and behaviour around the globe. The evidence shows animals in circuses suffer from long-term psychological and physical problems as a result of being held in such conditions. They are often kept in caged wagons and small enclosures. They are regularly forced to perform unnatural and bizarre acts for them and are denied the space, climate and social interactions that wild animals need.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> Transportation of animals is a significant concern. In 2012, the Captive Animals Protection Society carried out a study of animal circuses in Ireland. It showed they tend to spend three days on a site and have next to no rest days. In 2012, Duffy’s circus had 500 performances over 266 days in all 32 counties. The shipping of animals around the country like this, with next to no breaks or rest, is clearly stressful and cruel.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> Across the globe, we have seen movements and then bans on the use of wild animals in circuses, pushed along by a progressive shift in attitudes and an active movement to protect and safeguard the welfare and rights of animals. In a 2014 poll, only 28% believed it was acceptable to use wild animals in circuses. Wild animal circuses are now banned in nine EU countries. In the UK, the House of Commons has supported a ban, which has been blocked, however, by a rump of Tory MPs. The devolved institutions in Wales and Scotland have also taken moves towards introducing a ban. In the North, there is a commitment to follow legislation here.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> The writing is on the wall for this outdated and cruel practice. Across Europe, animal circuses are becoming a thing of the past. As a result, Ireland is becoming a dumping ground. This Bill would stop this. Currently, over a dozen local authorities have banned animal circuses. While a positive move, it is not enough as it only applies to council-owned land. For example, in South Dublin County Council, there is such a ban, but the Belly Wien circus was able to operate on private lands.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> Regulations around animal circuses are completely absent. The previous Minister responsible, Deputy Simon Coveney, said he would prefer a code of practice under existing legislation. However, that is completely inadequate. It would not be an offence to breach a code of practice. One also has to look at the nature of the industry. It is highly mobile and, therefore, difficult to collect evidence of any offences and enforce any regulations. Many circuses are operated by thuggish elements. This was seen graphically with Circus Belly Wien last year when animal rights protesters and even gardaí were assaulted with iron bars. These people would not abide by a code of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Even if they did, regulations and codes of practice are not enough. The practice of having animals in circuses is in and of itself inherently cruel. I agree with groups, such as the ISPCA, Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which have said there needs to be a complete ban. I call on the Government and all political parties to express their support for banning wild animal circuses and to pledge to vote for this Bill on Second Stage. I call on people across the country to contact their Deputies to put pressure on them to support this Bill and to end wild animal circuses.</p>

          <p eId="para_403">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_404">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Education Act 1998 to make provision whereby the Minister for Education and Skills shall establish an Educational Disadvantage Committee to advise him or her on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The purpose of this Bill is to re-instate the Educational Disadvantage Committee under the Education Act 1998. This committee was in office from 2003-06 and its purpose was to advise the Minister for Education and Skills of the policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage. This committee was established on a statutory footing on a similar basis to the other bodies such as the National Council for Special Education and COGG, An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, with the functions of advising the Minister on policy initiatives for children with special educational needs and the provision of education through the medium of Irish respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> It is my understanding that the Educational Disadvantage Committee was quite effective in its work. It engaged significantly on the issue of educational disadvantage through the establishment of a forum on the issue, whereby stakeholders across the board came together and contributed significantly to the debate on educational disadvantage. The work of the committee fed directly into the establishment of the DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, scheme, which has had a huge impact in our schools in addressing educational disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Unfortunately, after the three year period for the membership of the committee, no new appointees were made by the then Minister. The committee was allowed to lapse and the legislative provision for the establishment of the committee was repealed in 2012. It is my view that the committee represented significant value for money, costing in total €175,000 over the three years it was in office and its abolition was a mistake. As we know, consistent child poverty rates have risen from 6.3% in 2008 to 11.5% in 2015, according to figures from the European Anti-Poverty Network. We also know that the overall funding for DEIS has fallen by almost €20 million from €193 million in 2008 to €174 million in 2015 at a time when child poverty rates were increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> Unfortunately, we are also aware that particular policy decisions have had a disproportionate effect on disadvantaged children and have increased educational disadvantage, for example cuts to guidance counselling provision, cuts to the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and cuts to educational services for Traveller children to name just a few. The fact that the Minister has identified at least 79 schools to be included in the DEIS scheme clearly shows that there is a significant level of educational disadvantage across our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> Every Member is aware of schools in their constituencies which have applied to join the scheme and have not been successful. This suggests that educational disadvantage is more prevalent than current policy provides for. Particular groups such as asylum seekers, children in lone parent households, Traveller children and, in recent years and to our great shame, homeless children are at particular risk of educational disadvantage. Little research or policy advice has been provided to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> The re-establishment of this committee on a statutory footing would be a timely initiative. It would send out a clear message that this House takes the issue of educational disadvantage seriously and is determined to address it. The Bill, itself short, provides for a new insertion of section 32 into the Education Act 1998. It outlines the function and powers of the committee and provides for other related matters.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_420">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_421">bearing in mind the specific matters considered by Government to be of significant public concern arising from the case of Grace (pseudonym), who resided in a former foster home in the South East which is the subject of abuse allegations, as detailed in the following reports:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_422">(<i>a</i>) Report of Conal Devine and Associates – Inquiry into Protected Disclosures, SU1 (2012);</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_423">(<i>b</i>) Report of Resilience Ireland Ltd. – Disability Foster Care Report HSE South East (2015); and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_424">(<i>c</i>) Report of Conor Dignam SC – Review of Certain Matters relating to a Disability Service in the South East (2016); </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_425">noting that the matter raises serious issues about the role of public authorities involved in the care and protection of Grace, and other persons who between 1989 and 2015 were in foster care or otherwise placed in the former foster home;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_426">noting that it is the opinion of the Government that a Commission of Investigation represents the best method of addressing the concerns raised;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_427">further noting that a draft Order which the Government proposes to make under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 (No. 23 of 2004) has been laid before Dáil Éireann on 8th March, 2017, in respect of the matters referred to, together with a statement of reasons for establishing a Commission under that Act;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_428">approves the draft Commission of Investigation (Certain matters relative to a disability service in the South East and related matters) Order 2017, and the statement of reasons for establishing a Commission of Investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this motion during the past three days. I acknowledge their constructive input into assisting the Government's consideration of these highly sensitive issues. This debate has demonstrated the complexity of the issues which we are asking the commission of investigation to examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> Despite our many differences in this Chamber, I am absolutely certain of one thing, and that is we all have one thing in common, which is the protection of Grace and all vulnerable people as citizens of this State. I appreciate the passion and feeling about Grace and others who have suffered so much in the care of the State when they most needed protection. I share it. We are all on the same side. We all share the same unity of purpose in protecting the vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> As I said in the House yesterday and reiterate now to eliminate any doubt, it is my intention, and it was always my intention, that there would be a second phase to this commission to investigate the care and decision-making in respect of all others who stayed in the foster home. Nobody was to be excluded but the initial focus of the commission was always going to be on Grace, given the length of time she spent in the foster home. I make no apologies for that. It has been said that a nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> I advise Members that it is our moral obligation to ensure safeguards are always in place to protect Grace and those like her who cannot speak for themselves, and when those safeguards fail, to find out why and to make sure it never happens again. As Members will be aware, the Resilience Ireland report which undertook a full tracing and look-back exercise on behalf of the HSE examined 46 other service users who were placed with and who were identified as having stayed with the foster family who are at the centre of this case, primarily in the period 1983 to 1995. The revised terms of reference of the commission of investigation will now ensure each and every one of those 46 cases will be looked into. It is only right that they have a voice also, and that was always my position.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> Members also referred to an individual who was in a private placement with the foster family and who continued to visit the family until 2015. The terms of reference have been clarified to show that this is taken into account in order that the full extent of this person’s contacts with the foster family can be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> I am aware that concerns have been expressed this morning at the Committee of Public Accounts specifically about the HSE’s previous appearances before the committee when matters relevant to this were discussed. I assure all members of the committee that the terms of reference as suggested by Conor Dignam take account of these concerns. This is a matter that emerged this morning. Part 9(b) of the terms of reference tasks the commission with establishing the facts regarding any deliberate suppression or attempted suppression of information during the period 1996 to 2016, with particular reference to the period July 2009 to March 2016. This will encompass the HSE’s various attendances at the Committee of Public Accounts and address any concerns which the members of the committee have in this regard. I also emphasise that if Deputies check the terms of reference, which were published by the Department of Health on Tuesday of this week, this provision was always included and was always intended to be addressed in the first phase of the commission’s work. Again, I emphasise the importance of these sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> It is no good being appalled at the headlines if we do not make significant changes when we see that a system is not working. We are the lawmakers and we can make those changes. It is time to move beyond being shocked and appalled at the uncovering of one scandal after another and realise we have the power to effect change to protect the vulnerable in order that health professions, the public and all citizens can have confidence that vulnerable people in care will be protected appropriately and better. I look forward to that day. I commend this motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_436">I am pleased to be back here again today to speak on the new revised terms of reference. I reiterate our support for the proposal to set up a commission of investigation into the events surrounding the Grace case. Yesterday I and Deputy John McGuinness attended a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, and new terms were agreed which addressed Deputy McGuinness's concerns. He felt the original terms did not go far enough and I am glad that he welcomes the new ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> The new terms of reference are now clear that for the avoidance of doubt - there was doubt on the part of some - there is a need to cover all those who were living in the home in question and not only Grace. In addition, the terms of reference now give clearer recognition to the need to include the whistleblowers who brought these allegations into the public domain. The chair of the commission of investigation has confirmed she is satisfied that the revised terms provide her with the flexibility to investigate this case satisfactorily. The amended terms of reference prevent any misinterpretation and now explicitly and clearly state that when the investigation into Grace is completed, the commission will set out what further action it will take on the other cases. This was always the intention of the commission of inquiry as it has to take into consideration all reports done previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> As I said on Tuesday night, it therefore seems unimaginable that in light of what we already know, there would not be further inquiries undertaken. While I do not believe the original terms would ultimately have excluded anything, and nothing was actually ruled out, the new terms provide some more definition, and that is welcome. As I said the other night, the details so far about other cases may not be on the same spectrum of horror as that of Grace but the concern about them is justified and legitimate. The amended terms of reference still put Grace's case front and centre and I believe there is an urgent need to complete the inquiry on Grace first.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> There is a real urgency about this matter now and I want to see the commission up and running straight away. I hope to see an interim report next September and I hope too we will be discussing its report on Grace this time next year. What is important now is that the Commission gets on with its work, does it as thoroughly and efficiently as possible and provides the answers that this House, the public, Grace, her mother and the others who lived in that the foster home deserve.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">We have had one false start in the matter of the commission of investigation into the care and protection of a named service user, Grace, a pseudonym, and the other 46 service users who were also placed in the same former foster home in the south east. That is, in my opinion, one false start too many.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> I have availed, as have others over the past 24 hours, of the opportunity to engage directly with the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy McGrath, regarding the voiced concerns of Members about the original establishing motion on the terms of reference for the commission. It is my view that the Minister of State and his staff have introduced greater clarity to the terms of reference regarding their intentions and the ask or brief that is now being made of or given to Ms Majorie Farrelly SC. I am in no in doubt as to the project now to be undertaken by Ms Farrelly but I am strongly of the view that there should be no further delay in the commencement of her work as sole member of this new commission of investigation. I am anxious the full facts are established as soon as possible and that a bright light is shone into all the dark places where Grace and the other mistreated and vulnerable young people were so cruelly let down and their safety betrayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">This must include not just the former foster home and the so-called providers who lived there, but also the local services, the South Eastern Health Board, the HSE, the Garda, the social workers, a Government Minister or Ministers, anyone who had a State-approved or agency responsibility and anyone else who could have known anything about the abominable treatment to which Grace and the other innocent victims were subjected and who, if they knew, ignored what was happening or represented a false picture of that house and its shameful story. I do not only expect their exposure; I expect that, arising from this process, action will be taken including, where appropriate, criminal prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> While this commission of investigation will focus on the specific placement of the 47 children in this former foster setting, I believe a wider investigation of the South Eastern Health Board and its successors in respect of their child care and child placement practices and policies should be undertaken. We should not be so naive as to believe that these disgraceful failures were confined to the south east. We need the truth across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Finally, as a brother of a non-verbal, intellectually-disabled man in a HSE care home placement, I also demand, on my brother's behalf and on behalf of all others so challenged in life, the necessary assurances and the guarantee that he and they are and will be cared for as we, their loved ones, would wish. While I have every confidence in Dermot's placement and care, every parent, every sibling, every loved one is entitled to that same confidence and certainty. On behalf of Sinn Féin, as spokesperson for disability rights, I put on the record my support for the proposition and its associated terms of reference.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">Táim buíoch as an deis labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. Cuirim fáilte roimh an athrú a rinne an tAire Stáit, Teachta McGrath, i ndiaidh na díospóireachta sa Teach agus an ráiteas a rinne sé inniu. I welcome the decision by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to take on board a number of concerns of Teachtaí about the terms of reference of the commission of investigation into the Grace case and foster services for citizens with disabilities in the south east. I know the Minister of State to be very well-intended, but it is a matter of concern that the welcome change to the terms of reference only came after some rí rá and ruaille buaille because we here have argued for years for terms of reference which, thankfully, are now reflected in the Minister of State's revised version.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> For 20 years, Grace endured abuse and neglect, and despite concerns being reported by whistleblowers, the HSE did not investigate allegations of abuse. This was not just a systems failure; it has all the elements of a criminal conspiracy. There is an urgent need to know who is responsible and find out who knew what was happening. There is an urgent need to investigate allegations of a cover-up and claims that files were deliberately destroyed. The most glaring question is why no one was disciplined, sacked or charged with a criminal offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Our main focus must be to protect these citizens. This is our main concern. I hope the commission of investigation will be able to get to the bottom of all these questions. For our part, the question for the Dáil is why we let Grace down - because we did - and why the Government did not act when these dreadful matters were raised here. I commend the whistleblowers and others who have advocated on behalf of Grace and the other citizens at the centre of these injustices.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_450">As I indicated on Tuesday evening, this has been an extraordinary uphill struggle, particularly for the two whistleblowers, who are articulate, able, committed women who saw a terrible wrong and were determined to have it fully ventilated and investigated. However, achieving a commission of investigation is not an end in itself. The terms of reference are critically important, as we have learned again and again. It was for this reason I was critical on Tuesday evening of a number of things, the first of which being the way the terms of reference were dealt with. They were not circulated with the motion by the Government on Tuesday. Party leaders were in here at 2 p.m. when the motion was circulated and we had one hour, until 3 p.m., to provide amendments. This is not the way a proposal for an important investigation should be brought before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> I had the opportunity, when I saw the original terms of reference, to take brief legal advice and it was quite clear to me that they were not comprehensive. The Government asked Conor Dignam to consider the two reports that were <i>in situ</i> at the time and set out proper terms of reference, which he did in very clear terms. It struck me as most odd that while most of his terms of reference were more or less cut and pasted from his report into the terms of reference before the House, the final four were not. I do not accept the view expressed already by others that these matters would inevitably have been investigated by this commission. The advice I received was that there was a definitive decision in the terms of reference to simply allow the commission to scope it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> The changes are very welcome and I commend the Minister of State on listening to and having regard for the very clear arguments that were made. In the original terms of reference circulated on Tuesday, Part I(c) stated "make recommendations as to what further work may be warranted". This has now changed to "set out for Government the further work the Commission will undertake". That is critically different. In Part II of the revised terms of reference the phrase "an interim report on the second phase (the matters set out in Part X)" is used. This relates to the issues that were excluded, in my judgment, from the oversight of the commission in the original terms of reference and these must now be reported upon within six months from the date of the commencement of the work on the second phase. I very much welcome that. It is truly important.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> The fundamental difference relates to Part X, which, in the original terms of reference set out for the House to agree, in essence only allowed for a scoping exercise and did not provide for the guarantee of a follow-though investigation. Both versions of the terms of reference refer to "[the] recommendations regarding the areas to be examined by a Commission of Investigation contained in Chapter 4 of that report". However, in the new, revised terms of reference, it is not a scoping exercise. They state quite clearly, "which the Commission will undertake" and even the word "intend", which I asked to be removed, is no longer present. I thank the Minister for doing so. The terms of reference no longer state "intend to undertake" but "will undertake", and this is now quite explicit in the revised terms of reference. The issues that were not captured, in my judgment, in the terms of reference before the House on Tuesday, namely, the care and decision-making in respect of others - that is, the other 46 people involved - now "will be" investigated by the commission. In addition, the actions of the HSE in its investigations, the protection of others and the protection of disclosures, including its treatment of whistleblowers, are now all explicitly captured in the terms of reference. These developments are most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> As I said, at the heart of these matters is an extraordinary failure - again and again - to have the welfare of a most vulnerable citizen of Ireland respected and protected. We need to know why - every step of the way - that was the case and who was responsible. I am now more confident than I was on Tuesday last that we will get speedily to the heart of these important questions.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_455">This has been a week of shock, shame and horror in view of the failure of this State to protect its most vulnerable citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I am in a state of almost complete disbelief when I try to understand what happened in the case of Grace and the 46 other children placed with this family and how over a sustained period allegations of abuse of Grace and others in the care of this family, and supposedly under the care of the State and the HSE, were not addressed and efforts to blow the whistle were suppressed, or not dealt with, even after the intervention by a Minister. I find it somewhat extraordinary that the Minister has said nothing even at this stage about what happened. When I hear Inclusion Ireland say this is not all in the past but that there are endemic systems failures in dealing with people with intellectual disabilities and non-verbal people and that the abuse of these people goes on every day even now across the State, I cannot say I am terribly confident that we are going to get to the bottom of it. I hope we are and others have followed this in more detail than I have. I do not doubt the Minister of State has listened to what has been said and is doing his best to come up with terms of reference for a commission that will try to get to the bottom of this but it would be difficult to be confident. One can only be hopeful that the commission will get to the bottom of this appalling, incredible and unbelievable set of circumstances. Even beyond that, it has to prompt change if it is being suggested by those who advocate on behalf of people with intellectual disabilities that this is going on, that it is endemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> I know people who come to my clinic and in my constituency whose hearts are broken by the treatment of their loved ones at the hands of services that should be protecting them. The Minister of State knows that I have raised the case of a couple with concerns about their non-verbal daughter's treatment at the hands of services that we fund although they are outsourced. That is part of the problem, the arm's length responsibility of the State which is outsourcing the protection of some of our most vulnerable people to other agencies and not resourcing or providing the trained experienced staff, the services and joined-up approach to protect and monitor our vulnerable citizens and ensuring the services provided for them are serving their needs, their interests and protecting them fully. I hope this can prompt some change. </p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Given the appalling circumstances of this case and the rather shambolic response we have seen over the past week, although this is an improvement, one would not be terribly confident. Let us hope this is a step on the road to getting the answers to this incredible, appalling set of circumstances but I think we have a long way to go to address the concerns of those who advocate on behalf of our vulnerable citizens and those with intellectual disabilities in respect of their treatment and the failure of the State to protect them.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">The manner in which this has been addressed has been utterly shambolic and wholly unacceptable. I really hope this does not come back to bite us. The reason it is particularly important we get things right in this case is that we know the backdrop is information that is at best economical with the truth and at worst deliberate misinformation in previous attempts to resolve these issues. Forgive us if we have trust issues where the HSE is concerned. We think they are legitimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Yesterday when we had a meeting with the Minister of State we wanted to raise the issue of the draft order, the statutory instrument upon which the terms of reference were based. The first response we heard was that nobody else raised that issue of wanting to address the terms of reference. We had to commission legal opinion from Eames Solicitors to explain why the order had to be changed and that the terms of reference could be <i>ultra vires</i> if the Minister of State did not do that. We went on to submit changes to the terms of reference, none of which was included. No doubt the Minister of State will argue that the order and the terms of reference, in the manner in which they have been changed, will allow us address all the issues we have raised. That is possibly the case. I seriously hope it is but I found it ironic this morning that one of the amendments we specifically proposed was on the problem highlighted by the Committee on Public Accounts, the fact that earlier attempts to get to the truth, including by Ministers and Oireachtas committees, were deliberately thwarted by persons or persons unknown within the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> It is a fact that information was put out that the Garda was blocking publication of the reports, not allowing even Ministers see them. We know now that is not true. I raised the case with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, of a vulnerable person who remained in that facility until 2015. He efficiently asked whether anybody was being sent to this. He was cleverly told that the HSE was not sending anybody. It said it might be a private placement but that it was sorted. It was not sorted. The HSE did not care about the truth or the person at the centre of the incident. It was all for covering up for the organisation. The Devine report has been widely discredited. The terms of reference for the Resilience Ireland report were drafted by Arthur Cox, the legal team that represented the HSE in the Grace case. One could not make this up. Heads have to roll over this. I really hope that the changes have got it right and that we will be proved wrong but there is a lot hanging on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">We welcome the changes. This has been an incredible debacle. As far back as 1990 this foster home was found to be not fit for purpose. There was a cover-up, the first one. In 1993, a mother made a complaint and was bullied into not following it up and was threatened with allegations being made against her own family. A formal investigation which took place was signed off by the senior social worker in Waterford: cover up No. 2. In 1996 another mother made a complaint. Some good people on the ground sought to have Grace removed and given a different placement, but a higher authority overruled. It was in too deep up now: cover up No. 3.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Over the next few years there were more attempts to find a different placement for Grace but it did not happen. The abuse was allowed to continue. The primary whistleblower is a man, which does not appear on the radar. He had worked in the region since 2000. He became the social worker for Grace in 2007. In early 2008 he concluded that Grace needed to be made a ward of court to ensure she was taken out of the placement. The HSE response was to pull down the shutters. It removed the files from his desk, ordered him off the case and told him he was not allowed to make any more contact with Grace's mother. This man is the main whistleblower of the three.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> The inquiry should examine the despicable way the family of the girl called Sara has been treated, how it was bullied into withdrawing their sex abuse allegations in 1993 and came under Garda suspicion in 2014 because they helped the primary whistleblower, who was Grace's social worker, as he was investigating the foster carer. The inquiry needs to find out who asked the Garda to look for files on Sara's family in 2014. Does the name Maurice McCabe ring a bell? In this case the local sergeant did the honourable thing in informing the family.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I sincerely hope this investigation gets to the bottom of the manner in which the HSE higher authority has behaved through all of this, with one cover-up after another. It is absolutely imperative for the primary whistleblower to be included in this whole process. The way he was treated by the HSE and the question of who was responsible for that treatment has to be investigated.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">When I spoke on this issue on Tuesday evening, I did not think I would be speaking on it again two days later. I welcome the Minister of State's decision to broaden the terms of reference. While Grace will of course have priority in the investigation, the terms of reference have been expanded to include the other 46 children who passed through the foster home and to examine the protected disclosures made by the whistleblowers in this case. Although the commission is absolutely essential, I suggest we need to move beyond this process by looking at the lack of governance, accountability and transparency that is underpinning this controversy. This problem must be addressed in the reform of our health service and our entire public service. There is a lack of governance. We must learn from this commission. We should put in place a proper governance structure underpinned by legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Why does the process of uncovering scandals like this depend on whistleblowing, which has almost become part of the institution rather than the exception? It is only through whistleblowers that we find out about wrongdoing and malpractice. In this case, there has been an abuse of trust, of power and of vulnerable people. Why does the first response of agencies like the HSE always involve covering up, denying wrongdoing and giving misinformation? This is allowed because there is no legislation underpinning governance, transparency and accountability in our health service. If we are to learn any lessons from this process, it is that we require strong legislation to ensure something like this can be identified very early and not allowed to develop. We cannot depend on whistleblowers to look after us.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">Like Deputy Harty, I did not expect to have to debate this matter again this week. I indicated on Tuesday evening that I was not happy with the terms and conditions of the commission. I was equally unhappy that there was absolutely no consultation. I thank the Minister of State for going back on his heels by withdrawing the motion last night and offering us time with his officials yesterday. I thank the officials for the briefing we were given. Why was the shambolic first set of rules, regulations and guidelines for the establishment of the commission proposed? Why were attempts made to make aspects of the Grace case commission <i>ultra vires</i>, or outside the scope of the Oireachtas and the courts? There is protection going on within the HSE. I suggest the Minister of State must have been misled by his own officials because he would have known better if he was not misled. Why were groups in this Chamber given just an hour to submit amendments? There is something rotten in the HSE. There is something rotten with public officials, as Deputy Harty has suggested. Why does the truth about the horrific Grace case and many other cases have to be dragged from them kicking and screaming? Why was it proposed to delay the investigation into the other unfortunate people in the same foster home?</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> As the Minister of State knows, all of us hear every day of the week about cases that are going on. The HSE is out of control. There was a furore at the Committee of Public Accounts this morning because a statement made by the head of the HSE to the committee last year, to the effect that certain people are no longer employed by the executive, has transpired not to be the case. Up to three of these people are still in the HSE. Who is hiding them? There should not be any hiding place or refuge for them. They have to be outed because the cover-up is disgusting in the extreme. When whistleblowers come out now, it seems to be the order of the day to try to demonise, disgrace and discredit them. I have heard from whistleblowers. We have whistleblowers coming out our ears now because our bureaucratic systems are unaccountable and Ministers are not in charge and are not doing their business. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is a new Minister of State and I wish him well. Ministers can be fobbed off by being told that certain things are not wanted by the Garda or other authorities. It is not acceptable that information has to be dragged from such authorities kicking and screaming.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> I understand the Committee of Public Accounts has demanded this morning that the HSE officials come back to the committee within a week by letter and within two weeks in person to explain this misleading information. More of them could be gone in the meantime with another big pay-out and with another private path charted for them within the loop so that they can set up private services. Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about services being farmed out to retired people who previously used to run such services inside the system. It is completely bizarre and outlandish. Legislation must be introduced to prevent public officials and people like me from going into consultancy businesses. I see such people walking around here every day. The former Minister, Mr. Dempsey, hid for five or six years but now he is back in here every day as a hired gun. He wants to meet our groups about this, that and the other. That should not be allowed. In the interests of decency, there should be some clear water between public officials and retired politicians. The same thing is happening with An Bord Pleanála. It stinks to high heaven. It is outrageous. I hope the commission will come up with results without being delayed or challenged in the courts so that the families of Grace and the other unfortunate individuals who were almost mortally wounded in unbelievable circumstances can get justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">I would like to repeat a point I made when we were setting up the McCabe commission two weeks ago because there is a pattern developing here. This House would not be discussing these issues or in the process of setting up these investigations if it were not for the work of brave whistleblowers and a small number of investigative journalists, most notably in the RTE investigations unit. There is no sense that anybody can be proud of anything here at all. The system did not expose this wrongdoing. There are major problems because of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The handling of this issue leaves a huge amount to be desired. On Tuesday, the Minister of State rushed to the media to get the terms of reference out with no regard for anybody else in this House. There was no consultation with anybody. The glaring omissions could have been addressed at the time if consultation had taken place at an earlier stage. We were given inaccurate information about the opportunities available to us to amend the terms of reference. There was a failure to answer pertinent questions. As a result of all of this, the terms of reference were withdrawn and needed to be revisited. The revised terms of reference were rushed this morning and people were not given adequate time to consider them. The Cregan inquiry is an example of what I am talking about. The rush to legislate resulted in mistakes being made. The Government had to return to the Dáil to correct those mistakes and widen the terms of reference of the inquiry. In my view, the Minister of State should not have engaged in such bad practice in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> There is no doubt that the most glaring omission from the version of the terms of reference we saw earlier in the week was the exclusion of the 47 children other than Grace. Those terms of reference quite clearly provided for a scoping exercise but not for an investigation. I am glad that omission has now been corrected. There is concern among many of the families that this will be a long and drawn-out process and that there will be further delays in getting answers for the other 47 families. I welcome the decision to proceed with this investigation in two phases, in line with a suggestion I had made. I want the Minister of State to assure the House that there will be no delay between the first and second phases. The terms of reference talk about having to come back to the Government after the first phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> I would like to refer to another matter that I raised in confidence with the Minister of State yesterday. It is an important matter concerning the commission. While I do not wish to raise it publicly, it is important for me to record my concern and to say I am seeking clarification on it. The Minister of State responded to me a short while ago in a letter in which he said he would provide clarification prior to the order establishing the commission being approved. I want him to clarify what exactly he means by that. What kind of timescale is envisaged for the procedural approval of the order? I will continue to wait for information on the potentially quite serious issue I raised with the Minister of State yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> The whole question of the three-year delay has not been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Much misleading information is being put out by various people on the role of the Garda in all of this and how it was there could have been a three-year delay. The other major issue relates to staffing and we have not had any explanations on that. We could get those answers now if the Minister of State took the trouble to ask the questions about the three staff who took the original decision not to move Grace, the five staff involved with the case who are currently working in the Health Service Executive and the six staff involved with the case currently working in Tusla. The Minister of State should provide those answers now.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Quite clearly there is very poor governance and accountability in how many of our health services are organised. If we are to have accountability, jobs must be on the line. There is a culture within our health service that people are untouchable because they cannot be sacked. That must change and when serious errors are made in terms of accountability and wrongdoing, a price must be paid. That means jobs should be on the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The Minister of State's words are fine when he speaks about moving beyond being shocked and appalled, having the power to effect change and looking forward to the day we can have confidence in our systems. I do not know what those words mean. How can he speak about that as if all the problems have been resolved? How can he speak about having confidence in the system when he knows perfectly well that the disability and social work services are seriously under-resourced? It is only meaningless rhetoric.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_44">The following motion was moved by Deputy Thomas Byrne on Wednesday, 8 March 2017.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_45">"That Dáil Éireann:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_46">recognises that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_47">— the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is drastically understaffed, with 95,543 primary and post-primary pupils across 397 schools without access to an assigned NEPS psychologist;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_48">— even for schools that do officially have an assigned NEPS psychologist, access to a psychological assessment for a developmental or behavioural issue is unacceptably long, creating adverse effects on children’s education and reducing access to resource teaching hours and learning supports, and privileging households that have the resources to opt for private assessment;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_49">— there are serious inequities and defects in the current allocation of resource teachers and learning support across schools; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">— there is a serious shortage of special Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classes at post-primary level, with less than half (45 per cent) the number of classes available at primary level; overall there are 548 ASD classes at primary and just 237 at post-primary, and there is also a severe shortage of ASD classes at pre-school level, with only 127 classes available throughout the country;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">acknowledges that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_52">— while the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has proposed a reformed system, whereby access to resource teaching would no longer rely upon a formal diagnosis of learning difficulty, emotional or behavioural problems, there are legitimate concerns over aspects of the proposed new allocation model for resource teaching and learning supports that need to be addressed;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_53">— the absence of special ASD classes in secondary schools is a national travesty and is creating real discrimination against children with ASD, and a much greater sense of urgency is required to ensure that these children can claim their entitlement to education by gaining admission to an appropriate school; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_54">— the outlawing of ‘soft barriers’ in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, to children with autism being admitted to school is insufficient to deal with the scale of the crisis; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_55">calls on the Government to:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_56">— give a firm commitment that no child with assessed special education needs will be deprived of resource teaching or learning supports under the new allocation model and that schools will have additional provisions made available for students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_57">— bestow the NCSE with statutory powers to direct schools at primary and post-primary level to establish autism units and/or special classes where these are required in an area; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">— act on the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the number of NEPS psychologists by at least 65 with the goal of reducing the ratio of students to each psychologist in real terms."</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_62">— the strong commitment of this Government and the last Government to the issues of student mental health and wellbeing, and special educational needs;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_63">— that the Government’s commitment to special educational needs is evidenced in particular by the increase of the overall budget for special educational needs supports from €1.28 billion in 2011 to more than €1.5 billion now, with special educational needs accounting for approximately one fifth of the overall education budget, and corresponding improved outcomes for students;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">— that the number of special classes has more than doubled, from 548 in 2011 to 1,153 across the country now, of which 889 are special Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classes; that the number of special classes at post-primary level has doubled in the past three years and continues to rise rapidly;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">— that the number of resource teachers has increased by more than 41%, from 5,265 in 2011 to over 7,500 now;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">— that, since 2011, the number of Special Needs Assistants has increased by more than 22%, from 10,575 to 13,115; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">— that, since the previous Fine Gael-led Government took office in 2011, and despite an adverse economic climate, sanctioned National Educational Psychology Service (NEPS) staffing numbers have been maintained at the same levels, and NEPS now provides a service to an additional 20,000 pupils compared to 2011;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">and calls on the Government to:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">— restate its strong commitment to both the areas of special educational needs and student mental health and wellbeing, and the range of ambitious measures underway in these areas through the Action Plan for Education;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">— give a firm commitment that no school and no student with special educational needs will lose resources as a result of moving to the new model of allocation of resource teaching, and above all that all students will see better outcomes as a result of its implementation;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">— carefully evaluate the case before considering any legislative change to compel schools to open ASD units or special classes against their will as there should be convincing evidence that the school system in an area is failing to make provision for ASD students before any such move should be considered and any possible unintended consequences should be carefully examined, including the question of whether parents and students would be satisfied to attend a school which had been compelled to provide these services against its will;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">— restate the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to deliver an additional 65 NEPS psychologists over the lifetime of this Government; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">— commits to the recruitment of a total of 21 educational psychologists by September 2017."</summary>

          <p eId="para_1014">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1015">To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1016">“recognises that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1017">— the National Educational Psychology Service (NEPS) is drastically understaffed, with 619 primary and post-primary schools across the State without access to a NEPS psychologist for the purposes of carrying out an assessment;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1018">— the restriction of two assessments per 100 pupils under the current scheme means that access to a psychological assessment for a developmental or behavioural issue is unacceptably constrained, creating adverse effects on children’s education and reducing access to resource teaching hours and learning supports, and privileging households that have the resources to opt for private assessment;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1019">— the insufficient resourcing of early intervention and school age teams for mental health and disability, means that the complex special education needs of a child are not always identified or assessed prior to enrolment at school;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1020">— there are serious inequities and defects in the current allocation of resource teachers and learning supports across schools;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1021">— the reduction of resource teaching hours to 85% of that recommended by the Special Education Review Committee was a cruel cut to vulnerable children; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1022">— there is a serious shortage of special autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classes at post-primary level, with less than half (45%) of the number of classes available at primary level; overall there are 548 classes at primary level and just 237 at postprimary, and there is also a severe shortage of ASD classes at pre-school level, with only 127 classes available throughout the State;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1023">acknowledges that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1024">— while the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has proposed a reformed system, whereby access to resource teaching would no longer rely upon a formal diagnosis of learning difficulty, emotional or behavioural problems, there are legitimate concerns over aspects of the proposed new allocation model for resource teaching and learning supports that need to be addressed;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1025">— the absence of special ASD classes in secondary schools is a travesty and is creating a real discrimination against children with ASD, and a much greater sense of urgency is required to ensure that these children can claim their entitlement to education by gaining admission to an appropriate school; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1026">— the outlawing of ‘soft barriers’ in the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2016, to children with autism being admitted to school is insufficient to deal with the scale of the crisis; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1027">calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1028">— immediately restore the 15% cut in resource teaching hours and publish information on the criteria used to establish the resource allocation to schools, under the new resource allocation model, particularly in respect of the future complex needs model;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1029">— give a firm commitment that no child with special educational needs will have their resource teaching hours or learning supports reduced under the new allocation model;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1030">— ensure that an appropriate and robust appeals mechanism will be in place, as recommended by Inclusion Ireland, the NCSE and the inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills, to address unanticipated changes in a school’s profile under the new resource allocation model, including instances where children start school from September 2017 or transfer from another school with special educational needs;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1031">— immediately commit to the provision of sufficient resources for early intervention and school age teams for mental health and disability, including immediate funding for the recruitment of staff to fill all current vacancies;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1032">— bestow the NCSE with statutory powers to direct schools at primary and post-primary level to establish autism units and-or special classes where these are required in an area; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1033">— act on the commitment in A Programme for Partnership Government to increase the capacity of the NEPS service, by the recruitment within a two-year timeframe of at least 100 additional NEPS psychologists with the goal of reducing the ratio of students to psychologists in real terms and ensuring that children have access to a timely assessment as envisaged by the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.”</p>

          <p eId="para_1299">I welcome this progressive Bill. Anything that prevents deaths and promotes harm reduction in this city is very good. Supervised injecting rooms give people access to treatment, take people off the streets and give them alternative means of gaining access to the drug they take. In addition, they reduce the number of overdoses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300"> I have seen the social damage that heroin has done to the community I lived in. I saw friends of mine die from heroin abuse. I saw at first hand the absolute tragedy of what heroin does to communities. The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will appreciate that herself. In the area she represents, she will have seen the absolutely appalling damage drugs have done to people. Nobody on this earth grows up wanting to be a heroin addict. It is not of their choosing; it is because of circumstances. We all make mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes are fatal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301"> It is very good that we are having a debate in this country on the decriminalisation and liberalisation of drug use. We are getting there. It is very important to have the discussion. A number of Deputies will agree that this issue is more about treating people holistically and according to a health-based approach rather than treating them as criminals. Would we lock up a chronic alcoholic in a prison? We would not. We would give him or her treatment and try to give him or her a plan to move beyond the circle of chronic abuse. I hope a day will come when a chronic abuser of heroin or another drug will be able to bypass the criminal justice system and be treated according to an holistic, health-based approach. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302"> References to the Portuguese model are bandied about a lot. This is important because if we can save one life, it will have been well worth the effort. I was in Portugal last year and asked many people about how the system works for people there. If a person is caught in possession of a certain amount of drugs there, he or she is not criminalised but given an alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303"> The war on drugs has been an abject failure. We must consider completely different approaches. Some of these will be extremely hard for people to understand and some of them will be very radical. I believe those in possession of a small amount of drugs for their own use should not be criminalised. Rather, they should be offered another path. People injecting heroin in this city and others should be given an alternative. Under the supervision of doctors, they can stay away from the street environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304"> I welcome this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">There were 687 rehabilitation beds and 144 detox beds in Ireland, but over the past eight or nine years, those numbers were vastly reduced because of austerity. Everyone knows that people who are coming off heroin or any other drugs must go through detox. Otherwise, they will go through a full circle of misery. I have friends who have gone through both systems. Some of them have come out the other end but for others it is a constant battle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306"> Nobody was born to take the worst drug of all, heroin, with the misery and social damage that it causes. Nobody chooses that path. People just take the wrong path in life. This legislation is progressive. It will give people an alternative and it is to be hoped we will see it being implemented in the next six months or so. If it can save one life, then it is well worth it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1309">Whenever I speak about drugs and addiction in this House I am reminded of my predecessor, the late former Deputy Tony Gregory who, from the time he came into the Dáil in 1982, was a lone voice for many years on drugs and addiction. At that time, officialdom was unaware, ignorant and indifferent to what was happening in our constituency. He used every opportunity to try to ensure these issues would not be forgotten. He highlighted the direct link between disadvantage and hard drug use. At that time, heroin was ravaging Dublin's inner city families, individuals and communities. The response had to be policy driven and it required an inter-agency approach involving the community and voluntary sectors and a co-ordination of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310"> His pioneering work eventually led to the establishment of the drugs task forces, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and the national drugs strategy. We all know the pillars of that strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311"> My own involvement in this area included chairing the north inner city drugs task force and, before that, the young people's facilities and services fund. In that context, I wish to refer to prevention and education because if we could get that right, we would really see a reduction in the numbers who get into addiction. I hope the new strategy will be stronger in that area than previous strategies. I know, from my own work, of many excellent education programmes which develop young people's critical thinking, teach them how to cope with peer pressure and to be assertive and confident in their ability to make decisions about taking drugs or alcohol. We have been doing work in the north inner city on these areas. I have learned about numerous very progressive programmes that are being run by community and youth leaders, as well as local councillors, in different parts of Dublin. Such programmes represent direct, meaningful and appropriate engagement with young people and they are working. We all know of wonderful young people with massive potential who have lost their way through addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312"> There are great examples in my constituency of treatment and rehabilitation services that are making a huge difference. Some of these services grew out of initiatives in the community because it was the community that was dealing with the effects of addiction and which saw the need for these services. I must acknowledge all the treatment and rehabilitation services for those in addiction, including the 12 step programmes, the methadone clinics, the harm reduction programmes and the counselling services that are being provided by accredited counsellors. Indeed, I wish to stress the importance of the accreditation of counsellors. There are programmes available that are specific to young people, women and to mothers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313"> Everyone knows that the road out of addiction into recovery is very difficult, and for many in addiction it involves relapses and hospitalisation. We are all aware of the numbers of people who have lost their lives to addiction. I am very familiar with the Ana Liffey Drug Project. It was set up many years ago by Mara de Lacy and Frank Brady at a time when there were very few services available and very few people reaching out to those in addiction. The project has developed considerably since then in response to emerging needs and it has done much work on proposals for supervised injecting rooms. When those running the Ana Liffey Drug Project realised that drug users were not presenting for services, it increased its use of outreach workers who would go out to those in addiction, bringing them harm reduction and health related material, including freefone numbers and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314"> The Minister of State has met representatives of the Union for Improved Services Communication and Education, UISCE. UISCE is a service users forum which is rolling out very innovative, peer-led programmes involving users.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315"> Two years ago, staff of the Ana Liffey Drug Project asked me to host an event in the audiovisual room in Leinster House. It was a presentation of the project's position on the concept of medically supervised injecting centres. They showed a film of an injecting room in Australia. To be honest, it was very difficult to watch people injecting themselves. It was obvious from the film that a very particular client group was using the injecting room. They were long-term users of heroin who, for various reasons, had not stopped taking heroin. The heroin addicts in the film were older, articulate and their drug use was such that they were able to wait to get to the rooms before injecting. However, the lives of some of our injecting heroin users are so chaotic, probably due to polydrug use with alcohol, that I would be concerned about their ability to wait to get to injecting room to use the facilities. That said, the project and outreach workers will know the client base who can avail of the rooms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316"> It was obvious from the film that staff were highly trained. It was also obvious that a number of other services were being offered in the injecting room and that is something we must get right here. I have spoken to people who have either visited or worked in injecting rooms and I know that the Minister of State visited one such facility in Copenhagen. I was told that because other services were available, the addict was in a space where he or she could be engaged with and that some were able to address their drug use. Counsellors saw a reduction in usage, with some clients being supported into recovery. Indeed, we should never lose sight of recovery, and supports must be available to encourage people into recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317"> In that context, I want to mention Recovery Academy Ireland, which grew out of research conducted by the Soilse drug rehabilitation project. Soilse and other projects have been supporting the recovery journey because apart from the obvious benefits to the life of the person in addiction, there is also a payback for communities and an economic payback in terms of our health services. Former addicts are providing a payback themselves by becoming recovery coaches, enabling, facilitating and supporting others into recovery. There are really good examples of recovery academies in England and Scotland which have set up recovery cafés and recovery business centres. The latter are aimed at people who were in addiction and are now in recovery but who cannot get bank loans to set up in business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318"> We all know that detox programmes are vital for many taking the first step into recovery. We also know of the value of methadone which gives people stability in their lives, but it is not a long-term solution except in a limited number of cases. There must be an exit strategy built into methadone programmes. I would stress that injecting rooms are but one part of a much bigger picture. As we know, addiction services were very badly hit by successive recessionary budgets. I support the provision in this legislation as a harm reduction measure for chronic drug users. It will provide a controlled space for them to inject, but again this is just one programme. We must not lose sight of the other programmes and strategies that form part of the national drugs strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319"> Addicts will have access to clean, sterile injecting equipment in the injecting rooms. Trained staff will be there to supervise the injecting and to act in the event of difficulties arising, including the possibility of people overdosing. I have one question regarding the Title, which is the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill. What exact level of medical supervision will be available?</p>
          <p eId="para_1320"> Why would anybody want to support supervised injecting rooms? The hope is that they will result in fewer deaths from heroin use and overdose. The alternative is to turn a blind eye to public injecting. In the north inner city one will see so many addicts injecting in laneways, side streets, main streets and doorways as well as on the DART and the Luas. That is the reality. Injecting rooms have been operating in Europe for 30 years, with the first one opening in 1986. Evidence from the approximately 90 drug consumption rooms around the world shows their effectiveness in reducing fatal overdoses, decreasing the incidence of public injecting and reducing drug related litter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321"> There are diverging opinions in Ireland on injecting rooms and all sides can present facts to support their arguments. I am not so naive as to think that this will be plain sailing. We cannot expect injecting rooms to prevent drug use, to divert all drug users from risky behaviour or to solve the wider issues of drug dealing. However, there is no evidence that the rooms recruit drug users into injecting. Rather, they are there for those who have been injecting long-term. This cohort of drug users needs encouragement, support and treatment towards recovery, but while they are injecting, they are deserving of our compassion and are deserving of dignity in their consumption and the rooms will give them that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">I know the relief it will give their loved ones because they are constantly waiting for the knock on the door to say that the addict has been found in a laneway or a doorway with needles all around them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323"> For the consumption rooms to have a chance of working, location is important. They have to be easily accessible and the opening hours have to be flexible. I know the concerns in Dublin regarding location. However, addiction services and consumption rooms in other cities do not attract the same attention as they do in Dublin. It is vital that there is engagement with the residents and with the Garda. It comes down to management and staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324"> There are two ironies. First, how cool and trendy it is for a certain cohort of drug users to do their lines of cocaine in the nightclub or in the hotel and yet at the same time, people who are injecting are looked down on. However, the same drug dealer is providing the drugs for both cohorts. Another irony is that we do not want them located near schools but in Dublin's north inner city schoolchildren going to school every day are watching people injecting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325"> I wish to make a point about the licenceholder's and his or her responsibility. There is another concern about section 19(1)(<i>e</i>) of the 1977 Act. There is a need to amend the provision regarding immediate personal consumption to be limited to small amounts of the drugs. We need to keep this under review as we go along. There also is an insurance element. Those places in Dublin involved in the needle exchange programme are experiencing huge increases in insurance premiums. Insurance premiums have gone from €2,000 in 2016 to nearly €15,000 in some areas now.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1326">I support the legislation on supervised injecting facilities introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne. There has been a demand from the Ana Liffey drugs project and other groups and the drugs task forces, including the one in which I am involved, the canal communities drugs and alcohol task force. They feel it is part of an overall intervention for people who use drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327"> There have been many representations from members of the public in my area, not in any way hostile to the people using heroin, but mainly because in areas such as at the back of the Viking centre, Dublinia, and the green section beside the flats and the school, there is open heroin injection. People are so desperate they literally just drop their trousers and inject themselves. Then the needles are left around the area. There has been huge concern about this for some time. A security officer in the Dublin civic offices who lives in my area has told me about tragic cases of trying to care for people who have overdosed and ambulances having to be called.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328"> This is a pilot scheme. It is certainly worth introducing the legislation and setting up the facility to see how it operates. How will the Garda deal with the issue of carrying drugs to the centre? I expect it will need to establish some sort of policy with the Department of Health and the facility as to how to deal with that. Drug pushers could try to target the area but I think that can be dealt with and obviously that will need to be continually reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329"> For those who want to inject heroin in a safe confined area, this is worthwhile legislation. We have a big problem with public injection. A recently published report by the UCD school of medicine on urban overdose hotspots found that over a 12-month period, ambulance services attended 469 overdoses in Dublin. The vast majority were concentrated in the city centre and 45% occurred on the street. Just under 90% were taken to hospital and 30 people who overdosed did not make it that far. There is a real need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330"> I have read articles by journalists who have spoken to heroin users in the centre. Some of them did not know what a medical centre would be - they had not heard about it, while others had. It can play a role as part of an overall strategy that I hope will be supported as regards the national drugs strategy in co-operation with the communities and the task forces. It has been successful in other parts of Europe and elsewhere. I read an article that indicated that in Australia in certain areas they brought in sniffer dogs to try to deal with some issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331"> We have to give it a chance to see how it develops. If it is successful, it is to be hoed that those heroin users will come into the centre and will make contact with other services in the area. I have contact with people involved in a hospital in Ballyfermot where there was a rehabilitation centre. It was closed down and moved to the Simon Communities on the quays. It plays a role in assisting people getting some stability back in their lives. Along with that has to be the long-term hope and vision those people have for themselves of getting a job and becoming responsible in their own right for their own future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332"> I give the Minister of State my full endorsement for the legislation and will be voting for it. It will be well supported by the drugs task forces.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineByrne" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1336">This is a long-awaited and important Bill. I feel I am in a relay race as part of a relay team. Previous Ministers of State before me have all passed on the baton of the supervised injection facility. I acknowledge the work done by those previous Ministers of State. I also acknowledge the work of the Ana Liffey drugs project through Tony Duffin, who was the first person to mention the words "injection facility" in 2012. I acknowledge that people who have gone before me have done huge work leading to this point this afternoon. As the baton has been passed on, I will probably be the lucky one to bring it across the finishing line.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337"> A number of words have popped out during the debate in the past few days - life saving; compassion; harm reduction; trust; and human beings. All of those words emphasise what the supervised injection centre should be all about. It should be about compassion, saving people's lives, harm reduction and most of all about treating people with respect as human beings and not just as people who for whatever reason end up in addiction and find themselves in such a chronic place that they are willing to inject on any street corner, beside a school, in a park or anywhere else. As public representatives, we have an obligation to facilitate the passage of the Bill as smoothly as we can. Hopefully before the year is out we can have the first supervised injection facility in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338"> Deputy Joan Collins spoke about the knowledge she has gained from working with the Canal Communities local drug task force. As we share the same constituency, we have both dealt with the same people. The Bill, as it stands, makes it clear that, like in other countries, An Garda Síochána will support supervised injecting facilities. Many gardaí, particularly those who work in Dublin's inner city and around the Merchants Quay and Ana Liffey drug projects, will know the people going into these centres. They take a pragmatic approach to how they deal with these addicts, which I hope will continue in the context of the supervised injecting centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339"> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is the only Member who spoke about compassion. This is the most important word that can be used. It can be used lightly sometimes but if it is used with a sense of meaning or purpose, it can make all the difference to people's lives. I first came into the House when the late Tony Gregory was a Member. He represented Summerhill, an area from where my family came and I knew of his work for a long time before I ever went into politics. He was the first person ever in Ireland to raise the problems of drug addiction. He was always ahead of the posse in that regard. Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan knows as well as I do about the history of drug addiction, particularly in Dublin's inner city and poorer areas. It affected people, for whatever reason, who did not get the opportunities in life that other people did, instead finding themselves trapped in addiction and criminal activity. Unfortunately, now more young people are targeted. This is why it is important that we work in these communities to inspire and encourage young people that there is something else in life besides getting involved in crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340"> Deputy Gino Kenny spoke about his knowledge of working in his area. I thank him for his support for the Bill. I thank all Deputies for their encouraging and supportive words in respect of this Bill. I note the positive comments of Deputies Jack Chambers and Jonathan O'Brien. They referred to the risks posed by street injecting and the problem of drug abuse. They also addressed the negativity and misconceptions which surround this issue. As I mentioned in my opening statement, and as was echoed by my colleagues, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, and Deputies O'Connell, Harty and Billy Kelleher, there is international evidence to prove that these centres do not promote drug use, do not cause an increase in drug-related crime and do not draw drug users into an area. However, they do reduce public injecting and drug-related litter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341"> These centres are an attempt to address problems which already exist in local areas, regardless of whether people choose to recognise that there are such problems. The number of people using a centre will be related to the number of individuals already injecting in public spaces in an area. However, I also understand some of the concerns a number of Members, including Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, raised. International evidence shows that these centres reduce pressure on policing in areas. The legislation does not affect planning permission. International evidence proves there is no honeypot effect in that people are drawn into an area just to inject. The injecting centres will aid the distribution of naloxone, which is a life-saving intervention used for dealing with overdoses. If a person overdoses in a laneway or a park, the chances are he or she may lose his or her life. A supervised injecting centre will allow the distribution of naloxone to prevent such deaths. There have been no deaths from overdoses in any of these centres across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342"> When I visited an injecting facility in Copenhagen before Christmas, I came out of it with a heavy heart because I was saddened by what I saw. As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, it is very difficult to watch people injecting themselves. However, this is reality, not a film or a dream. These are real people who, for whatever reason, find themselves consumed by addiction. They are the people we have to look after. They can no longer be statistics in newspaper reports about how someone else has passed away from an overdose. When I left the centre, I said to one of my colleagues from the Department that I would rather one of my children dying of an illness rather than being addicted to heroin or any other drug. While I know it is a terrible thing to say, that is the reality of this cruel life of addiction. I have met many people in my community whose children and grandchildren have lost their lives to drug addiction and I know of grandparents and other family members who have been left to rear very young children. The funeral of someone who has died from an overdose is disturbing for all involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343"> I met service users at the Copenhagen centre before Christmas who had been using drugs on the streets for decades. It was very sad to see, but the message from those people was clear to me, namely, that the centre is saving their lives. It is their lifeline and it provides a sanctuary for them when they have nothing else. The police in the city noted how the centres have actually freed up police and ambulance resources. There are statistics which show that overdose call-outs for ambulances have been reduced by up to 80% of because of these centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344"> An injecting centre does not prevent people from choosing to stop taking drugs. Neither does it stop them from engaging with treatment. It provides a chance for people to build up a level of trust with the staff working there. When they are ready, they can then access health and other services and eventually treatment. It offers another chance for these drug users.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345"> This Bill does not provide the location for an injecting centre. However, it is planned that the first centre will be a pilot service. This will be located in Dublin city centre where we know there is a problem with public injecting and the harm it causes to people. However, this pilot cannot be set up as the law currently stands. That is why we need this legislation. I have asked the Health Service Executive, HSE, to set up a working group that will identify the practical issues relating to setting up a pilot service. It includes representatives from the Garda Síochána, the Department of Health, the HSE, Dublin City Council and the service users group, Union for Improved Services Communication and Education, UISCE. The working group will report back to the HSE with recommendations on programme design, consultation, governance structures and the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the pilot service. The HSE will be undertaking a process of consultation, including with local stakeholders and communities. In other countries, there were apprehensions in the communities where these centres were located at the beginning. If such centres are run well and properly, there is nothing for the wider community to fear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346"> Any decision on the exact location will be informed by the outcome of this process. In line with the experience in other countries, it is expected that the location will be carefully selected to address the requirements and concerns of service users and the wider community. This pilot service will be evaluated to determine the safety, cost-effectiveness and the benefit of an injecting centre. The results of this pilot project will inform any decisions about future injecting centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347"> I agree with suggestions that practical policing is required. The Garda has acknowledged that it has a responsibility to play an appropriate role in ensuring that any injecting centres operate as intended and that the harm-reduction objectives are achieved. The Garda is engaged with, and will continue to be involved with, all steps in the process relating to the opening and running of injecting centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348"> I heard a radio interview by chance the other day involving a young garda on the beat being interviewed by a reporter. The garda had come upon a person who was injecting openly in a laneway. I was struck by what the garda said afterwards. He had to arrest the person and he said that, please God, when the injecting facility opens, it may help people like that poor lad who was injecting in the laneway. He said he had no option at the time but to take him in. The success of any injecting centre will be dependent on the engagement and co-operation of the Garda, health care professionals, local stakeholders and the wider community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349"> To address a matter raised by Deputy Harty about naloxone, a drug used in saving people in the event of an overdose, the HSE ran a very successful naloxone demonstration project in 2015. It helped to prevent five potentially fatal overdoses. Injecting centres will further help to get naloxone to those who need it to prevent further deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350"> The aims of any injecting centre in Ireland will be to reduce the amount of public injecting; to reduce drug related litter and the public health risks that it poses to the wider community; to reduce the number of drug related deaths resulting directly from an overdose on our streets; to enhance the dignity, health and well-being of people who inject drugs and provide them an opportunity to access health and other services; and to enhance the public amenity for the wider community where public injecting currently happens. The evidence is there. It is very strong. The alternative is to continue as we are and that is not working. People are dying on our streets. This Bill is not the solution to our drugs problem but it is a start to help those who are worst affected by drugs and drug addiction. There is a lot of hard work still to be done, but I am encouraged by the support, goodwill and positive comments of so many Deputies from across the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351"> I again thank all those who contributed and participated in the debate. I hope the Bill will have a smooth passage to Committee Stage and that it will progress as soon as possible. I emphasise the input of members of all parties and those who are not members of parties in bringing this Bill to the House. I also acknowledge the input of successive Ministers who passed the baton to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352"> If the Acting Chairman will indulge me, I would like to read from a poem as it is relevant to this debate. It is a small poem I came across a few years ago. I will read two verses of it as it sums up the people with whom we are dealing in this legislation. I know that the Chair would not normally allow a Member to read from a book but I ask for the Acting Chairman's indulgence in this instance. It is a simple poem about an addict:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1353">In the beginning</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1354">I was drawn to the sweet perfume </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1355">Of distant desires </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1356">Now I know its fire </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1357">Burning deep inside</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1358">The unquenchable thirst</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1359">The brutal hurt.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1360">I know the lonely heart </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1361">Not my own</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1362">But of those who stand watching </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1363">From separate shores,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1364">Who wanted more </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1365">For me and now</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1366">I've gone too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">Those verses are basically saying that these people know in their own minds that life has been a turmoil for them and an ultimate goal for them to reach is to be drug free and to begin life anew on a new journey. Another verse of the poem states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1368">Once filled by painful pride</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1369">May You now hide</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1370">Restoring hope</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1371">Opening doors </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1372">To life anew</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">The words "Opening doors" in second last line of that verse signify what we are doing here. I thank all the Deputies in the Chamber and my own party colleagues, and also the Ceann Comhairle and the Acting Chairman for allowing me the time to say those few words.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374"> I had better not sit down without thanking the officials who basically are the brains behind this legislation. The work tirelessly in their office in the Department and they have been truly amazing in recent months in putting the Bill together. I want particularly to thank Eugene and Eamon.</p>

            <p eId="para_1379">I remind the House that I and my Department have been actively engaged in assessing the impact of the Brexit vote on the Irish agrifood sector, consulting appropriate stakeholders and engaging the relevant politicians and institutions. This work is being done in conjunction with the overall Government response being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380"> I fully recognise the potential difficulties the agrifood sector could face in the event of a hard Brexit. The sector is of critical importance to our economy and its regional spread means it underpins the socioeconomic development in rural areas in particular. The sector employed approximately 173,000 people, that is, 8.6% of total employment in 2016, and the total value of agrifood exports was more than €11 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381"> The highly integrated nature of the agrifood trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom is shown in Central Statistics Office, CSO trade figures, with some €4.8 billion or 39% of exports to the UK last year, and €3.7 billion or 46% of agrifood products imported from the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382"> A number of credible analyses have been conducted on the potential impact on Ireland of a UK exit from the European Union, and all of these show that the result will most likely be unambiguously bad for the Irish agrifood sector. The more immediate impacts relate to the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro and the effects this is having on industries with significant trading activity in the United Kingdom, especially the mushroom and forest products sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383"> The medium to longer-term impacts will revolve around the potential application of tariffs, the implications of divergence in regulations and standards, border controls with the Great Britain and Northern Ireland and certification, including the related areas of veterinary and animal health certification. There will also be difficult challenges in potential restricted access to fishing grounds and resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384"> In response to the challenges being posed by Brexit, I have undertaken a number of important steps within my Department, which include the establishment of a Brexit response committee and a dedicated Brexit unit. I have also created a stakeholder consultative committee, which is complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis. In addition, I hosted two all-island civic dialogues for the agrifood sector, to which interested stakeholders from both sides of the Border were invited. The first of these, focusing on the dairy, cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry sectors, took place on 15 December 2016. The second, dealing with the prepared consumer foods, horticulture, forestry and cereals-animal feed sectors, took place on 8 February 2017. A civic dialogue for the seafood sector was held on 1 February 2017. All of these opportunities for consultation allowed me and my Department establish the issues of critical concern to industry stakeholders. I am also in regular communication with Commissioner Hogan and my officials have taken part in meetings with the European Commission and the Barnier task force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385"> At EU level, I have had regular contact with the Commission and with counterparts in the UK and other member states, including meetings with my Spanish and Maltese colleagues on the margins of last Monday’s Council of Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1387"> Arrangements are currently being made for further formal bilateral meetings over the coming weeks, involving Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark over St Patrick’s weekend and Poland, Austria and Estonia at the end of the month. In all of these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388"> On fisheries, Ireland wants to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect our quota share for joint fish stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389"> Last October, as part of budget 2017, I announced measures aimed at alleviating the pressures of income volatility and the potential impact of Brexit. These measures included the introduction of the agri cashflow support loan fund of €150 million, enhanced taxation measures and an additional allocation of €1.6 million in 2016 and €2 million in 2017 to Bord Bia to ensure it is in a position to provide Brexit related supports to affected companies. I also provided for increased funding under the rural development programme and seafood development programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390"> I recently awarded in excess of €1.8 million in grants to 19 seafood enterprises under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme for the seafood sector. The aim of these grants is to incentivise seafood innovation and new product development as a means of meeting the Brexit challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391"> The UK’s decision to leave the EU reinforces the need to develop as many outlets for our agrifood exports as possible to minimise our dependence on any one market. This principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise 2025. We have been very active in recent years in our efforts to diversify markets and to respond to consumer demands in emerging markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1392"> Inward and outward trade visits will play a key role in our efforts to provide as many markets as possible for Irish agrifood products. Last September, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and I led very successful trade missions to China, Singapore, Vietnam and South Korea and to north Africa in November. I have just returned from leading a trade mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which was very successful and I am currently considering potential further destinations for later in 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393"> I assure the House that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agrifood industry through the challenges ahead. I will continue to consult the industry as the negotiations develop and press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p>

            <p eId="para_1394">I thank the Minister for his response. He has clearly outlined the importance of Brexit for the Irish agrifood sector and the fishing industry. I do not need to reiterate that the agrifood sector is the largest indigenous employer as we face the threat that Brexit poses, in particular to our beef industry, with more than half of beef exports, one third of our dairy exports and exports from other sectors going to the UK. It is important that the Minister and Government are taking every effort and action to prepare for the upcoming negotiations and for Brexit, but unfortunately the Minister's actions in this respect and his preparedness in regard to the Government's activities are not what they need to be.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">Fianna Fáil has been watching very closely, and its spokespersons have been monitoring very closely, what the Government has been doing. For example, I have received responses to parliamentary questions showing that Bord Bia, which will play a critical role in identifying new markets, will only get four additional staff next year. The Minister's Brexit unit within the Department has only three staff and the consultative forum he set up has only met twice since it was established in July last year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1402">Brexit is the challenge of our time and, to be honest, that kind of shrill analysis does no justice to the scale of the challenge we face. I have operated an open door in the context of Brexit and the Deputy has not walked through it with any proposals or submissions on the issue of Brexit. His party spoke at length about the requirement for a Brexit Minister, but it was not until the party entered into the transfer market in early 2017 that it actually got around to appointing a specific spokesperson on Brexit and, to be honest with Deputy McConalogue, we have been particularly underwhelmed by any utterances from that spokesperson, Deputy McConalogue or Fianna Fáil on the matter generally. I extend again an invitation for any submissions or proposals - concrete suggestions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403"> Regarding the Deputy's critique of Bord Bia, the agency got sanction for 20 staff in 2016, four of whom remain to be appointed. Its resources were increased in the latter half of 2016, in an immediate response to Brexit, by €1.6 million. It received an additional €2 million this year. We do not have endless resources. We need to be extremely clever in using resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_1421">There is an adage that attack is the best form of defence. People often revert to this strategy when they have difficult positions to defend. The Minister is seeking positive suggestions. I have pointed out some very serious ones he should adapt, among them proper resourcing of his Department and the agencies that have a key role to play in this regard. He did not address my point about the fact that his Brexit unit only has three staff. There are many reasonable, good-sized farms in this country that have three people working full-time on them. I know many others in the Department will be and are already engaged in this task but only three dedicated people are attached to the Brexit unit the Minister himself set up. Similar British units have hundreds of staff working specifically on this issue. It is symptomatic as well that there is no Brexit Minister to engage with countries on behalf of the Government every single day that is available. For example, last week, the Minister was on an important one-week trade mission to Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries. While he is engaged in other activities and other Ministers are engaged in their day-to-day business, there is no specific person-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1459">Under the rural development regulation, each member state must designate areas eligible for payments under the areas of natural constraint scheme. The ANC scheme replaces the previous disadvantaged areas and less favoured areas schemes. The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date has been based on a range of socio-economic factors. From 2018, eligible areas must instead be designated using a set list of biophysical criteria. In cases in which a member state does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must be phased out on a digressive basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460"> The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are: low temperature; dryness; excess soil moisture; limited soil drainage; unfavourable texture and stoniness - I recall, as I am sure does the Deputy, the "stony grey soil of Monaghan" - shallow rooting depth; poor chemical properties and steep slope.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461"> My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are working on sourcing and analysing the data in respect of the new criteria. Department officials have also been in contact with the joint research centre and the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development in the European Commission regarding technical issues arising.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462"> Over the coming months, this analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel be subject to a refinement process. The categorisation of designations, such as hill or mountain areas, and linked payment levels will be examined based on the outcome of the technical work I have outlined. It is envisaged that stakeholders will be consulted as this process develops.</p>

            <p eId="para_1463">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as ucht an fhreagra sin. This is very important. I take it from what the Minister has said that there is no absolute commitment to retain the designation of mountain-type land within the scheme. This is critically important. Even an examination of how it has fared regarding costings already advised in previous parliamentary questions would show that it makes absolute sense that farmers trying to make a living on mountain-type land need more support than those in less constrained lowland areas. There is much concern about this, not just among the constituents of Deputy Kenny, who tabled this question; it has also been brought to my attention in my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, particularly in the Cavan end of the constituency, that there is real concern that the review which is under way will involve a flattening of payments. This would spell serious consequences for those who are trying to eke out a living in the most difficult and most challenging of circumstances. Could the Minister offer some reassurance in this regard? It would be much appreciated.</p>

            <p eId="para_1464">The Deputy will be aware that there is a specific commitment in the programme for Government to restore some of the ANC cuts made in previous years to the tune of €25 million in 2018. This is a welcome step in the right direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">It does not travel the full road of recovery from the cuts inflicted at that time by a Fianna Fáil-led Government but we are committed to making some redress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466"> The challenge we face in terms of ANC is to hold what we have. I am committed to that. We have to operate within the biophysical criteria that the Commission has laid down. That analysis is under way. We will have maps and will engage in consultation in due course. It is very early to talk about categorisation within areas designated as suffering from a natural constraint according to these biophysical criteria. My primary objective is to retain classification as we have it. That is not to be underestimated because the criteria have changed from socioeconomic factors to biophysical criteria. Thereafter, we can consider, with the assistance of the €25 million extra that will be available in 2018, classification within areas deemed to have constraint.</p>

            <p eId="para_1467">While the Minister indicates a commitment to retention, he will appreciate that I am anxious to have a reference specific to mountain-type land and that designation. The Minister has not used that language in his response to me. Could he please for the sake of clarity give me that certainty? That is the primary concern for those who have raise the matter with me. The existing scheme payments do not reflect the actual constraints and have been further diluted by political intervention in recent times. That cannot be ignored. The payment bands are too narrow with only €13 separating the mountain-type land payment of €95.99 and the lowland severely handicapped payment of €82.27. It does not address the real difference that farmers are having to contend with in those different settings and areas of their work.</p>

            <p eId="para_1468">My understanding is that there will be potential for tiered levels of designation, as is currently the case, within the final designation. The objective now is to secure disadvantaged status against the set of biophysical criteria. Within that status, there will be provision for tiered designation as is currently the case. There are various designations throughout the country. The gap is slightly wider because the islands attract a significantly higher level of payment. That tiered approach will, I hope, remain an integral part of the system. It is far too premature to talk about what areas may now be designated which status. We have to work to the criteria laid down. I envisage a tiered approach at a later stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1471">There are currently just under 24,500 participants in the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP. This scheme builds on the previous nationally funded pilot beef genomics scheme 2014 and can provide a lasting positive impact on the national suckler herd both in terms of genetic gain and environmental sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472"> The scheme is now firmly established and its benefits are already clearly being seen. Its credibility as a progressive and meaningful scheme for suckler farmers is well known and there are consistent demands for reopening it in respect of new applicants as a result of this. This is being examined in the context of an assessment of budgetary availability, the operation of the rural development programme and the potential impact on this and other schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473"> The calls to reopen the scheme are very much a positive reflection on the experience of those who are currently participating in the scheme. The scheme, combined with other measures introduced by my Department - such as the mart modernisation scheme - has concentrated the minds of suckler farmers on the genetic quality of their herds. When making breeding decisions for their beef herds, commercial farmers are doing so based on both economic and scientific data, which is easily accessible to them when purchasing replacement stock using Eurostar data displayed clearly at mart ringsides. This is an example of two Department schemes complimenting one another in a positive manner. The BDGP is an important factor in driving continued efficiencies in Irish suckler production.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474"> The suckler sector is a vital component of Ireland's rural economy and the provision of support for it is critically important. The range of supports as currently configured represents a balance between direct income support for the sector and measures designed to improve its competitiveness and sustainability. It is entirely appropriate to maintain this balance of developmental and income supports into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475"> I have recently returned from a successful trade mission to the Middle East where I again saw at first hand the high esteem in which Irish beef is held by consumers for its taste, animal welfare standards and environmentally-sound production systems. The reputation of Irish beef as a premium sustainable product was one of the key factors in gaining enhanced market access in Saudi Arabia The BDGP aims to reinforce these vital qualities by further enhancing our production to be at the forefront of Irish and international efforts to tackle climate change. The benefits that this scheme will bring to the Irish suckler herd are cumulative and permanent and are an essential element of the future sustainability of producing beef from our suckler herd.</p>

            <p eId="para_1476">The Minister's response is not satisfactory, particularly in view of the pressure on the beef industry and our suckler cow herd and the fact that two or three months from now we will be half way through this Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, funding programme. As yet, the beef data and genomics programme is not at the capacity which was outlined. There are only 24,500 farmers in it, although the Government committed to having 35,000. I asked the Minister if he would reopen the programme and ensure it goes up to the capacity in that commitment but unfortunately he is not giving a clear response. It is absolutely crucial that our beef sector is supported. This is a key measure for it. The minimum the Minister needs to do is reopen it immediately. We need increased payments to support our suckler herds and ensure that farmers stay in the programme. For example, replies to parliamentary questions indicate that the Minister could increase the payment under the current programme to €200 on the first 20 cows for a sum of €40 million. We need the Minister to be open to measures like that otherwise our beef sector will go down.</p>

            <p eId="para_1478">It is somewhat reassuring to find that a scheme which, in its early days, was the subject of much criticism, not least from those in certain quarters on the other side of the House, is now one that all quarters are anxious to have because they recognise its merit and want to have it extended further.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479"> I am constrained in respect of the beef data and genomics scheme by the funding available under the rural development programme. Of course, that fact is contrary to the myths Deputy McConalogue has been pedalling, in this Chamber and elsewhere, to the effect that there is a crock of gold out there that we just do not want to spend. We are engaged in a very extensive review of expenditure commitments under the rural development programme but there is extremely limited, if any, room available for manoeuvre. I am conducting that review and it will be an interesting challenge for Deputy McConalogue to nail his colours to the mast and say, given what limited space is available, how he would propose to manoeuvre within it. He talks about €200 support for a suckler cow but has never said whether that is to be a top-line cut in basic payments for every farmer, whether it is Pillar 1, Pillar 2 or Exchequer funding. The beef data and genomics programme is funded under the rural development programme. As already stated, I am conducting a review on the overall scope available to see if there is latitude to open the scheme at a later stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1480">The Minister unfortunately does not seem open to the idea of properly supporting our suckler and beef herd in the way required to ensure that it is sustained. He should know, as I and many others do, that across the country the suckler herd is depleting and people are considering getting out of it. Teagasc indicates that it is between €4 and €4.50 to break even. Beef is being sold for considerably less than that at present and this is not sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481"> Will the Minister give a commitment to reopen the beef data genomic programme? The Minister asks me what proposal I would make but he should live up to the commitment he and this Government gave on how the rural development programme would be funded and the extent to which it would be funded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">He committed to provide €52 million per annum for the beef data genomics programme, but we are well under that at the moment. We have been well below our targets in this regard in recent years. A similar situation applies across the rest of the rural development programme. Whether they like it or not, I will continue to hold the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to account to ensure they spend the money the Government has committed to spend - no more and, in particular, no less. There is capacity for the immediate reopening of this programme and for looking at how the unspent commitment which has been built up so far can be delivered to farmers within the programme period that was promised.</p>

Tariffs and taxes on fertiliser in Europe are costing Irish farmers approximately €32 million per annum. This is making Irish commodities uncompetitive against imports from outside the EU. It is also affecting dairy farmers, who had a desperate year last year because of low milk prices, and grain farmers, many of whom are in danger of going out of business. Beef and sheep farmers are badly affected too, as are the 8,000 or so GLAS farmers who are still awaiting their payments from the Department. Is the Minister taking steps at European level to highlight the problems caused by the tariffs and taxes on fertiliser?</p>

            <p eId="para_1491">I am aware that fertiliser costs comprise a significant area of expenditure on Irish farms. I strongly believe the elimination of fertiliser tariffs and anti-dumping duties could help farmers to reduce their input costs.  According to EUROSTAT, fertiliser is the third most important expenditure item on EU farms, accounting for €19.2 billion of expenditure in 2014. Fertiliser prices have increased significantly in recent years, partly due to the protection provided by the imposition of duties on non-EU imports. Opportunities to manage price risk through hedging mechanisms have also been limited. In February 2016, the International Food and Policy Research Institute published a report on the effects of import duty elimination on competition in the EU fertiliser market. The report concluded that the protection afforded to EU manufacturers by the application of anti-dumping duties and customs tariffs is costing farmers up to €1 billion per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492"> Against this background, I asked the Commission to consider a temporary suspension of customs tariffs and anti-dumping duties on fertilisers in the lead-up to the March 2016 meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council. I actively pursued this issue at Council level throughout 2016 with the Commission and in consultation with Council colleagues.  I raised the issue again at the January 2017 meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, when I asked the Commission to address the significant overpricing of fertilisers in the EU brought about by the imposition of anti-dumping duties on imports. Commissioner Hogan acknowledged the desirability of bringing about lower prices but indicated that it was proving difficult to achieve, despite considerable efforts on his part with other member states and internally within the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493"> The 2016 payments under the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, represent the first full year of payments under the scheme.  They are being paid in weekly instalment runs as issues with outstanding GLAS cases are resolved. Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis, with payments valued at over €110 million now having been issued. Over 84% of participants have now been paid.  All GLAS applications must pass regulatory controls and validations, as is the case with all EU co-funded schemes. The outstanding cases are being reviewed on a case-by-case basis to resolve the individual issues in each instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1494">While I appreciate some of the steps that have been taken, this issue is unfortunately taking many farmers who are purchasing fertiliser at the moment right over the edge. I also appreciate the steps the Minister has taken to provide cheap finance to farmers, but I am aware that some farmers who are looking for such finance are being turned down by banks. While the provision of €150 million is a start, I have been told it would not solve the problems in the pig sector alone, never mind the problems all across the farming sector. The big uptake of low-interest loans proves that there are huge cashflow problems on many Irish farms. I am aware of the continuous delays in making GLAS payments because many farmers are ringing my office to say they have not been paid. They are probably ringing the Minister's office as well. We have been told that these delays are caused by a technical issue. As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs a strike of a hammer against a machine might sort it out. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is failing to sort it out. How can 8,000 farmers still be waiting for the GLAS payments? It is unjust and unfair in times when people are struggling. The cost of fertiliser is taking many farmers over the edge. I ask the Minister to intervene personally. The Minister mentioned Commissioner Hogan, who needs to stand up for Irish farmers in the dairy, beef and grain sectors, who are struggling at present. The grain sector is awaiting compensation that was voted for in this House. That money has to be given to the grain farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1495">As I said in my response, I have raised this issue at European level. I appreciate that the cost of inputs is something we can endeavour to address. I have raised this issue at meetings of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council. Commissioner Moscovici, rather than the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Hogan, is responsible for anti-dumping tariffs because it is a competition issue. Obviously, this issue has been raised by Commissioner Hogan at Commission level. I would be less than honest if I failed to acknowledge that this initiative does not have widespread support. There are member states with significant indigenous fertiliser industries that are protected by these tariffs and anti-dumping levies. That adds a cost to agriculture. Nonetheless, I am personally committed to continuing to raise this matter. I do not think it would be accurate to say this issue lends itself to an easy solution. I should mention in the interests of accuracy that there are not 8,000 GLAS farmers. The number of farmers remaining in the scheme is approximately 5,000. I acknowledge that this is 5,000 too many. We are doing everything we can to address that issue. There is ongoing engagement between my Department and the farm organisations on the grain issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1496">The Minister has said that giving farmers relief in respect of the increased cost of fertilisers caused by tariffs "does not have widespread support" in Europe. This is one of many serious issues for Irish agriculture at present. What steps are being taken by the Minister to deal with those issues? It looks to me that something is being done this year, but what has been happening in the last number of years as this problem has been growing? As I have said, many farmers are struggling greatly. I would like the Minister to elaborate on the technical issue that is holding up the making of GLAS payments to 5,000 farmers. I mentioned 8,000 GLAS farmers earlier because that was the figure a number of weeks ago. If someone in Schull has a technical issue, he or she will get a man to sort it out within half an hour. I cannot understand why it seems to take three months for such issues to be sorted out in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Is a belt of a hammer needed to sort it out? It sure as hell is not being sorted out at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497"> We had a vote on a compensation programme for grain farmers here. The Minister should remember that his Government did everything possible to stop the grain farmers from getting compensation. The Government lost that vote so why have the farmers not yet got their compensation? The people, through this Dáil, voted against the act of not giving that compensation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1498">I have not heard from Deputy Collins about the way compensation might be paid. As I stated to others, where there is a way there is a will. We are still searching for the way and we have not heard any detailed proposals from the Deputy on that. We would be very interested to hear about that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499"> What are the technical issues? They are myriad and are as many as there are applicants awaiting payment, which is the unfortunate reality. We are working through those on a case-by-case basis. Some of them relate to actions associated with individual plots and some concern plots that may have been split. Some of them relate to the correlation between the green, low-carbon agriculture scheme, GLAS, actions and the basic payment application submitted. There are almost as many as there are individual applicants waiting to be paid. The issue is each individual application must be eyeballed and there must be a solution found for each application. If the Deputy has a man in Schull who can sort these out in half an hour, we would be delighted to hear from him or her. There is a very dedicated team in the Department working on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500"> I apologise to farmers who are awaiting payment and I appreciate their position. We are working through this as quickly as we can and, as I stated, 84% of farmers have been paid. I understand the position of those still awaiting payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1503">When the EU milk quota was abolished in April 2015, some 6,400 Irish dairy farmers had accrued a superlevy liability of €71 million for exceeding their milk quota. To assist with the large superlevy bill across the EU, the European Commission introduced an optional scheme for member states whereby a milk quota levy incurred by producers in the final quota year could be paid in equal instalments over three years from 2015 to 2017, inclusive, without interest. This repayment would take the form of a 33% lump sum in 2015 and the balance to be spread over equal instalments in 2016 and 2017. Ireland was one of seven member states which opted to introduce this scheme. Ireland chose to implement the scheme so as to assist farmers through a period of market volatility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504"> The Department paid the full superlevy bill of €71 million to the European Union in November 2015, made up of €35.4 million collected from farmers that year and €35.6 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine funds. This latter figure was required to be paid back by farmers under the instalment scheme as a condition of the governing regulations. Approximately 2,700 producers opted to pay their full levy in 2015, while the remaining 3,700 opted to join the instalment scheme. Repayments are therefore as follows: €17.8 million was paid in five equal instalments from May to September 2016 and €17.8 million is to be paid in five equal instalments from May to September 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505"> The first instalments were due in May 2016 and were repaid in each month up to September. These months were chosen to coincide with peak production periods for farmers. End-of-year results indicate over 99.7% of the expected payment was received. The outstanding debt for 2016 is now down to three participants owing €12,700. My Department is in ongoing contact with these farmers to arrange their repayment as required under the relevant regulations. To date, €53.2 million of the €71 million in respect of this scheme has been returned to the Exchequer, with the 2017 instalment balance making up the remaining liability. It is expected that by the end of this year, the entire superlevy will have been repaid in full by farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1506">Is there an issue in the repayment by instalments being factored into the Department budget for this year? Is the money required for other schemes? Is it an issue or is the Minister satisfied that this is progressing in the way he expected? I presume from the Minister's reply that the sharp fall in the global price of milk had a bearing on how this was handled and that is why people were given the option of an instalment plan. Was it predicted in advance of the levy being dispensed with?</p>

            <p eId="para_1507">The rationale for the scheme was twofold. There was a very significant superlevy bill not just in Ireland but across the European Union and a number of member states decided to avail of the latitude offered by the Commission in paying the superlevy over a period rather than up-front. It was also a reflection that at the time, milk prices began to go south, which put additional repayment capacity difficulties on farmers. The staggered approach was welcomed by farmers. I accept that welcome as it was, in a very difficult year in 2016, it put farmers to the pin of their collar. It is interesting to note that 99.7% of the liabilities due have been paid in the year and the total bad debts are from three farmers, totalling €12,700. In light of the overall cost, it is not a bad level of compliance in what was a particularly difficult 2016. Global dairy markets have recovered somewhat and that graph is going in a different direction, fortunately, as prices are on the up. That will give farmers some leeway and breathing space in terms of commitments. The Department is budgeting on the liability being met in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_1510">On 29 October 2015, the Chinese food import authorities wrote to the Irish Embassy in Beijing expressing concern about the levels of the heavy metal cadmium in live crabs coming from Ireland, which the Chinese authorities determined exceeded Chinese limits. The Chinese authorities requested that Ireland ensure only crabs which meet the Chinese standards for cadmium be permitted for export. European legislation sets a limit of 0.5 milligrams per kilogram for white muscle meat from the limbs only. The Chinese authorities are currently applying this limit to all crabmeat. I understand that crabs take in cadmium, which is a naturally occurring element, from the environment and it builds up in the brown meat of the crab to much higher levels than the white meat. I am advised by the Marine Institute that Irish waters have very low cadmium levels. It is important to bear in mind that heavy metals occur naturally at low levels in the marine environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511"> In view of the Chinese request to meet this Chinese standard for live crabs, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, Ireland's competent authority for seafood safety, certification and sea-fisheries conservation, notified Irish crab exporters of the new monitoring requirements and the difficulties this would pose for the authority in providing health certificates for live Irish crabs intended for export to China. Ultimately, the implementation of food regulations for imports into China is a matter for the Chinese authorities. Ireland applies the stringent European standards and follows procedures, which include monitoring the safety of Irish seafood, so consumers can continue to have high confidence in the quality of Irish seafood.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512"> As part of efforts to support the trade of compliant safe seafood, a memorandum of understanding is in place with the Chinese import authorities that allows for technical dialogue. The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority continues to work with Chinese import control officials on this market access issue, supported by officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. A visit to Irish crab production and State laboratory facilities by Chinese import control officials was hosted in May 2016. Following this, there has been continuing communication between the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and Chinese officials on this issue. The matter was further discussed between Irish and Chinese experts in the course of Ireland’s trade mission to China in September 2016. A further visit by Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority experts to China is being arranged for the near future. The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, my Department and the Department of Foreign affairs and Trade are continuing strenuous efforts to secure agreement with Chinese officials for resumption of this trade at the earliest possible date.</p>

            <p eId="para_1513">The Minister's response gets to the nub of the problem. This has been left to be dealt with at official level with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Chinese officials. France was subject to the same ban, which lasted for eight months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">The UK was subject to the same ban, which lasted 12 months. Here we are, 16 months down the road and we still have no access, whereas France and the UK have had access restored. The only explanation one can arrive at is that there was intervention at a political level in France in the UK that allowed exports to resume. It is hard to escape the thought that if this were the pork industry, people would be going over non-stop to try to have it reinstated. However, nothing is happening regarding the live brown crab. To add insult to injury, Irish live brown crab is being exported to France, repackaged and exported to China. How does it make sense? The only explanation can be that there is no involvement at a political or diplomatic level to resolve the issue and that it is being left to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_1515">That is not the case. On a delegation to China, I raised the issue, supported by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, with the Chinese authorities. While the Chinese market is very important for us, so is the certification we give, not just to seafood but to all our other food exports. I appreciate the Deputy's point, and the fact the meat is being exported, repackaged and sold on to China is interesting. Our certification process is critical to the offering we make all over the world in respect of all our foodstuffs. We do not want to diminish it in any way and we are not prepared to sign something we cannot stand over regarding the technical requirements the Chinese are imposing on us. We are engaging at a very senior level politically, diplomatically and technically in my Department with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Marine Institute in an effort to ensure we reopen the market, which is particularly important. It is not for want of engagement at any level, and I hope we can make progress on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1516">It is hard to escape the fact that the French overcame the issue in eight months and the English in 12 months, whereas 16 months later we are still here. I am sure the French are providing certification which meets the standards the Chinese can accept. It seems to me that there is no action. Maybe we should ask the French for advice on how they overcame the issue. A substantial market is potentially available. In 2015, one supplier sent 225 tonnes to China at a value of €1.8 million. We could potentially have had an export market of more than €5 million this year if this had not been in place. Surely the French are very proud of their standards of certification in their food industry. I am sure the English are too. Here we are, it has been almost double the time and we have no access.</p>

            <p eId="para_1517">I understand the Deputy's point. At face value, it appears illogical that our crab is purchased by other EU nations and resold. The integrity of our certification process is critical, not just to crab meat to China but to every other product we certify for markets all over the world. If we in any way diminish the standing of the certification process, there would be a domino effect. My officials are right to insist they stand over the certification process. Cadmium is a naturally occurring metal which is as prevalent in our crab meat as it is in French or UK crab. However, our certification process has an integrity on which we are not prepared to compromise. We are engaged in very complex, technical, scientific negotiations with the equivalent authorities in China on the matter. Last September I was in the room when the matter was raised with the Chinese authorities in the presence of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority. While I cannot definitively say when the matter will be resolved, it will not be for want of commitment at all those levels to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1520">HRI is a commercial State body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 and is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the horse racing industry. The current foal levy scheme, which was introduced in 2000 on a statutory basis, applies to all thoroughbred foals registered in Ireland. The foal levy is calculated with reference to SI 735 of 2011, which is the governing legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521"> HRI's foal levy committee reviews the rates, bands and structures of the levy annually and has also considered potential alternative methodologies to calculate the levy due. It has concluded that the current banded or tiered approach represents the most equitable and appropriate way of securing the vital funds needed for the breeding sector. The majority of foals registered fall into the two lower bands of €35 and €50 and there is a very high compliance rate of 98.3%.</p>

            <p eId="para_1522">Some of these issues were discussed at the committee. The high compliance rate is linked not to the fact that people believe the system is fair but that they cannot register their foals with Weatherbys unless they pay the foal levy and this is the point that is made to them. At the heart of the issue is the bizarre scenario whereby people pay the stud fee based not on the actual price they pay but on the advertised price. This does not exist anywhere else. People find it incredibly inequitable. They are not saying they do not want to pay anything. They have done calculations which show the small owners and breeders are being most hard done by.</p>
            <p eId="para_1523"> When we raised it at the committee meeting, we were told it would be an administrative nightmare to change it. That is utterly ridiculous. Weatherbys administer it. It already receives documentation from everybody who wants to register their foals. Why not add a document which gives the stallion fee and shows the amount of foal levy paid? It is perfectly simple. Every other business can do it. The excuses being put out are not valid. People want to know what initiative the Minister can take to break the logjam.</p>

            <p eId="para_1524">As the Deputy said, the matter is still before the courts. Nonetheless, I do not want to hide behind that in so far as possible. Approximately 12,000 thoroughbred foals are born every year. The alternative view suggests that, rather than the nominated fee, HRI should be able to operate on the basis of the actual fee. It would be difficult administratively. For example, what is the fee in the unusual circumstance in which the stallion and mare are owned by the same person? What is the cover fee or registration fee in that situation? There are so many different permutations in the context where no fee is paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525"> The funding secured from it is put to very good purposes. It funds the Irish Equine Centre, the Irish Thoroughbred Marketing Service and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association. There is a high compliance rate. In recent years, the HRI foal levy committee has introduced a broader banded system in order that the majority of foals born are in the lower fee category. There has been progress. I do not like to see such matters before the courts. I wish they could be resolved. The high level of compliance suggests the vast majority of people find the situation reasonably satisfactory, notwithstanding that nobody likes to pay anything.</p>

            <p eId="para_1526">The Minister, and Deputies from all parties and none, know well that is not the viewpoint on the ground. It is not good enough that the Minister abdicates responsibility to the HRI foals subcommittee or to the courts. The judge who is considering the matter is considering the fact it is a matter of such public importance that he is considering referring a case stated to the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">Given that we know there is disquiet across the board - all the Fine Gael Deputies here will confirm that - and in view of the fact that there is a problem at which the courts are looking, would the Minister be prepared to sit down with interested parties and discuss a fairer alternative to this situation? Is the Minister aware of the submission of any falsified documents on these matters with regard to prices? The way it is done now is very convoluted but the solution is quite simple. An invoice that shows the fee actually paid can be used to determine the levy. I do not know how in God's name that is an administrative nightmare. Shopkeepers and everybody else seem to be able to manage that. Limited and all as it is, I believe Horse Racing Ireland could manage that also.</p>

            <p eId="para_1528">This entire process was reviewed in 2011. The outcome was that the number of bands increased from six to 11. The majority of registrations are now costing between €35 and €50. In the context of a thoroughbred foal, I do not believe that is an exorbitant amount. As the Deputy said, the matter is before the courts and it would be preferable if it was possible for both sides to find some middle ground. There is little point in having a statutory board with responsibility in respect of this area if I was then to delve into the middle of the situation to take on the duties the board is statutorily obliged to carry out. There is a sub-committee of that board and it has dealt with and reviewed the matter. I do not see any immediate role for me, as Minister, to intervene in that matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1535">Coillte was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act 1988 and day-to-day operational matters, such as the management of their forest estate and land transactions, are the responsibility of the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536"> Killykeen Forest Park is located on the shores of Lough Oughter and consists of approximately 240 ha. Coillte advises that the company has no major investment plans for Killykeen Forest Park but that it is currently working with Cavan County Council to examine the way in which public recreation facilities at the park may be improved and if this may involve engaging a service provider, for example, in bicycle hire, canoe hire, etc. Coillte advises that the company is also developing a longer term management plan for the recreation facilities at this park.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537"> Killykeen holiday village is located in Killykeen Forest Park.  The holiday village, which has 28 log cabins for guests, is located on nearly 74 acres with 1.7 km of shoreline to Lough Oughter and forms part of the larger 240 ha forest park. It was placed on the market in June 2016 by Coillte.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538"> In the context of the sale of the holiday village within Killykeen Forest Park, I am advised by Coillte that it remains on the market. As I have previously indicated, Coillte was established as a private commercial company. The sale of the holiday village is, therefore, an operational matter for Coillte and details of any offers made are confidential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539"> As part of its management of some 442,000 ha of the national forest estate, I note that Coillte has more than 3,000 km of trails, 260 recreation sites and 12 forest parks across the State. Coillte forests provide a range of recreational opportunities for the general public, continuing a long tradition of open access to State-owned lands. I understand that the general public greatly values these forest recreational facilities and I am pleased to note that Coillte is actively engaging with Cavan County Council with a view to improving the public recreation facilities in Killykeen Forest Park in the short-term. I understand that there are currently four signposted walks and a family cycle trail in the forest park. I am also conscious that such recreational facilities are also very valuable resources as tourism attractions in the various regions. I apologise for going over time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1542">The Minister outlined some of the wonderful Coillte owned amenities across Cavan and Monaghan. When I say this, I am thinking of the Castle Lake and Forest in Bailieborough where local community groups, such as the Bailieborough Development Association and the Bailieborough Castle Lake Committee, today planted 2,000 hardwood trees to commemorate victims of the Troubles. Other amenities include: Dún na Rí Forest Park, located north of Kingscourt; Dartrey Forest Park, which straddles the border between Cavan and Monaghan; the Cavan Burren and the Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark, located 4 km south of the villages in west Cavan and Belcoo in County Fermanagh; and the Killykeen Forest Park. The Minister has outlined Killykeen's fantastic amenities and at 240 ha it is by no means a small project or forest park to have in our county. It has the potential to be a wonderful facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543"> My point is that these are hugely important attractions in counties Cavan and Monaghan but they need investment. If the Minister of State has been to Killykeen Forest Park holiday village, then he would know it has had a huge deficit of investment. As a result, we are losing one of the most important tourist attractions in the county, and we do not have many of them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1550">There was no interest and no sale in 2006. In 2009, it appeared there would be a sale but it failed to be finalised so the holiday village has been for sale since. I understand there has been some pretty intensive and active engagement but it has not gone the full way yet. In fairness to Coillte, I would not ask for, nor would I expect it to tell me, the details of the levels of bids. The holiday village complex is, however, expected to realise a reasonable amount of money, which would be used to develop part of the overall national forest park strategy. Coillte had planned to launch the national forest recreation policy very shortly but it has had to be deferred to another date. This is a new development Coillte will be rolling out.</p>

            <p eId="para_1551">I thank the Minister of State. We must maximise the potential of the natural amenities and attractions that are on our doorstep. The Minister of State alluded to it and we can see what is happening in Ballymahon. The multi-million euro investment by Center Parcs there will create local employment and it has huge potential for counties such as Cavan and Monaghan. That template could be replicated across the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552"> I have had the experience of working with local groups and it is important to acknowledge these groups. There are a number of groups in each area of the forest parks that I have cited. The Grand Gardens, for example, is a community group initiative at Kingscourt, County Cavan. The group had a project idea, had done some work with Coillte to develop one of the historical walled gardens and had completed some preparatory work and a lot of ground work to develop the garden as a local amenity in what is already a fabulous park. When it came to further engagement, however, the group could, unfortunately, only get so far with Coillte. When it came to long-term leases, it seemed to meet a brick wall. Coillte must become open to the idea of working with community groups who have so much to offer around voluntary support and work in community areas. The people in the community groups are from the areas and have a natural passion for the amenities and want to see them developed. We should tap into that. It is a missed opportunity for Coillte to not engage with community groups of that sort.</p>

            <p eId="para_1559">Under the EU regulations governing the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system, must be completed before any payment can issue.  My Department, as the accredited paying agency, must ensure that, before payment issues, everything in an application that can be checked is checked as required under the regulations. Therefore, payments can only issue where all the required validation checks have been successfully passed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560"> In regard to 2016 payments, under AEOS, the previous agri-environment scheme, just over 8,600 AEOS participants were due a payment. AEOS 2 participants completed their five-year contracts on 31 December 2016. Under the EU regulations governing this scheme and all other area-based payment schemes, a full check, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system, must take place before the final payment can issue. As all AEOS 2 participants will be receiving their final payments under the scheme, re-checks on payments made for all scheme years must be completed before final payment can be processed. This is the same procedure as applied to AEOS 1 participants finishing in that scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561"> To date, AEOS 2016 payments amounting to over €22 million have issued. The remaining cases are currently being checked and payments will continue to issue on an ongoing weekly basis as these cases are cleared. A total of 84 farmers in County Wexford were due a 2016 payment in AEOS, of whom 51 have been paid and 33 are awaiting payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562"> The 2016 payments represent the first full year of payment under GLAS. At the end of December 2016 there were approximately 37,500 active participants in the GLAS scheme, of which 27,400, or over 71%, received payments valued at over €97 million, representing 85% of their 2016 payment. As issues with outstanding GLAS cases are resolved, they are being paid in weekly payment runs. Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis, with payments valued at over €110 million now issued and over 84% of participants now paid. Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563"> Some 778 farmers in County Wexford are active in GLAS 1 and a further 271 are active in GLAS 2, of which 627 in GLAS 1 and 227 in GLAS 2 have successfully completed the GLAS prepayment checks in respect of the 2016 scheme year and a first payment instalment of 85% has issued. The current position is that 151 farmers in GLAS 1 and 44 farmers in GLAS 2 have yet to receive their payment and their applications continue to be processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1565"> Outstanding payments under both GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 are largely delayed due to declaration of incompatible parcel usage on the basic payment scheme application for a chosen GLAS action; changes in parcel boundaries on which a GLAS action is chosen, including splitting or merging of parcels; an applicant no longer claiming a parcel on their 2016 basic payment scheme; incomplete documentation such as incorrect information on low-emission slurry declaration; incomplete interim commonage management plans; and incompatible data and parcel history on Department databases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1567">Obviously, this question concerns delays in payments under the agri-environment schemes, GLAS and AEOS. There is mounting anger over the delay in these payments and we saw protests recently outside Johnstown Castle in County Wexford. These are farming families whose patience is running out at this stage. They were expecting these payments before Christmas and they have not yet received them, and families are suffering as a result. We need to see an element of urgency on this issue in order to get these payments out. While I appreciate there have been a number of issues, most should have been anticipated.</p>

            <p eId="para_1568">I previously stated on the record of the House that I very much regret the delay in these payments. Whether it is in Wexford, Meath or any other part of the country, I do not find it satisfactory. However, I would say the officials in this area of my Department, both IT and administrative, are working without constraint in terms of overtime and so on to try to resolve the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569"> By way of information, approximately 2,000 cases are failing a prepayment validation check for one or more of the claimed GLAS actions. A further 2,500 cases have issues with the consistency of the parcel data on the Department's databases. The remaining cases relate to cases that have outstanding errors with the annual basic payment scheme application. In total, there are approximately 5,000 left to pay. While we cannot quantify it yet, it is anticipated that a sizeable number of those will not qualify because they never activated their applications after submitting them. However, we are working to try to ensure that those in County Wexford and elsewhere get payment. I will not rest until all of those are paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570"> I appreciate that it is not in compliance with the farmers charter and that is something we are not happy about. Although this is cold comfort to anybody waiting, we have rolled out more schemes under the rural development programme than any other EU member state and our drawdown of funds is well ahead of any other member state. Nonetheless, I accept this is unsatisfactory.</p>

            <p eId="para_1571">The Minister is correct it is not in line with the farmers charter. At a time when farmers are facing Brexit threats, sterling fluctuations, income uncertainty and price volatility, the last thing they need is a further delay in payment. Will the Minister set out whether there is a definitive timeframe for addressing the delays in GLAS and AEOS payments? There is a concern there is no sense of urgency on this issue, given some families are waiting over five months for payments. The Department had two years of preparation in order to get this right and none of the difficulties being experienced were unexpected. Some 194 families in GLAS and 33 families in AEOS are awaiting payments, which is almost 40% of the numbers. Each one of those numbers represents a family. They need those payments and they need to know when they are going to get them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1575">The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine laboratories are an integral part of the Department, providing critical scientific evidence and expertise in animal health, food safety and plant sciences, which allows the Department to function effectively as a regulator, to deal with new and emerging risks and to rapidly respond to disease outbreaks and food safety incidents. The laboratories also provide valued services and advisory support to the farming community, the food industry and wider society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576"> The ambitious targets of the agrifood industry for growth and development over the next decade, as set out in Food Wise 2025, must be underpinned by robust systems which protect and enhance our reputation as a producer of safe and wholesome food. One of the ways in which we must respond to this challenge is by developing a long-term strategy for the laboratories, building on existing capability and expertise in animal health, food safety and plant sciences, and ensuring we achieve both operational and scientific excellence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577"> This was the primary reason for tasking a working group, led by Professor Alan Reilly, to undertake a comprehensive review of the Department’s laboratories. This review has considered both the central laboratory complex at Backweston and the eight regional laboratories located at Athlone, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Sligo.  The group has presented a report to the Department which makes recommendations on the following: oversight and co-ordination of the laboratories activities; reorganisation of divisions and support functions within the central laboratory complex; options for the future development of the regional laboratories with a view to improving disease investigative and surveillance capability, but with the overriding imperative of maintaining and enhancing services to farmers; and human resources management within the laboratories with a focus on grading structures, career development opportunities and workforce planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578"> My Department is currently consulting with all relevant stakeholders. A decision on any of these recommendations will await the outcome of this consultative process. In the case of the regional veterinary laboratories, any decision will also be informed by a cost-benefit analysis of the various options that have been proposed for their future development.</p>

            <p eId="para_1579">I thank the Minister for his response. It is absolutely correct that we should look at all times at how a service is provided. Particularly regarding veterinary and scientific services to the agricultural community, we must ensure that those involved have the resources, facilities and back-up necessary to be able to perform that function to the highest possible standard. The concern with regard to the ongoing review has been particularly related to the regional veterinary laboratory network. There are proposals and options in the working group report put forward which involve a closure of some of those regional veterinary laboratories. It involves the closure of Sligo, for example, which is referred to in my question, and there is also grave concern for Limerick and Kilkenny.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580"> The Minister will know, from feedback he received from them, how important this regional veterinary laboratory network is to farmers in the regions. For example, with regard to the closure of Sligo, for farmers in the part of the world I come from in north Donegal, the nearest laboratory would be Athlone. It is simply unacceptable that farmers in times of distress who require autopsy services for animals would have to avail of a service that is that far away. The regional veterinary network is absolutely essential. In his final comments, the Minister - apart from noting the resources and the scientific facilities and equipment that will be available - indicated that the regional veterinary laboratory will be looked at in the context of a cost-benefit analysis. There is never any doubt that one office in a central location with all of the staff in it may, from a cost-benefit point of view, be a cheaper way of providing services. However, the key point is that the regional veterinary laboratory network is critical. The service is very important. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial that the Minister, the Department and the review group keep that in mind. Certainly, from my party's perspective, it is crucial that that network is protected and given the resources and facilities necessary to provide the service it is expected to provide.</p>

            <p eId="para_1581">I hear loud and clear the geographical message. I appreciate the importance of a geographical spread. The one assurance I have given is that there will be no diminution of service to the farming community in respect of this. It preceded my appointment, but it was right and proper that Professor O'Reilly was given <i>carte blanche</i> to look at the current service, critique it and make a series of recommendations. He is an internationally-renowned scientist. He has done some sterling service both in this country and abroad. I felt it was appropriate thereafter to put that out into consultation with the staff. They are the people whose role is critical to underpinning the industry and the manner in which we are able to travel the globe and stand over the product that we have. I salute all of the staff that are employed across the regional laboratories and at Backweston. That consultation process is ongoing. In a way, it is unfortunate that there has been an element of scaremongering by farm organisations and others. No decisions whatsoever have been made about the future structures. I made that point to staff to whom I have spoken. It is right and proper that they engage and put their best foot forward in respect of the service that is there now. It is a critical service for the industry and I acknowledge what it has done, but I equally think that it was only right and proper that Professor O'Reilly would have been given the broadest possible scope to critique the service and make recommendations for the future. Those recommendations are the subject of public consultation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1582">I think it is a bit simplistic and dismissive of the Minister to talk about the farming community scaremongering or about people being concerned about this. Options have been put forward. They were pulled out of thin air. One of the options for consideration would involve the closure of some of these veterinary laboratories. Another is that they would all be amalgamated into one centre. I do not think it is unfair to expect that the farmers would become concerned about that being on the table for consideration and would make their views known on that basis. It is right that they should do so. People always become concerned when they hear commentary regarding cost-benefit analysis. Too often, what that means is that all of the emphasis is on the cost and not enough is on the benefit. What is key is that there is recognition in this review of the importance and benefit of the regional veterinary laboratories to the regions and to farmers who live there and that they remain part of the overall service. That service is provided to a great standard across all offices and there must be investment in order to ensure that this remains the case.</p>

There is a report that was compiled by an eminent person who has internationally-recognised expertise in this area. That report is now the subject of consultation with the staff. That is where matters stand. There is no recommendation to close any regional laboratory service. It is wrong to create that impression. The people who work in those laboratories have been done a disservice by the heightening of fears regarding closure. We would be rightly criticised if we did not occasionally critique ourselves against what is best practice in order to underpin the offering that the industry makes globally in its safety, provenance, etc. That is what these regional labs do. There is a process under way and staff should engage in that.</p>

            <p eId="para_1592">Under the EU regulations governing the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system, must be completed before any payment can issue.  </p>
            <p eId="para_1593"> My Department, as the accredited paying agency, must ensure that, before payment issues, everything in an application that can be checked is checked as required under the regulations. Therefore, payments can only issue when all the required validation checks have been successfully passed. As issues with outstanding GLAS cases are resolved, they are being paid in weekly instalments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594"> With regard to 2016 payments under AEOS, the previous agri-environment scheme, just over 8,600 AEOS participants were due a payment. AEOS II participants completed their five-year contracts on 31 December 2016. Under the EU regulations governing this scheme and all other area-based payment schemes, a full check, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system must take place before the final payment can issue. As all AEOS II participants will be receiving their final payments under the scheme, re-checks on payments made for all scheme years must be completed before final payment can be processed. This is the same procedure as applied to AEOS I participants finishing in that scheme. </p>
            <p eId="para_1595"> To date, AEOS 2016 payments amounting to over €22 million have issued. The remaining cases are currently being checked and payments will continue to issue on an ongoing weekly basis as these cases are cleared. A total of 83 farmers in County Meath were due a 2016 payment in AEOS, of which 68 have been paid and 15 are awaiting payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1596"> 2016 payments represent the first full year of payment under GLAS. At the end of December 2016, there were approximately 37,500 active participants in the GLAS scheme, of which 27,400 or over 71% received payments valued at over €97 million, representing 85% of their 2016 payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597"> As issues with outstanding GLAS cases are resolved they are being paid in weekly payment runs. Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis with payments valued at over €110 million now issued and over 84% of participants now paid. Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1602">I welcome the statement from the Minister and the figures he provided, as well as the statement he provided earlier to Deputy Browne in the context of this matter. Why was there not an effective system in place before this point in time, given the frustration felt by farmers? It was agreed between the farming organisations and the Department that up to 75% of payments would commence in the third week of October with the balance of the payments being made in mid-December. It was reported in <i>The Independent</i> farming section this week that farmers still waiting on payments may have to wait until mid-summer. If that is the case, some farmers will have waited for seven months in total.</p>
            <p eId="para_1603"> I have met many farmers in my constituency in Meath over the past few months. I saw earlier that Deputy Burke has a parliamentary question as well about part of his county in the Castlepollard region of north Westmeath, which comes into my constituency as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">They have had great difficulty making contact with the Department to query the reasons for the delay with the payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605"> I know what the Minister has said with regard to there being no issues in terms of overtime to prioritise this matter. I appeal for this to be taken with a greater sense of urgency. What is being done specifically in that respect?</p>

            <p eId="para_1606">I thank Deputy Cassells for his understanding. I appreciate the imperative that he has laid down in terms of getting these payments out as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607"> GLAS is probably the most complicated of schemes. There are over 30 separate menu options available to farmers under the scheme. When we cross-reference those actions to the basic payment application, the individual plots therein and the actions, it gives rise to a complicated scenario that, in turn, has given rise to difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608"> The truth is that in December when we pressed the "pay" button, we had hoped that everyone would be paid and had financial provision made for that. Unfortunately, as the record shows, a substantial number were not. We continue to work through all of these. The reality is that we have had to eyeball every application to find out the specific issue, whether there is a fundamental problem relating to the basic payment application or a question of plots that are split and actions on plots that do not correlate. Another question is whether the problem goes back to an error in our processing. It is complicated but I assure the Deputy that it has the necessary urgency. I cannot specifically give a time but I assure the Deputy we are making every effort to get these payments out quickly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1609">I thank the Minister for the candid nature of his response. It is helpful even in terms of outlining the complexity. The majority of the cases of farmers that I have been dealing with in Bellivor and Castlepollard relate to access to information and the frustration they are experiencing in that respect. They have had to make financial adjustments because they had money earmarked for projects on their farms. Those projects would have increased productivity and profits. Instead the resources have had to be put into basic day-to-day bills and the running of the farms. The Minister and his colleagues are well aware of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610"> Many farms, especially in disadvantaged areas, have low margins within which to work. These delays are not fair on the farmers concerned or their families.</p>

            <p eId="para_1611">I know we have discussed this issue in the Chamber on several occasions. What has happened is absolutely unacceptable. The Minister indicated in his response to Deputy Cassells that the Department expected that when those responsible pressed the "pay" button in December everyone would be paid and that the Department had the money allocated for that. However, it turned out differently. That is not acceptable. Surely with proper preparation these issues could have been highlighted in advance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612"> I know the Minister has said today that he does not want to give a date for the outstanding payments since he may not be able to stand over it. However, those who have not been paid yet were given a date that the Minister has been unable to stand over, that is to say, last December.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613"> Recently, I was in a field with bird cover. The farmer had completed the action. It is working well in terms of wild birds coming to use it. However, the farmer has not yet been paid for the work done. Many farmers were expecting the payment last December. Now they face a wait until the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614"> There needs to be a major review in the Department of how this came about. Politically, we need to know how the problem was not spotted in advance and why the proper resources and preparations were not put in place to deal with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1615">Apart from the basic payment scheme GLAS is, by a country mile, the most popular scheme with the Department. This is because of the most recent addition of approximately 13,000 new applicants. In the early part of 2016 a further 12,000 new applications were submitted as well. It is a remarkably successful scheme. It is also complex.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616"> With all sincerity I suggest that regardless of who would be standing in this position, the situation would not be different. We are rolling out more schemes, including complex schemes. This week, we are launching the tillage TAMS scheme. That scheme was rightly demanded by the tillage sector. There are myriad other schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617"> It is a challenge to keep the information technology systems up to speed. We could take a different approach. We could decide to try to get everything right to the nth degree before we roll out anything else. However, what we want to do is get the schemes out to farmers. We are getting payment to them. We are late with payments. I confess that and I put my hands up. However, I assure the House that we are doing everything we possibly can to get the payments out as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1621">Since December 2016 there have been 12 confirmed cases of the H5N8 strain of avian influenza in wild birds in Ireland. In Northern Ireland there have been two confirmed cases in the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622"> In Europe, the virus was first detected in Hungary on 28 October. Events have evolved constantly ever since. There have been over 1,000 events recorded, 405 outbreaks in poultry, 29 in captive birds and 574 cases in wild birds. These cases have been recorded in 20 member states in 2017 as well as 750 cases in 2016. Hungary and France have had the highest number of outbreaks in poultry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623"> The situation is unprecedented in terms of the number of events and countries affected. If the epidemic is prolonged, as it was with the H5N1 strain in 2006, it could go on until May. There is also concern that HPAI H5N6, which is currently in South East Asia and has affected humans, could appear in Europe during the next migratory season.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624"> On 23 December last my Department announced regulations under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 requiring flock keepers to confine all poultry and captive birds in their possession or under their control in a secure building to which wild birds or other animals do not have access and to apply specific bio-security measures. This is the first time such action had been taken by this Department. The requirement to keep birds confined was extended on 23 January 2017 and it remains in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625"> I note that this week the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland announced the lifting of a compulsory housing order from 17 March. However, that Department intends to retain an avian influenza prevention zone until the end of April. This measure is designed to allow poultry owners to let their birds outside, but introduces some additional bio-security requirements for those that chose to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626"> My Department has engaged in ongoing consultation with stakeholders, including producers and representative organisations regarding the possibility of the requirement for birds to be housed remaining in place after 17 March 2017. I have carefully assessed the epidemiological situation in Ireland; the number and distribution of findings in wild birds; advice with regard to migratory patterns of wild birds over the next number of weeks; the continued need to protect, as much as possible, Irish flocks and the industry from exposure to infection; the continued retention of OIE avian influenza-free status by Ireland; and Ireland's continued access to third country markets. In this regard I announced on 8 March my decision to continue the confinement notice that is currently in place beyond 17 March, until 30 April 2017, at which time the confinement notice will end. The decision reflects a careful assessment and evaluation of the information and data specific to Ireland and is in the best interests of the poultry industry in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1628">The priority interest is indeed the poultry industry. As a representative of Cavan and Monaghan I cannot but be aware of how important that is to our local economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629"> The question is not to press the Minister; it is to establish the position. I note from the Minister's reply that he is intent on continuing the housing order until 30 April. Will the Minister review it in the intervening period? Is the date set by the Minister absolute and not for reconsideration?</p>
            <p eId="para_1630"> I thank the Minister for the reply to my parliamentary question that I received recently on the matter instancing the identified or recorded cases. Can the Minister indicate to us how up-to-date the associated figures are? Do they reflect recent recordings? That was not clear from the reply given by the Minister. Is there a period leading up to our engagement this afternoon during which there has been no recorded instances? How up to date or current are the recorded cases of bird deaths as a result of the avian flu?</p>

            <p eId="para_1631">I suspect the figure I gave - 12 confirmed cases - is up to date. These matters tend to be in the public domain as soon as they are identified. There may be cases of which I am unaware that are under scrutiny in the laboratory services to confirm whether the deaths are due to avian influenza but I suspect the figures are the most up to date figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632"> We took a range of issues into account. These include migration patterns and epidemiological factors. A critical point is that we have OIE international certification that our confined poultry flocks are avian influenza free. This is important in terms of the market access it gives us. The United Kingdom does not have such status, meaning Northern Ireland does not. The industry in the Deputy's constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, exists cheek by jowl with that in Northern Ireland. Our position is different from that in the North in that we have OIE acknowledged avian influenza free status. That allows us to have unaffected markets. If we were to have an incident, the status would disappear.</p>

            <p eId="para_1633">The Minister referred to 12 cases. My question was not implying this is not the most up to date information; it was to ascertain when the cases occurred. Did they occur in February last, for instance, or further back in time? Has there been a period during which there was no recorded incident?</p>
            <p eId="para_1634"> With regard to the control measures, is the Minister giving any consideration to a review to help to identify cases? How satisfied is the Minister that there is wide public awareness and knowledge of the threat presented to the poultry sector by avian influenza? Have members of the public been clearly informed, to the Minister's satisfaction, as to what reporting procedure should apply on the discovery of wild birds that may have died as a consequence of the avian influenza virus?</p>

            <p eId="para_1635">The first incident was in Wexford on 30 December 2016 and the remainder of the 12 cases arose, on a rather frequent basis, in the intervening period. I do not have the exact date of the most recent case but I recollect it was not that long ago. This would have informed the steps we took.</p>
            <p eId="para_1636"> I acknowledge the assistance of the public. The first incident, which was in Wexford, was brought to the attention of the Department by a member of the public. Tests confirmed avian influenza. There have been incidents in Galway and all around the country since. Departmental communication was specifically geared towards the industry itself in terms of the steps it can take, through biosecurity, to minimise the risk. We cannot even guarantee that, by retaining the flocks indoors, we will avoid avian influenza. It is, however, the best possible course of action to minimise the risk. I do not propose a review between now and the end of April. As with others, I obviously hope that will be the time of the final order to retain flocks indoors. We will have to keep the matter under review at that stage given the incidents. It is critical to note that migratory activities will have peaked and subsided by that stage. These are contributory factors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1637">At least seven young adults with disabilities who have been allocated day service places in St. Michael's House here in Dublin are unable to gain access to those places due to the absence of funding to cover transport. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this is a shocking predicament for the service users and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638"> One of the people affected left school in June last year. After seven long months at home, his family received word that he had secured a day care place at St. Michael's House, Adare Green. I am told the building is not yet ready so the service will be situated in Baldoyle for the foreseeable future. Needless to say, the family was delighted to secure this place for their son, who has complex special needs. Their joy was soon taken away, however, when they learned there was no funding available to take him to and from the facility. To access the facility via public transport would require four bus journeys each way. Travelling by bus is not an option in any event due to the severity of the individual's needs. He is unable to travel unaccompanied and both his parents work so they are not in a position to bring him.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639"> Another case of which I am aware concerns two brothers, one of whom is a day centre attendee at St. Michael's House, Baldoyle. He was recently accepted into St. Michael's in Bunratty Road, Coolock, but is yet to receive a start date. The other is in an adult day centre in Raheny. Both boys, who suffer from a global development delay, were provided with transport when they attended national school. Since the funding for transport has been axed, they have been struggling to come to terms with their changing routine. Their mother contacted me and said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1640">I cannot describe to you just how difficult it is for them to have changes made to their routine. One of my sons has been in day care since February 2015, with no transport, and has still not got used to this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">I understand St. Michael's House has said it is unable to provide funding for transport as it is not within its funding allocation. I raised this matter with the Minister of State recently during Questions on Promised Legislation and he replied he had recently met senior management of St. Michael's House to discuss funding and the amount of funding that has gone into the social care disability service plan for 2017. He confirmed the budget for transport within St. Michael's is taken from its own budget. I understand that, in order to provide a bus, driver and escort for six to eight people - it would depend on the number of wheelchairs among their number - some €65,000 per annum would be required. It is not major money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1642"> This is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently. It is wholly unfair on these young adults with disabilities and their parents that they are being denied transport. It should be a given that funding would be in place to allow them to gain access to services provided for their needs. They should not have to fight for something like this. I ask the Minister of State to intervene immediately to ensure that all people allocated places in St Michael's have access to transport to and from these essential services.</p>

            <p eId="para_1643">I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of transport for people with disabilities attending HSE funded day services, particularly St. Michael’s House. I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position in this regard. I will also deal with some of the individual questions the Deputy asked.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644"> The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE funded day services is not a core health service, but I am fully aware of how important transport is for people with disabilities who attend day services. As a general rule, public transport should be used in all circumstances where it is an option. I accept the Deputy’s point that some disabilities are complex so public transport is not an option. This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible. It must be noted that, in general, day service users are in receipt of a disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the free travel pass so there should be no additional cost at an individual level. That relates particularly to those individuals with disabilities who are on their way to independent living or able to access public transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645"> New developments to meet the needs of school leavers with disabilities who require continuing HSE funded supports each year are located as close as possible to where people reside so as to reduce the travel time for each person and enable them to be more connected with their local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">Funding is not provided to service providers for the transportation of young people to and from day services. The HSE is aware of the difficulties being experienced by parents with regard to transport for school leavers. In this regard, one of the options is to arrange transport and cover the cost by reducing the quantum of service the clients would receive. However, it is my understanding that this option is not viable in the context of St. Michael's House as the clients in question are not attending day services in the same location.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647"> The HSE has also committed to establishing a high level, cross divisional working group this year to rationalise the provision of transport and to maximise equitable access and efficiencies. The HSE also intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and disability service providers to explore ways in which the authority’s services could assist people with disabilities. I understand that the NTA has a total of 17 transport co-ordinating units, called Local Link, which provide safe, secure and reliable public transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled public transport and door-to-door services. The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648"> I would add that I will be meeting representatives from St. Michael's House in the very near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1649">While I thank the Minister of State for his reply, I must say, with considerable regret, that there is no solace in his response for the families involved. The Minister of State said that the HSE "plans to explore" and so forth but all of this amounts to no early resolution of the difficulties with which these families are contending. This is critically important and I urge the Minister of State to personally intervene with the respective authorities, that is, the service providers, the HSE and transport providers of whatever hue in order to guarantee a continued service for this small cohort of young adults with serious disabilities. They are unable to access the services that have been allocated to them and which were determined as essential for their respective care plan needs. It is imperative that a solution is found.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650"> The point was made that as a general rule, public transport should be used in all circumstances where it is an option and I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has acknowledged that is not an option for any of the young adults to whom I refer. These seven young people are severely challenged and could not possibly face the use of public transport and certainly not unaccompanied. The departmental reply made reference to covering the transport costs by reducing the quantum of service the clients would receive but that is penalising the young people. It is totally and wholly inappropriate and is not an answer in any circumstances. At the end of the day, scheduled public transport is not the answer in this case. Door-to-door service is required. Indeed, the two brothers to whom I referred are not going to the same centre as St. Michael's House has a presence in several locations across the city and beyond. </p>
            <p eId="para_1651"> It is very important to recognise in this instance that we are talking about a special group of young adults who need our assistance now and I am making a special appeal on their behalf.</p>

            <p eId="para_1652">I have listened carefully to what Deputy Ó Caoláin has said about these particular seven young people. I accept his point that within the disability community there are young adults with intellectual and physical disabilities who have complex needs. I accept his argument in that regard. However, it must be noted that St. Michael's House received €72.7 million in funding in 2016. Deputy Ó Caoláin suggested that it would cost approximately €65,000 to provide transport for the seven students in question and I will be putting that point to the representatives from St. Michael's House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653"> I am very familiar with the services provided by St. Michael's House. There are children and adults with complex needs who avail of its services and who have been provided with the type of transport service to which the Deputy refers. Some of those children live in Marino and Deputy Ó Caoláin is talking about a group of families who live in Baldoyle and Bunratty Road in Coolock. The Deputy has asked me to personally intervene on their behalf and I will do so. I will raise the Deputy's concerns with St. Michael's House. </p>
            <p eId="para_1654"> The issue of transport for children and adults with very complex needs must be addressed. While I acknowledge that a high percentage of people with disabilities are capable of independent living and can use public transport to attend their day services, no one should miss out on day services because of transport issues. I will do my best to intervene because it is imperative that young adults with physical and intellectual disabilities are able to attend the day services to which they are entitled. Their families also deserve support. I ask Deputy Ó Caoláin to afford me the opportunity to look at these seven particular cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1659">I am very glad that this item was accepted and am pleased that the Minister of State is here to respond.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660"> I wish to refer to services provided by Enable Ireland for children up to age six and by the HSE's child development team for children aged from six to eight in Cavan-Monaghan. My comments are informed by my constituency work and by ongoing contact with parents of children with a disability, particularly autism. I know from replies from the HSE to representations I have made on behalf of constituents that there has been an increasing volume of referrals to the Cavan-Monaghan child development team. The HSE has publicly acknowledged that referral rates for children in Cavan-Monaghan have increased significantly in recent years and, consequently, waiting times have also increased. </p>
            <p eId="para_1661"> The HSE has identified additional staffing as a priority in Cavan-Monaghan and I sincerely hope that the Minister of State will be able to provide the necessary resources to ensure that an adequate complement of professional staff is based in Cavan-Monaghan. Families need to be able to access the required professional services for children at the appropriate time. Delayed assessment, intervention and service provision for children at the formative time in their lives are not acceptable. </p>
            <p eId="para_1662"> I know from speaking to parents that Enable Ireland provides an excellent service in Cavan-Monaghan. However, parents have made representations to me with regard to the delays they are experiencing in obtaining ASD diagnostic assessments. I understand from parents who have had interactions with Enable Ireland that it is providing services to approximately 430 children aged up to six in Cavan-Monaghan. This includes children with a named disability or a delay in their development, as well as children presenting with features of ASD.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663"> Every child who is accepted onto the Enable Ireland programme goes through an initial assessment period to identify his or her needs before an individual intervention plan is put in place. Where there are concerns about a child presenting with possible features of ASD, Enable Ireland discusses the matter with the family and places that child on the waiting list for an ASD diagnostic assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">Last weekend, a parent told me that she understood that more than 70 children are awaiting the ASD diagnostic process in Cavan-Monaghan. As we know, the diagnostic process requires assessment by a psychologist, a speech and language therapist and an occupational therapist because the gathering and integration of information from multiple sources strengthens the validity of a diagnosis and age-differential diagnosis in young children. This parent was extremely well informed through interaction with other parents of children with autism and through different support groups. She told me that Enable Ireland would only have one whole-time equivalent psychologist post to meet the needs of 420 children across Cavan-Monaghan. If that figure is accurate, the Minister of State will see a huge deficit in that professional service. I have to accept the word of that well-informed parent who gave me that information. With such a limited resource, it is extremely difficult to work through that ASD waiting list in a timely manner while also trying to provide some psychology supports to the other children in the service and to provide support to preschools and schools attended by the children. There are huge demands on that professional service provided so well by Enable Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665"> Service providers also have to deal with the assessment-of-need process. The relevant legislation requires that referrals received through the assessment-of-need process must be responded to and children must be assessed within a specific timeframe. When the local service providers try to respond to the needs of the children who are presented by parents or by schools and also through the assessment-of-need process, the service providers then have a huge difficulty. Do they only respond to the referrals that come by way of assessments of need, meaning that the other children's assessments will be delayed? There is a conflict and a difficulty for the service provider in the context of meeting the needs of the children while adhering to the timeframes set down in legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1666">I thank Deputy Brendan Smith for raising this matter. On a recent visit to Monaghan, I met him and Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin. I thank the people of the area, including many of the parents we met at the intellectual disabilities facility in Monaghan. I also saw examples of good practice in the Monaghan area. I was delighted to find that Monaghan is the only area in Ireland that does not have a congregated setting. All the settings are located in smaller community houses. It was a very important and historic day as far as I was concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667"> I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to the provision and development of services for children with special needs, and to improving access by these children to assessments and therapy services, in so far as is possible, within available resources. In the Cavan and Monaghan area, the school age team provide autism services to children aged between six and 18 years and Enable Ireland provides services to children from zero to six years old under the early intervention team. The autism spectrum disorder service within each team is multidisciplinary in nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668"> Unfortunately, there are staff shortages in a number of disciplines, despite much effort going into filling these posts. Currently, there is only one senior clinical psychologist in post in the school-age team covering both counties. I accept the Deputy's point. As a result, the psychologist's capacity to meet the demand for assessment and intervention for children with autism is limited. The demand for this service continues to outweigh current capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669"> Recruitment for a second psychologist continues to be actively addressed as recruitment campaigns to date have proven unsuccessful. There is the gap in the system. I accept it is not acceptable and we have to ensure we fill that post. There are similar recruitment issues in the areas of speech and language therapy services, and in occupational therapy services. I assure the Deputy that the HSE is committed to fill these posts and reduce waiting times for assessments and therapies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670"> In the meantime, the Cavan-Monaghan disability services school-age team continually reviews existing waiting lists and is in the process of reconfiguring services to provide greater access for children requiring a multidisciplinary team autism assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671"> The HSE has recognised that early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively and this process is well under way nationwide. The HSE's national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people from zero to 18 years aims to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway to services for children with disabilities and their families, regardless of where a family lives, what school the child attends or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672"> The programme has entailed targeted investment of €14 million and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff, in order to increase services for children with all disabilities. In 2016, €4 million was provided under the HSE's national service plan to focus specifically on speech and language therapy waiting lists in primary care and social care for children up to 18 years old. This investment represents a long-term increase in speech and language capacity that is being maintained in 2017. It is acknowledged that waiting times to access required assessments are high in some areas, including Cavan-Monaghan. There has been continual additional investment in this area in order to support the HSE as it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory timeframes which apply to the assessment-of-need process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1673">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. As he said, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin and I had the pleasure of accompanying the Minister of State that evening in Clones when we met families and the support groups. Excellent work is being done by community groups throughout Cavan-Monaghan. The Minister of State would be very welcome to visit the area again. I know of his personal commitment to this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674"> Whenever there is a shortage of resources there is a risk of creating a two-tier system whereby the children coming through the assessment-of-need option will be seen and the children being referred otherwise will not be seen. The danger with the lack of resources in Cavan-Monaghan is that Enable Ireland, as the service provider for children up to the age of six, could become an assessment service only and would not be in a position to provide the interventions and the services we all want to see provided for the children. We do not want Enable Ireland, for example, just to become an assessment service because it does its job so well and professionally in delivering services where it has the necessary resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675"> I understand that in the Cavan-Monaghan area the number of children aged up to six years of age presenting to Enable Ireland has more than doubled since 2008, which indicates the demand for the services and the need for the additional resources for that area. All of us through our ongoing constituency work meet parents who are utterly frustrated. Neither the family development team with the HSE nor Enable Ireland is able to advise parents of when assessments will be carried out and this is adding to the difficulties and concerns of parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676"> I welcome that the Minister of State will encourage the HSE to ramp up its efforts to recruit additional professional staff to try to ensure this is prioritised. It is much needed as he recognised in his contribution and as he will have heard from parents and support groups that evening in Clones.</p>

            <p eId="para_1677">I will not accept a two-tier system. However, I accept that we cannot have an assessment service only. We have to move on that. There are huge demands on existing services. As the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, it is my job to ensure we develop these services. As I explained earlier, we have a problem recruiting people. Unfortunately, the disability services have been drained over the past seven or eight years. We are now trying to catch up and reinvest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678"> Sadly, many of our speech and language therapists and educational psychologists have gone to other countries. We have an issue trying to fill posts, in this case in Cavan-Monaghan. My job is to get the HSE moving to fill the posts. I also accept the Deputy's point about the frustration of parents. Failure to intervene early will damage the children and will also cost more in terms of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">The social care disability service plan for 2017 has a budget of €1.688 billion, an increase of 6% from last year. I accept that there are major problems, but we are trying to reinvest. I want to reform and focus on the person with the disability. That is my vision and strategy. Let us see if we can go ahead and do it.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Lahart<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1680">I am grateful my topic was selected. I am not carrying a battering ram but actually ringing the doorbell to see if we can open a proper conversation on it. I want to see if there is any movement that can genuinely make a difference to the lives of some people, particularly older people, affected by this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681"> All Members will have occasional experience of this issue. I will not say there are queues outside constituency offices, but that makes it all the more important that we do not overlook it. I was dealing with the case of a constituent who was appealing a decision not to give her a disabled driver and passenger tax concession. Two years ago she appealed and did so again recently. She does not meet the strict criteria in place for the scheme from the medical board, which is acceptable. However, she has limited use of her limbs in being able to access her car. She does have some use of her, as she puts it, good right leg. Her left leg is only a balance, while her left hip to the knee is stiff at all times. The bottom line is that she is 83 years of age and her car is her lifeline to many activities in the community in which she is engaged. She cannot use public transport because of her inability to mount steps and high footpaths without the use of a stick. She cannot be the back seat passenger in a car because of the lowness and depth of the seats. She also has difficulties in negotiating the front passenger seat. At home, she has an electric stair lift, electronic bed and other aids. Maintaining her mobility and independence for as long as she can was her prime reason for her appeal which has been turned down on two occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682"> She appealed the decision to the Ombudsman, as she was advised to do when her first appeal was refused. I am raising the issue because her appeal was refused again in March 2015 and also because the Ombudsman’s advice is two years old. The Ombudsman effectively told her that there were criteria in place and that he could not help her. However, he is concerned that the scheme, as framed, is overly rigid and inflexible and may well be causing inequality. He has raised his concerns with the Department of Finance. While it has indicated that it does not propose to make further changes to the scheme in the immediate term, it has undertaken to consider the points raised by the Ombudsman. According to it, any possible change to the current eligibility criteria can only be made after careful consideration. That was two years ago. Where does it lie now? We were promised a review. The Ombudsman is concerned that the existing system is too rigid, not flexible and should be examined. The Department gave a commitment that it would be. Although it does not involve the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, will the Minister tell me what point we are at and what message on policy I can bring back to my elderly constituent who very much relies on her car for independence in life?</p>

          <speech by="#ShaneRoss" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_313">
            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1683">I acknowledge the issue raised by the Deputy. While I obviously cannot comment on a specific case as I do not know the full details, I recognise the bona fides of what the Deputy has said and that there is a difficulty in the case. I am quite prepared to look at it in a different forum, in other words, not in a public forum, to see if anything can be done. What the Deputy is really saying is the criteria under the scheme are too strict such that it is impossible for some people who lack the necessary mobility to qualify to use disabled parking spaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684"> The provisions on the use of the disabled parking permit scheme are set out in section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 (Sl 182 of 1997), as amended. The scheme is administered by the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association. The disabled parking permit is available to people living in Ireland whose mobility is severely and permanently restricted, whether they are drivers or passengers, and to people who are registered as being blind. The permit has been designed in accordance with EU legislation and is recognised in all EU member states. It is valid for two years from the date of issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1685"> In 2010 the Department conducted a review of the disabled parking scheme, in consultation with various stakeholders. One of the issues looked at was eligibility for the scheme. Disability groups, in particular, were unhappy at the fact that some people were being issued with disabled parking permits because they had a particular condition rather than a mobility impairment. For example, cardiac conditions which can severely limit mobility entitled people to a permit at the time but not all sufferers of the condition have a mobility impairment. As a result of the review, the scheme was revised in order that permits would be given based on the level of mobility impairment rather than diagnosis of a particular condition. It seems to be a fairly discretionary and subjective judgment. The medical criteria for issue of the permit are strict and only persons whose mobility is severely and permanently restricted qualify. The primary legislation for the purpose of issuing EU parking permits defines a disabled person as, “A person with a permanent condition or disability that severely restricts their ability to walk”. This definition was introduced into the Irish regulations by the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (Sl 239 of 2011).</p>
            <p eId="para_1686"> Primary medical certificate holders are considered to qualify having already met the criteria and are only required to submit a copy of their certificate with their application form. Similarly, those who are visually impaired are only required to submit confirmation that they are registered as being blind with their application form. For all other applicants, a medical practitioner must complete the medical section of the application, describing the applicant’s level of mobility and certifying the accuracy of same. If the discs are to be provided for a wider group of people without further action, I fear there would be increased demand placed on the already limited number of parking spaces available. To that end, I have been actively involved in raising awareness of the unfairness of using such spaces where it is not justified. I also strongly support a recent Garda campaign to crack down on the fraudulent use of these spaces and permits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687"> In response to the case raised by the Deputy, I will write to my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, to consider directing local authorities to make provision for more parking spaces for disabled people. If we receive a positive response, I hope we will be able to give serious consideration to having more serious criteria which might embrace people in the category which the Deputy addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688"> My Department remains in ongoing contact with the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association. I remain open to considering any improvement to the scheme which may be needed in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1689">I thank the Minister for his reply. I initially said I was not coming with a battering ram precisely for the reasons the Minister has laid out, namely, that it is important to keep such schemes reasonably strict and confined so as not to have all and sundry seeking a disc or the scheme abused. While it was relatively liberal, there seems to have been a complete clawback.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">What it does is exclude people like my 83 year old constituent who wrote to me in the most beautiful handwriting about how she manoeuvres herself on to the driver’s seat using the car door, steering wheel and inside roof grip. She uses her left hand and arm and her right leg and foot to lift her body into her driving position supported by a cushion for height and back support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691"> That is pretty challenging but rather than labour the issue here I wanted to raise it and to get an update from the Minister on the current position. He has given me an update and indicated he will take up the matter with his colleague, the Minister with responsibility for the environment. That would be a practical solution to examine but I might provide the details to the Minister separately. I would welcome some examination of this issue, particularly but not exclusively with respect to older people. It is about the people's quality of life when we consider this 83 year old, independent, single, widowed woman who depends on her car for her independence and to engage in her activities. Any slight flexibility in this scheme could provide a better quality of life for her and for other people in her position. I am grateful for the Minister's openness to address the issue and I will communicate with him further on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1692">I have very little to add except to say it might be more appropriate to give this specific case to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, than to me but I would be quite happy to pass it to whoever is the right person and have it looked at. The Minister of State has just passed me a note stating he is working on a new motor transport Bill for 4,700 people with disabilities and it might be appropriate to be included in that as well. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is not one who is shy of taking on issues of this sort and applying new criteria to the sort of issues the Deputy has raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693"> I do not know if this is indiscreet but I will say it anyway. The case the Deputy has made seems to be a case of lack of mobility and in several instances a lack of mobility has been found not to be the case. Let us try to reconcile those but make sure that people who come into the category the Deputy mentioned, without being specific, are included in the future because if they are immobile, they should be entitled to park in these spaces. The idea of increasing the number of spaces will allow us to broaden the criteria.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Rock<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1694">This is an issue the Minister of State may not be fully aware of and I appreciate her taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Bruton. In effect, it concerns a school based on the edge of the Minister, Deputy Bruton's constituency of Dublin Bay North and my constituency of Dublin North-West. Gaelscoil Cholmcille on Oscar Traynor Road has applied for a developing school status, which would allow for an extra class in the school. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, had met representatives from the school who outlined the demand for an extra class this year and forthcoming school years. As the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, might be aware, there is a strong demand for Gaelscoileanna both across Dublin and throughout the State and the demand has increased in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695"> According to a letter - which I have seen - from the Gaelscoil to a parent who is a constituent of mine, the Department has stated there are sufficient school places in the local area to cater for the demand. However, the school claims that these are not places in a Gaelscoil, which they are not, as there are no other local Gaelscoileanna. While there are places available for a child to enrol in a school, they are not available for the particular type of school in which the child wishes to enrol. While I fully appreciate that an assessment is ongoing in terms of the status of the school and the possibility of it opening a second stream of classes, however, schools such as Gaelscoil Cholmcille encourage the school experience through the Irish language, a love of learning, tradition and culture of this country. The option to send their child to such a school should be straightforward for parents, yet they face rejection letters consistently or are added to long waiting lists. </p>
            <p eId="para_1696"> Allied to this, another aspect was brought to my attention when I met one parent whose child was rejected for class enrolment. The parent had paid for basic Irish lessons in order that their child could be up to speed in the language going into the school. A great many parents may not be proficient in the Irish language and Irish may not be spoken in the home but they have the aspiration for their children to speak the language and a great grá for it. Even if they do not speak it, they want their children to speak it. That is admirable and it means that parents who want their children to go to a Gaelscoil incur an expense perhaps in advance of applying for enrolment to a Gaelscoil and this should also be acknowledged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697"> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is trying to confront the issue of more diverse education choices being available to parents and he must be commended on that work to date. Since my election in Dublin North-West, I have witnessed an Educate Together secondary school opening, which is great. We have not had that choice before. Plurality of choice is a very good thing in education. We also have had a commitment of a primary school to accommodate prospective pupils in the Finglas west and south areas with the patronage currently open for tender, for which there are a number of different bidders from different school backgrounds. While these schools are most welcome in these areas, I still believe there is more to be done, which is something with which I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, would agree.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698"> Census 2011 showed that 14,000 of the population of Dublin city identified as a daily Irish speaker. This shows there is still a clear appetite for our national language in the capital. I imagine we will see an increase in that number when we receive the full final published results of census 2016. </p>
            <p eId="para_1699"> While I fully understand why a parent would wish to have their child immersed in our national language from such an early age, I fully believe that in recent years we have perhaps lost touch with our national language, something which many young parents, in particular, are trying to rectify. The Government should commit to assist this wave of education in the Irish language. I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his Department will continue their fine work in opening up the education system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1700">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Bruton. I thank Deputy Rock for raising the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the current position relating to Gaelscoil Cholmcille. For the Deputy's information, I will outline the background to the establishment of Gaelscoil Cholmcille. It is recognised by the Department as a co-educational single-stream primary school catering for pupils from junior infants to sixth class. The current staffing at the school is a principal plus nine mainstream teachers and two permanent resource teachers. Due to the number of pupils enrolled, the school currently has a staffing complement of nine mainstream teachers. However, it continues to be recognised as a single-stream school by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701"> In 2007, the Department agreed to buy a 2.7 acre site from Dublin City Council to provide accommodation for the school. Planning permission was granted in 2007 to construct a two-storey building containing 12 classrooms and ancillary accommodation. The Department constructed the new school on this site at a cost of almost €1.4 million and the building was occupied in April 2008. All statutory approvals, including planning permission, were secured for the development. The planning permission granted does not limit the period that the structure is allowed to stay in place. The expected lifespan of the school building is in excess of 25 to 30 years. More recently, the school has written to the Department seeking permission to develop the school to a two-stream 16-classroom school. This would require the construction of an additional eight classrooms. The school is making the case that it wishes to accommodate all applicants, as well as those children who may potentially emerge from the proposed residential development on the Dublin City Council lands at Oscar Traynor Road.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702"> I wish to inform the Deputy that the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, recently met representatives of the school relating to the matter. Following this meeting, the Minister requested his Department to re-examine the demographic pressures in the catchment area. This work is now under way. This will involve examining future trends in enrolments in the school planning area, which includes Gaelscoil Cholmcille, and assessing the availability of capacity in all of the existing schools in the area. </p>

            <p eId="para_1704">This school in effect straddles two constituencies: Dublin North-West and Dublin Bay North. In its back garden, in effect, is a large brownfield site ripe for development. It is quite clear that this will see development most likely through 2018 and 2019 and therefore the demographic pressures in this area and on this school will continue to increase. Both constituencies at large are subject to huge population growth. My own is one of the fastest growing in the country, so I can clearly see the case and can clearly see that this is now in process. The Minister has met with representatives of the school and parents whose children attend it and I can see that he is listening to them. I therefore appreciate the contribution of the Minister of State on behalf of the Department on this occasion. I will continue to do my work on behalf of the parents and those concerned in the area in respect of the school. I thank the Minister of State for her contribution. Perhaps I will raise the matter again in the future.</p>

I understand perfectly well where the Deputy is coming from and the real need to give parents choices in the education of their children. Because Gaelscoileanna all across the country have become very popular in the past number of years, particularly in the Dublin region, there is probably a need to develop further from the current position. Regarding the Minister's commitment on the demographic demands, as he outlined, he has met the school principal and they are looking to re-examine the demographic pressures in the catchment area. As Deputy Rock said, this is now on the way. I hope there will be a greater response to his question in the future and that the Minister will be able to fill him in on time as the weeks go on.</p>

            <p eId="para_1706">There is a clear acknowledgement of the future pressures that might build up here. The work the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is doing in general is encouraging, but it is great to see in this specific case that he and the Department are planning for the future and considering this in a holistic, cohesive manner. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, would be familiar with the great groundswell of enthusiasm for the Irish language which is building right across the State, certainly within Dublin. Dublin South-Central and Dublin North-West have become areas of great groundswell for the language. I appreciate the Minister of State's honest response to the question and thank her for it.</p>

        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_321">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1707">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1708"> I apologise to all the staff being dragged in here at this hour on a Thursday evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1709"> The Bill will provide for a universal jurisdiction of human rights; enable the charging and conviction of persons who breach international human rights law in cases of, but not limited to, genocide, war crimes, torture and crimes against humanity, whether these breaches have occurred inside or outside the State; and, for these purposes, amend the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act 2000 and the International Criminal Court Act 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_1710"> The principle of universal jurisdiction is an essential tool to reduce the unevenness in the sphere of international justice. Currently, officials and decision makers from powerful states are at a remove from justice, while those from weaker states are not afforded this unfortunate layer of protection. The responsible use of universal jurisdiction is essential if we are to work towards a world in which crimes against humanity do not go unpunished, no matter where the perpetrators come from.</p>
          <p eId="para_1711"> The jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is limited, with only 110 states parties. The Rome Statute of the ICC is not universally ratified and it does not have jurisdiction over crimes committed before July 2002. Without the principle of universal jurisdiction, this situation leaves us with safe havens all around the world and no justice for crimes committed over 15 years ago. These are just the technical issues, completely overshadowed by the political reality that the ICC is being, and has been, strangled by the UN Security Council and that it is no longer fit for purpose. The veto powers have corrupted both the council and the ICC so that the acceptable face of terrorism - the US, the UK, France, NATO and others - can protect themselves from justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1712"> Universal jurisdiction plays a central role in the enforcement of international humanitarian law and the conditions for opening criminal proceedings or justifying a refusal to open them must be clearly defined at national level. It is essential that the legislation be properly used to prosecute war crimes, using both national and extraterritorial jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713"> We have the Geneva Conventions, the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and many other fundamentally important laws that are abused every day, so often without consequence. The world order to which successive complicit, right-wing Governments of Ireland have unfortunately subscribed, whereby, to paraphrase Denis Halliday, powerful states use military might to make the rules for their exploitive, political and natural resource greed, is palpable and explosive in the Middle-East, Africa and elsewhere, and makes a mockery of the notion of international justice and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1714"> In 1984, the United Nations Convention against Torture was signed by all nations bar a small handful. In recent years, we have seen the travesty of Abu Ghraib, the CIA dark site prisons, Guantánamo Bay, the rendition programme and the CIA torture report, and there has been no justice. About four years ago, a debate even opened in America about the legitimacy of torture. The current US President, the man our leader is going over to have an awkward handshake with next week - said that torture "absolutely" works. This is an insane situation. We are moving backwards and humanitarian law is not being upheld. Torture is a crime under any circumstances, irrespective of whether one calls it "enhanced interrogation techniques" or something equally ridiculous. Perpetrators cannot continue to operate with immunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1715"> The most glaring case of top-down institutional torture in recent years is, sadly, one in which Ireland played a part by allowing the American military the use of Shannon Airport, yet no one has faced justice for the crimes surrounding the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions and the ICC refuses to carry out its function in this respect despite a wealth of evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1716"> In 2005, the Prime Minister of Malaysia appointed a war crimes commission to investigate, among other matters, crimes of torture. The former co-ordinator of the UN humanitarian programme in Iraq, Denis Halliday, was a member of the commission. The trial held in Kuala Lumpur heard harrowing witness accounts from victims of torture who suffered at the hands of US soldiers and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. The commission met many victims of torture who had been detained in the prisons of Bagram, Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo. These included Satar Jabar, the man in the now infamous photo of the tortured man in the hood.</p>
          <p eId="para_1717"> In May 2012, the commission found George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and their legal advisers, Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Jay Bybee and John Yoo, guilty of war crimes <i>in absentia</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_1718">Prime Minister Mahathir sent two volumes of compelling torture evidence to the International Criminal Court, ICC, in The Hague. The Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC in The Hague responded months later with a standard letter pointing out that the court did not consider itself "competent" in this matter. In June 2014 Halliday and other members of the Commission presented the same evidence to a joint Iraq hearing of members of the UK House of Lords and the House of Commons. So far there has not been an acknowledgement of the receipt of this material.</p>
          <p eId="para_1719"> We are looking at a situation where these legal tools, that are designed to level the playing field in the fight to uphold humanitarian justice, are being used very selectively, or being fought against when used against criminals from more powerful countries. Politicians love to speak about justice and peace, but when they, in their role as salespeople for the corporate sector, are confronted with war criminals and murderers they are silent. In Ireland we only have to look at our cosy relationship with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, UAE, and friends, and our complete silence about the atrocities in Yemen. The message is a very sad one, but it is very clear: murder, death and destruction are of no consequence when weighed against economic imperatives. Moral values, and ethical codes, are easily bought.</p>
          <p eId="para_1720"> It is precisely this backdrop of collusion on the part of the political class that necessitates the use of the universal jurisdiction mechanism. Under this law, cases could be brought to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, by civil society, and usually it has been done by victims, and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which are frequently the principal sources of evidence, or of witnesses that could establish responsibility for the crime alleged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1721"> Landmark universal jurisdiction cases, such as the opening of a prosecution against Augusto Pinochet in Spain and the request for his extradition from the United Kingdom, and a Belgian court's indictment and extradition request for former Chadian dictator Hissne Habre, have been initiated through complaints lodged by private parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1722"> In Spain, private petitions, which routinely face resistance by the prosecutorial authorities themselves, have been the driving force behind universal jurisdiction cases. In the Spanish system, petitioners lodge a popular action directly with an investigative judge. This judge determines whether there is sufficient evidence to open an investigation, and is empowered to order necessary steps to enable the investigation to proceed. Generally, in such a system, the investigative judge will rule whether there is sufficient evidence, once the investigation is completed, for the case to proceed to trial. This popular action procedure was the basis for the international arrest warrant in the Pinochet case; the indictment, prosecution and conviction in Spain of former Argentine military officer Adolfo Scilingo; and the successful extradition from Mexico of former Argentine military officer Manuel Cavallo. The latter were both charged with crimes against humanity. In France and Belgium, private petitioners have initiated almost all complaints. Belgium's two major criminal trials involving universal jurisdiction - both concerning participants in the Rwandan genocide - were the result of complaints lodged with prosecutors by civil society. The process is very similar to how the Spanish system works. A popular action informs an investigative judge of the case, irrespective of the wishes of the prosecutor. All cases lodged thus far under French universal jurisdiction laws have been brought by civil society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1723"> UK law used to permit private individuals to request an arrest warrant directly from a district judge in instances where the police fail to investigate an allegation that a crime has been committed. On 10 September 2005, based on evidence presented by a UK law firm acting on behalf of a Palestinian human rights NGO, Senior District Judge Timothy Workman issued the first ever warrant under the UK's Geneva Conventions Act 1957 against retired Israeli General Doron Almog. The warrant sought Almog's arrest for his alleged participation in grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions in Israeli occupied Gaza, where he had been a commander. Almog arrived at Heathrow Airport the following day, but did not disembark from his flight after he was informed of the existence of the warrant. He returned to Israel before the Metropolitan Police could execute the warrant. In an act of pitiful cowardice, both the UK Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary apologised to their Israeli counterparts concerning the incident, and efforts were made to change the law to preclude private parties from applying for arrest warrants in relation to international crimes. The law was eventually changed in 2011 under pressure from the Israeli Government. This kind of cowardice and collusion is one of the reasons the situation in Palestine is deteriorating. If the world looks away when the Israeli military bombs and murders hundreds of innocent women and children, if there is no consequence, no justice, for these recurring and grossly disproportionate air assaults on Palestinians, which, obscenely, the Israeli generals have taken to calling "mowing the lawn", what chance is there for peace? Every week Israeli forces unlawfully kill Palestinian civilians, including children, continue to detain thousands of Palestinians who oppose Israel's continuing military occupation and apartheid, and torture detainees with impunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1724"> There is no debate about the veracity of what I say, and there is no debate about these crimes. If the soldiers, military officials, and ministers that perpetrate these crimes set foot in Ireland they need to face justice, as they will not face justice where they operate. Without justice there will be no peace, but we in the West are trundling towards a world where, in the general discourse, peace means war, and justice is injustice. The original name given to the illegal wars of aggression against Afghanistan and Iraq was Operation Infinite Justice. The US military carpet bombed large areas of those countries, dropping white phosphorus on civilians, while politicians in here cheered them on and allowed Shannon to be used as a military base for this savagery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1725"> On 28 December 2014, US-led coalition airstrikes killed over 50 Syrian civilians in the town of AI-Bab close to the Turkish border. It was days before civil defence workers could dig out the victims' bodies. The civilians were labelled collateral damage and no one was held responsible. It was barely reported. Approximately a week later, the offices of <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> were attacked and over a dozen people killed. The world mourned, people held vigils, there was a march supposedly to defend freedom of expression. In the words of the <i>Guardian</i>'s Seumas Milne, the march:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1726">was led by serried ranks of warmongers and autocrats: from Nato war leaders and Israel's Binyamin Netanyahu, to Jordan's King Abdullah and Egypt's foreign minister, who between them have jailed, killed and flogged any number of journalists, while staging massacres and interventions that have left hundreds of thousands dead, bombing TV stations from Serbia to Afghanistan as they go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">Here in the Dáil, with blatant disregard for the existence of historical or current events, the Taoiseach said that the rally in Paris was an important display of unity and a rejection of the use of terror in the pursuit of political or religious goals. As I have said, the function of the tool of universal jurisdiction is to level the playing field for those looking for justice for crimes against humanity. In the current political climate, where leaders routinely describe a world that has scant connection to reality, the field is increasingly uneven, and justice ever more elusive. I hope that this Bill can aid in some way to redress the balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1728"> There are some problems with the Bill, which I would like to correct on the next Stage. I would like to change the interpretation section, which is section 1, as the list of crimes that fall under the category of crimes against humanity are well documented and provided for in existing legislation. I would like to amend the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act 2000 in order to provide for the retrospective application of the law against criminal acts, including torture. Sadly when this Act was introduced it did not cover criminal acts which took place before the commencement of the Act in 2000. Also, I would like to amend section 9(4) of the International Criminal Court Act 2006 in order to extend not just extraterritorial effect, but retrospective effect, to all the international crimes covered. There are a number of changes to be made to the Bill, which is far from perfect. We want to stimulate debate on the subject and would be more than happy to take the thoughts and recommendations of others on board. We do not have a closed mind about what others feel they can bring to the table to improve things. It is far from perfect. We have a problem in the way international justice is organised and structured and the UN Security Council has made a laughing stock of it all because the US, Russia and China are never indicted for anything because they can veto resolutions at the UN Security Council. To date the ICC has indicted 36 people, and every one of them is from Africa. Only two were convicted but it is a huge problem that we do not have the means or the will, although I know there is legislation in place which would let us address much of what I have said but we are not doing it. I would like to think that by bringing this Bill in and talking about it we can highlight the fact things are not the way they should be and we can think seriously about our role in this area.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Andrew Doyle)<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1729">I thank Deputy Wallace for bringing the Universal Jurisdiction of Human Rights Bill 2015 before the House for discussion. I am responding to him on behalf of the Tánaiste who, unfortunately, cannot be here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1730"> As the Deputy has outlined, the purpose of the Bill we are considering is to amend the International Criminal Court Act 2006 and the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act 2000 with a view to providing universal jurisdiction in respect of a number of crimes, namely, crimes against humanity, genocide, war crimes and torture; defining the crimes specified; and providing for the penalties to be imposed on a person being found guilty of the crimes specified. It is clear that the Bill arises from the Deputy's genuine concern that international crimes of the most serious nature should not go unpunished. The House cannot doubt Deputy Wallace's sincere motivation in introducing this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731"> The exercise of universal jurisdiction involves the prosecution by the State of a person in Ireland for a crime committed anywhere, regardless of that person's nationality. As it is an exception to the general principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states, it requires the sanction of international law. Article 29.8 of the Constitution limits the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction to "the generally recognised principles of international law". Under Irish law, universal jurisdiction may be exercised in respect of certain war crimes and torture. War crimes constituting grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions or other specified serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflict, as set out in Article 8.2 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, may be prosecuted under the International Criminal Court Act 2006. Torture, pursuant to the 1984 UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, may be prosecuted under the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act 2000. However, there is no international agreement on crimes against humanity or genocide. The 1948 Genocide Convention does not provide for the exercise of universal jurisdiction. As such, there is no rule of customary international law that provides for the exercise of universal jurisdiction in respect of these crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732"> The International Criminal Court Act 2006 already provides the basis for the prosecution in Ireland of crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. It provides definitions for those crimes and sets out the applicable jurisdiction regime in respect of each of the crimes and the applicable penalties. Equally, the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act 2000 provides the basis for the prosecution in Ireland of torture. It provides a definition for "torture" and sets out the applicable jurisdiction regime and the applicable penalties. The 2006 and 2000 Acts were enacted to ensure that Ireland could comply with its obligations upon becoming a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the 1984 UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1733"> The concerns underlying this Bill, which seeks to ensure that there should be no impunity regarding the serious crimes listed in it, are commonly shared. The international community, in adopting the Rome Statute in 1998, created the International Criminal Court to ensure that the most serious crimes of concern to the community as a whole do not go unpunished. Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means for bringing to justice those responsible for the most serious international crimes. With the exception of a referral by the UN Security Council, the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is limited to crimes committed by the nationals of states parties or committed on the territory of states parties. The criticisms that are made in connection with the International Criminal Court's failure to act in the case of atrocities in various parts of the world, such as Syria and Iraq, relate to the fact that the relevant states are not parties to the Rome Statute. Until adherence to the Rome Statute is universal, the jurisdiction of the court will be limited. Ireland and its EU partners are seeking to advance the universal reach of the court to this end by promoting the universal ratification of the Rome Statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1734"> I would like to address the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 defines crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. While the definition of "crimes against humanity" in this section is almost identical to that in the Rome Statute, it removes the definition of “gender” in sub-paragraph (h) of Article 7 of the statute and removes the necessity to have a link with another act within the definition of crimes against humanity or with any other crime within the jurisdiction of the court. For that reason, this proposal requires further examination. The definition of "war crimes" in this section of the Bill is limited to grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, rather than the broader definition provided for in Article 8 of the Rome Statute and in the International Criminal Court Act 2006. It appears that the effect of the Bill, if enacted as proposed, would be that a number of other war crimes committed during armed conflict of an international character listed in the Rome Statute would no longer be criminalised in Ireland. This would not be a desirable outcome and would not be consistent with the State’s approach in the 2006 Act, which was to create domestic crimes in respect of war crimes when committed during armed conflict of an international character.</p>
          <p eId="para_1735"> Section 2 proposes to amend section 7(1) of the International Criminal Court Act 2006 by substituting a new subsection providing for offences of "a crime against humanity, a war crime or genocide" committed by "any person, whatever their nationality and wherever in the world" the offence is committed. The section also proposes that a person convicted of such an offence will be "liable upon conviction to imprisonment for life".</p>
          <p eId="para_1736"> Section 3 amends section 2 of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000 by removing its express extraterritorial jurisdiction and expanding the offence of torture by removing the link between people other than public officials and public officials or people acting in an official capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1737"> Having considered the Bill, the Attorney General has advised that it appears to be unconstitutional for a number of reasons. In the context of section 2, Ireland currently provides for the offences of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes under section 7 of the International Criminal Court Act 2006. Under section 12 of that Act, we provide for extraterritorial jurisdiction for Irish nationals regarding offences on board Irish ships or aircraft, and in respect of war crimes constituting "grave breaches" of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the relevant additional protocol of 1977, and in accordance with Article 8.2 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. In the context of the 2006 Act, the Office of the Attorney General advised that there was a lack of sufficient evidence in generally-recognised principles of international law to support the application of universal jurisdiction to crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in general. The Attorney General's view is that it would be constitutionally unsafe to advise whether principles of international law have evolved to recognise universal jurisdiction to prosecute these crimes without performing a widespread and thorough review of international law to establish whether there is evidence of the application of universal jurisdiction to prosecute in international customary law. On a more general note, the amendment to section 7 of the Act of 2006 provided for in section 2 of this Bill fails to take account of a potential overlap or conflict with subsections 10 and 12 of the 2006 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1738"> With regard to section 3 of the Bill, Ireland currently provides for the offence of torture under section 2 of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000. The act of torture under this section must be committed by a public official, or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official. Ireland exercises extraterritorial jurisdiction for the offence of torture by expressly providing that the offence applies whether the act is committed within or outside the State. In addition, torture is included as a war crime in the context of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1739"> In that regard, it is capable of extra-territorial prosecution under the International Criminal Court Act 2006 in so far is it relates to international armed conflict. Certain elements of the act of torture can also be prosecuted under domestic criminal justice provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1740"> The express extra-territorial jurisdiction in section 2 of the 2000 Act has been removed in the Bill. Section 2(3), as proposed by the Bill, may be attempting to exert extra-territorial jurisdiction for the offences in subsections (1) and (2) but does not achieve this. As the offences would no longer be linked to acts of, or sponsored by, public officials, the application of extra-territoriality cannot be said to derive from the convention and would not therefore be part of our international law obligations in that regard. As such, by reference to the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the Attorney General believes the offences provided for by way of the amendments in section 2 of the Bill are constitutionally unsafe, as they could amount to interference with the sovereignty of another state, which is not sanctioned by international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1741"> The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is also of the view that it would be problematic to take universal jurisdiction in this way as it would not be consistent with the approach generally taken by other states and that it raises questions of international law. Without prejudice to the observations on constitutionality set out above, the Attorney General has advised that the Bill would require a considerable number of amendments to elevate it to a level that is legally safe and capable of withstanding challenge, and that it would also require amendments to ensure that it is consistent with the form of legislation on the Irish Statute Book. For the reasons set out, the Government is not in a position to support this Private Members' Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1742"> The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has asked me to inform Deputies that the first review conference on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court took place in Kampala, Uganda, in June 2010. The conference adopted amendments to the statute on the crime of aggression and war crimes, referred to as the Kampala amendments. With regard to the war crimes amendment, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that there are constitutional difficulties but no such difficulties have been identified with the Kampala amendment on the crime of aggression. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in discussion with the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to progressing ratification. I thank the Deputy and hope he will appreciate, as I have outlined, why the Government is not in a position to support this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1743">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Wallace as ucht an Bhille suimiúil seo, a bhaineann leis an dlí idirnáisiúnta agus coireanna in aghaidh na daonnachta, a chur chun cinn. Aontaím le cuid den Bhille, ach ní aontáim le gnéithe éagsúla eile de. Tá sé de cheart againn an t-ábhar tábhachtach seo a phlé sa Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1744"> I thank Deputy Wallace for introducing this Bill to the House and he has put before the House a very interesting topic. I am very happy to speak on it. For the purpose of preparing for this debate, I researched the issues in respect of international and domestic law with regard to armed conflicts. It is important to recognise at the outset that international justice is a relatively new phenomenon. There were examples in the aftermath of and during the First World War of trying to outlaw certain types of weaponry but it was not until the Second World War and particularly its aftermath that we had a strong development in international law, especially in respect of the protection of human rights. Two people deserve particular recognition and attention in respect of this. In the middle 1940s, an individual named Hersch Lauterpacht formulated the idea of crimes against humanity and they were prosecuted in the Nuremberg trials. Another individual, Mr. Raphael Lemkin, formulated the idea of a crime of genocide. It was a very controversial crime at the time as it was seen as identifying and picking out particular groups of individuals. It was also prosecuted at Nuremberg. It is not surprising that crimes against humanity and genocide became such a recognised issue in the aftermath of the Second World War, particularly in light of the heinous deeds done to the Jewish population of Europe by the Third Reich during that war.</p>
          <p eId="para_1745"> I am pleased to say that much of the detail contained in Deputy Wallace's Bill is already part of our domestic and international law. With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I will examine the basis of the new provisions that Deputy Wallace seeks to introduce. I see from the head note of the Bill that one of the objectives is to ensure people can be charged and convicted for breaches of international human rights laws in cases of genocide, war crimes, torture and crimes against humanity, whether these breaches have occurred inside or outside the State. It is important at the outset to note there is jurisdiction in this country to prosecute individuals who have committed crimes against humanity, genocide or war crimes, even if those crimes are committed outside this jurisdiction. That is provided for in the 2006 Act referred to by the Minister of State, and there is also legislation from 2000 dealing with torture. I will speak to that presently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1746"> In section 1, Deputy Wallace's Bill sets out interpretations and it is important to note his interpretations are consistent with the law as it exists in this country and internationally. In section 1 he provides a definition for crimes against humanity that is identical to the definition contained in Article 7 of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court, which was signed on 17 July 1998. I note the Minister of State indicated there may be some slight divergence from that but my assessment is that it is generally identical to that definition. That definition of crimes against humanity was incorporated into our domestic law by section 6 of the International Criminal Court Act 2006. The next part of the section is Deputy Wallace's definition of genocide, which he refers to as being an act coming within the genocide convention. His definition replicates exactly the definition of genocide contained in the genocide convention and which is restated in Article 6 of the Rome Statute. It has already been incorporated into our domestic law by section 6 of the 2006 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1747"> The next part of the Bill is a definition of torture. The Minister of State has said there may be some divergence but it is virtually identical to the definition of torture we have in the 2000 criminal justice torture Act. That definition of torture is also incorporated into our domestic law by that Act. There is also a definition of war crimes, which is generally based on Article 8 of the Rome Statute, which has been incorporated into our domestic law by section 6 of the 2006 Act. There is therefore nothing objectionable in section 1 of Deputy Wallace's Bill as it merely reasserts the domestic and international law in respect of definitions of crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture and genocide as they currently exist in Irish and international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1748"> Section 2 of the Bill is slightly problematic. It is important to examine the proposed changes. Section 2 proposes to amend section 7 of the 2006 Act by substituting a new subsection (1). There are only parts of subsection (1) that see additions. As it exists, the Act reads that any person who commits a crime against humanity, a war crime or a genocide is guilty of an offence. Later subsections identify the penalties, with life imprisonment being the maximum that can be imposed. Deputy Wallace wishes to include in the definition that any person, regardless of nationality or place in the world, can be held liable for these offences. We need to consider this in closer detail. In the legislation as it exists in the 2006 Act, Part 2 deals with what is referred to as the "domestic jurisdiction" in International Criminal Court offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1749">This means Ireland has domestic jurisdiction in respect of certain offences as they exist at present. Under this jurisdiction, we have an entitlement to prosecute people in Ireland for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes which were committed elsewhere and overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1750"> Section 8 of the existing Bill talks about ancillary crimes. Section 9 recognises that it is the function of the DPP to decide whether there should be a prosecution. What we cannot have in this, or any other, country is politicians or other individuals deciding who to prosecute based on their own political allegiances or prejudices. Most importantly, section 12 recognises the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Irish courts. While I may be wrong with this, my fear is that the use of the words "wherever in the world" in Deputy Wallace's amendment would have the effect that people could be prosecuted <i>in absentia</i>. In some countries, it is permitted for individuals who are not before the courts to be prosecuted based on evidence against them. Any law that is introduced must be introduced on an objective basis. The principle of prosecuting a person <i>in absentia</i> is alien to the Irish criminal system and probably conflicts with the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1751"> People who are exposed to the prospect of life imprisonment should be entitled to ensure they get a fair trial. Trials of people <i>in absentia</i> are not fair trials unless there is an overriding explanation as to why they are taking place. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contains a long list of procedural guarantees, one of which is that an accused shall be entitled to be tried in his or her presence. There have been examples in the past in which people have been prosecuted for offences <i>in absentia</i>. I would be concerned about introducing it into Irish law. Although that may not be Deputy Wallace's intention, I am concerned that, as it is drafted, it could have this effect. It would be very unfair, given that we have provisions in our European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 that set out safeguards for people who are extradited to countries having been convicted <i>in absentia</i>. It would be very unfair if one could be convicted <i>in absentia</i> in this country while no guidelines were set out for one's protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1752"> I am slightly concerned that by having a system whereby we prosecute people for offences committed abroad when they are not here we may be taking on too much. We have many issues in Ireland that require to be investigated and that require the scrutiny of our statutory authorities. We can just about keep on top of the issues in our own country by way of inquiries without seeking to extend our tentacles abroad. We are not such a moral oasis that we will be able to deal with every problem the world is faced with.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1753">It is the end of a heavy week and we are here later than usual on a Thursday evening before the recess. That said, in many ways we are the lucky ones to have the luxury and ability to stand here and discuss critically important global issues of accountability and justice. While I can relate to Deputy Jim O’Callaghan's closing remarks about our problems here at home, defending international human rights is never a luxury and if there is anything we can do to elevate our position in playing our part on the world stage, we should strive to do it. This is what Deputy Mick Wallace is attempting to do. Having the power to do something and exercising the power are often two completely different things. By debating the Bill, we are elevating the necessity of legislation that we have to be exercised in order to deliver justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1754"> In 2001, a case was lodged in a Belgian court charging former Israeli defence minister and Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, and former Israel Defense Force, IDF, general Amos Yaron, as well as other Israelis and Lebanese with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide relating to the massacres committed between 16 and 18 September 1982 in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut. According to an Israeli commission of inquiry, Ariel Sharon bore personal responsibility for the massacre. It was he who decided the Phalangist militia should be sent into the camps, despite the risk that there would be a massacre of the civilian population. Official figures are that 700 to 800 people died, while many people say the figures were as high as 3,500 including children, pregnant women and elderly people. Bodies were mutilated and evidence has been shown to support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1755"> In February 1983, the Kahan commission, Israel's official commission of inquiry investigating the events, found that Ariel Sharon's disregard of the danger of a massacre was impossible to justify and recommended his dismissal as defence minister. Not only was he not dismissed, he went on to become Prime Minister and remained in power for many years. The Israeli authorities never conducted a criminal investigation to determine whether he, or other Israeli military officials, bore criminal responsibility. The word for that is "impunity", and that is what the Bill is striving to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1756"> In 2001, the survivors of the massacres brought a case in Belgium requesting that Ariel Sharon be prosecuted under Belgium's universal jurisdiction law. Political pressure from Israel and others led to the Belgian Parliament amending its law in April 2003 and repealing it altogether in August and to the highest court in Belgium dropping the case against him that September. Nonetheless, the fact that survivors of the massacre could try to hold to account somebody responsible after the home state had failed to do it - not just failed but rewarded the person - was incredibly important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1757"> Universal jurisdiction was codified in an international treaty for the first time more than half a century ago. The 1949 Geneva Convention on the laws of war provided that state parties must prosecute or extradite those suspected of war crimes. It was universal jurisdiction that enabled the state of Israel, in 1961, to prosecute the senior Nazi official Adolf Eichmann for his role in the Holocaust during the Second World War. During the past 15 years, a number of states including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK have started to apply universal jurisdiction legislation regarding war crimes, crimes against humanity, torture and genocide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1758"> If there is a weakness in the universal jurisdiction legislation, it is that political considerations can, and often do, override the universal and fundamental principles and the aims it attempts to uphold. That is why the Bill is being moved. This is precisely the arena in which Ireland, which punches well above its weight and has a high international standing and, at least on paper, our proclaimed neutrality, could play a role. Political considerations scuppered the efforts of the survivors of the Sabra and Shatila massacre to bring those responsible to trial for their crimes in Belgium. After a British court issued an arrest warrant under the universal jurisdiction for Israel's former foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, over war crimes allegedly committed in Gaza in 2009, the law was changed in Britain to prevent the embarrassment - that was the word used - of someone from a friendly state, in this case Israel, being called to account for suspected war crimes. It is embarrassing that people would use the word embarrassment in that scenario. It is perfectly justifiable that it would be attempted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1759"> It is a weakness of universal jurisdiction law that western states often do not want to bring their friends into the net. This does not mean it is not important or that we should not discuss it here. It is important as a deterrent, a symbol and a tool. We should use it. As Deputy Wallace said, the most famous use of universal jurisdiction was the attempt by the Spanish courts to prosecute Augusto Pinochet and extradite him from the UK to Spain for that purpose. It ultimately failed, not least thanks to the intervention of the then Home Secretary, an Iraq warmonger, Jack Straw, and despite the fact the House of Lords had ruled that Pinochet should face trial in Spain. The effort by the Spanish had significant ramifications. As a result of the precedent set, other leaders who have committed well documented crimes have been pursued, including former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who has had to cut his international travel diary, given that he is wanted in so many jurisdictions for trial or as a prosecution witness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1760">We know that cases have been initiated in Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, France and Spain against George Bush Senior and George Bush Junior for war crimes in Iraq, and against Donald Rumsfeld for war crimes and torture.</p>
          <p eId="para_1761"> Regardless of how those cases will actually end up, being empowered to take the cases is hugely important for the victims and it is a powerful tool. We should be looking at it a lot more. If one considers Israel as a case study, the impunity with which the Israeli authorities are operating and violating international law encourages those authorities to keep doing it. There have been three wars in Gaza since 2008. In the recent Operation Protective Edge, Israeli actions formed what has been called an undeniable pattern that suggested the crimes that had been committed by its forces in Gaza during the assault were actually the product of stated military policies or rules of engagement that enabled massacres, summary executions, wholesale residential destruction, the use of civilians as human shields and abductions. There was also apparent use of experimental weapons with deliberate targeting of medical facilities, journalists and so on. Thousands of people died in that assault, 3 million bullets were fired, which is two bullets for every person in Gaza. In a large part, during the wars in Gaza and the ongoing occupation of Palestine the Israeli weapons industry has trebled its profits. I do not have the time to deal with it here but there is the matter of a person having the benefit when going from a political life into a lobbying life for an arms industry. In taking on a lobbying role it is a benefit when one has the ability to say that the weapons he or she is selling have actually been field tested. It increases their marketability and the companies' share prices. We should be putting ourselves on the world stage to put a stop to this type of behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1762"> The Minister of State has said that we can already do many of the provisions Deputy Wallace seeks to bring in with this Bill. We, however, never do them. Why not? Passing this Bill would elevate the idea that Ireland might consider itself as an independent nation State with a bit of backbone that makes decisions for itself, and makes the decisions for international humankind. The weakness in the legislation - and in all legislation - is the political will to actually deliver upon it. The Minister of State has said that we all agree these things are horrible, and they are horrible, but we are not the people who are experiencing them now. We can, however, be the people who seek to try some of these matters on the international stage. We all agree the Bill needs a bit of work. Deputy Wallace would probably even agree to withdraw the Bill if the House agrees to exercise some of the legislation already in place and to initiate a few trials for a few of the war criminals. Presenting this Bill to the House is important for the debate and in elevating these issues. I believe we can work to improve the Bill if it is passed on Second Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_1766">I welcome the Minister of State. Sinn Féin welcomes the opportunity to speak on this Bill and we commend Deputy Mick Wallace for bringing it forward. We will of course be supporting it. This Bill, if passed, would enable the charging and conviction of persons who breach international human rights law in cases of genocide, war crimes, torture and crimes against humanity, whether these breaches have occurred inside or outside the State. As per the terms of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide Convention, the Bill provides a definition of crime against humanity, genocide, torture and war crimes, and it allows for the prosecution of persons whether or not they are public officials, to be prosecuted for these crimes in this jurisdiction. Universal jurisdiction, put simply, allows for the State to claim jurisdiction and to prosecute one of the listed crimes such as genocide or a war crime, regardless of where the crime was committed or the nationality of the accused or their residence. The rationale behind this is that such crimes are so serious there should be a universal method of addressing them. If something is a crime against humanity then humanity has jurisdiction. Further, the international community has a moral obligation to prosecute. Sinn Féin believes that sovereignty over justice policy and the judicial system is a cornerstone of national independence, one that was removed from the Six Counties by the British occupation and which was steadily eroded in the Twenty-six Counties through the incremental encroachment of EU control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1767">Sinn Féin fully supports international co-operation in the area of justice where this is necessary to fight crime and in particular the cross-border trafficking of drugs, and human beings, and in the interests of child protection. Sinn Féin also believes it is equally essential to safeguard the creation of further victims of human rights violations so such measures must be compatible with human rights security. Sinn Féin supports the enhancement of human rights globally and therefore it supports this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1768"> The State is currently party to a number of conventions that require universal jurisdiction such as the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, the International Criminal Court, ICC, and the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime. Although the principles of universal jurisdiction have been used for centuries to prosecute crimes such as piracy, it is only relatively recently that states have begun to apply the theory to grave violations of international law such as crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1769"> Other jurisdictions that already recognise universal jurisdiction are Australia, Canada, Belgium, France, Finland, Germany and Spain. That a state may investigate and prosecute very serious crimes committed outside its own jurisdiction is not a new idea. This concept was first codified in the Geneva Convention in 1949 and it was universal jurisdiction that enabled Israel to prosecute Adolf Eichmann for his role in the Holocaust during the Second World War. The vast majority of states recognise the validity of universal jurisdiction even though they may not have provided a domestic legislative framework for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1770"> Ideally, victims of serious crimes against humanity would find redress in the courts where the crimes were committed. The nature of these crimes, however, often means that this is not possible and universal jurisdiction acts as a safety net where the state is unable or unwilling to investigate or hold a trial. In effect, this reduces or has the potential to reduce, certain jurisdictions being used as a safe haven for war criminals. While some people may point to the existence of the International Criminal Court as demonstrating that there is no need universal jurisdiction, it should be recognised that the ICCs jurisdiction is limited. The Rome Statute has only been ratified by 110 state parties and its jurisdiction is limited to crimes committed after 1 July 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1771"> Sinn Féin recognises that there have been only a small number of prosecutions using universal jurisdictions where low or mid-level alleged perpetrators have had cases taken against them when they have sought refuge in states outside of where they have committed the crime. We also recognise that some people have criticised universal jurisdiction mechanisms, especially where there is the risk that it may be applied against them, such as Henry Kissinger. Plenty of critics came out of the woodwork to criticise the mechanism when Spain attempted to extradite Augusto Pinochet, which would have led to the implication of a number of other politicians. Ultimately we do not want to see perpetrators of crimes against humanity shielded from accountability for their actions. Dictators and despots commit atrocities such as genocide when they believe that they can get away with it and the concept of universal jurisdiction exists to try and end that. The global community must not accept that impunity is a legitimate alternative to the absence of universal jurisdiction. There should be no place to hide for war criminals. We have recognised that those who have perpetrated crimes against humanity in Bosnia and in Rwanda should be held to account. If we recognise this in principle, then there is no reason why we should not have a domestic legal framework to prosecute these crimes should it emerge that a war criminal has sought refuge on these shores.</p>
          <p eId="para_1772"> There are some who believe that universal jurisdiction interferes with the rights of domestic governments to decide how to address human rights abuses that have been perpetrated by individuals with the backing of the state. In response to this I would point out that Nelson Mandela agreed to grant abusers immunity from prosecution if they gave detailed testimony against their crimes. No prosecutor challenged this. Some may agree with this approach but it is important to note that this measure had the backing of the South African people and could not be considered to be providing those who had committed crimes against humanity with a place to hide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1773">In conclusion, I urge all Members to support this Bill in the interests of international justice and to demonstrate a commitment to the protection of human rights around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1774"> I commend Teachta Wallace for the huge work he has done in this area over many years in fighting for human rights, campaigning against rendition flights and working on a range of issues and campaigns. I support the Bill and do not see any reason that it cannot be progressed at least to Committee Stage. As Teachta Clare Daly said, if the Government is not minded to support this Bill, it should come up with alternatives on its own or demonstrate how existing domestic law is sufficient to make sure we have the type of protections for which Teachta Wallace and others have campaigned and will continue to campaign.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1775">I am grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution on the Universal Jurisdiction of Human Rights Bill 2015. I warmly commend my colleague, Deputy Mick Wallace, for bringing the Bill before us and for the enormous amount of work he has done on it and on related issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1776"> One of the fathers of international law is the great Jan Amos Komensky, known as Comenius, the Czech philosopher who made an important contribution in the early 17th century to advancing ideas on world peace and universal justice. He was writing about international peace and legal structures at a time when the German people were embroiled in the Thirty Years War, where at least 8 million Germans were slaughtered by different invading armies. At a time of desolation, he tried to get a prohibition on warfare and the creation of universal institutions of humanity. </p>
          <p eId="para_1777"> During my first two terms in this House, I strongly supported the setting up of the International Criminal Court, ICC. The House might remember it was the Radical Party of Italy which led that campaign and which regularly communicated with us here in Dáil Éireann in order to try to bring the idea forward in the mid and late 1990s, particularly in response to the incredible horrors we saw in the former Yugoslavia. The Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court was adopted by 120 states on 17 July 1998 but it was not until ratification in 2002 that the ICC became operational. It did not have retrospective jurisdiction and we have heard that a number of countries where atrocities have been committed are not participants in the statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1778"> The ICC has done some valuable work over the years in attempting to address the perpetrators of savage attacks on citizens and in pursuing mass murderers such as Radovan Karadzic of Bosnia, Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and General Ratko Mladic. Unfortunately, many observers think President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and other promoters of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans escaped the censure of the ICC for some of the reasons Deputies Wallace and Daly have outlined. To date, there have only been 23 cases before the ICC. It has issued just 29 arrest warrants and only eight persons have been detained in the detention centre of the ICC to appear before the court. According to the ICC website, 13 persons remain at large and charges have been dropped against three persons due to their deaths. ICC judges have issued nine summonses to appear and issued six verdicts. Therefore, there is obviously a platform but, at the moment, it is a platform which cannot really address the scale of horrors that humanity has witnessed in the past 40 to 50 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1779"> One of the issues, as the Ceann Comhairle would agree, is that the United Nations organisation has been kept so weak and marginal over the years, in particular by the powerful permanent members of the Security Council, especially the US, Russia and China. It is clear the mission of the UN should include the promotion of democracy and justice and a system of full accountability for leaders who inflict terrible harm on their citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1780"> While I have heard the Minister of State's comments on the 2006 Act, I believe the Bill before us will strengthen Ireland's participation in universal jurisdiction by amending section 7(1) of the 2006 Act. The narrow existing wording, "any person who commits genocide, a crime against humanity or a war crime is guilty of an offence", will be expanded to a much more comprehensive statement that, "any person, whatever their nationality and wherever in the world, who commits a crime against humanity, a war crime or genocide is guilty of an offence and is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for life by the State." As previous speakers have said, Ireland should take a prominent and leading role in pushing forward the concept of universal justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1781"> A notable example of the use of universal jurisdiction was when the Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzón, with the support of France, Belgium and Switzerland, indicted General Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile who overthrew the democratically elected Allende government. Judge Garzón looked for Pinochet's extradition from the UK where he was receiving medical treatment. Unfortunately, the UK authorities appeared to make sure he was found to be in ill health and the extradition and trial did not proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1782"> The Bill amends the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000 and the International Criminal Court Act 2006 retrospectively and provides for those who breach human rights law to be charged and convicted. I heard the discussion about the definition of crimes against humanity. I believe the suggested definition, namely, "when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack", is fairly comprehensive and it also includes murder, extermination, genocide, apartheid, torture, rape and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783"> In the past 100 years there has been a growing determination among international opinion to try to bring to justice those leaders and politicians who have committed massive violations of human rights. This concept was alluded to in President Woodrow Wilson's 14 points. Unfortunately, some of the democratic developments in the early 1920s, including the establishment of our State, turned towards a more murderous era in the 1930s and 1940s. The Nuremburg prosecutions and trials of the surviving Nazi leadership marked a first watershed in attempting to create an international legal order of accountability and justice. There are now a number of international treaties to ensure the further use of universal jurisdiction, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the 1973 Convention Against Apartheid and the 1984 Convention Against Torture, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_1784"> Human Rights Watch calls universal jurisdiction a "crucial tool by which victims of grave international crimes can obtain redress" and "an important means of reducing the unevenness in the landscape of international justice." Even since the Second World War, we have seen incredible instances of genocide, mass murder and other terrible crimes against humanity, including mass oppression in China, where the Tibetan and Uighur peoples had their national independence crushed, the appalling crimes committed in Vietnam, Laos and especially Cambodia under the Pol Pot regime, the mass slaughter of Indonesians of Chinese decent and the genocides and ethnic conflict in newly independent African states like Uganda, Rwanda, Igboland in Nigeria, Congo and currently in newly independent South Sudan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1785"> Of course, this is the point. Events like this are happening as we speak, with horrors being perpetrated where two factions battle it out and ordinary men, women and children suffer drastically in the process. There have been many other oppressive regimes and terrible conflicts, including crimes committed in apartheid South Africa, under the military dictatorships in Argentina and Chile, during the appalling carnage in former Yugoslavia and in the mayhem and mass murders during the past 15 years in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. These events have all cried out for accountability and justice. I note the points that have been made many times in this House by Deputies Wallace and Daly and others in regard to the sale of weapons to, for example, Saudi Arabia and the way those weapons have been used, as many would say, in a form of genocidal attack on the people of Yemen and in other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1786"> We watch the news and we are shocked and disgusted at happenings around the world but we then go back to our daily lives. Deputy Wallace has tried in this Bill not to make that response but to see if there is something, however small, that our proud, independent State can do about it. The United Nations needs to take a strengthened and proactive role against those who commit crimes against humanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1787">It is clearly in need of urgent reform and strengthening. In the opportunities the Ceann Comhairle might have available in various fora, I hope he will try to push forward reports such as the one from the European Parliament of March 2015 entitled, Reforming the United Nations: State of Play, Ways Forward, in which some of the elements are mentioned. This and other EU member states are the biggest financial supporters of the United Nations. We might have a much more responsive and accountable international order.</p>
          <p eId="para_1788"> At the end of 2016 a resolution was adopted by the UN General Assembly to establish a unit to undertake the investigation of serious crimes that had been committed since 2011 in Syria. The Syrian Government has consistently refused to comply with resolutions of the UN Security Council. Human Rights Watch, for one, states universal jurisdiction such as that being proposed in the House tonight should be used in Syria and that the International Criminal Court should be given a mandate to deal with the ongoing conflict and subsequent crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789"> I warmly welcome the Universal Jurisdiction of Human Rights Bill in the name of Deputy Mick Wallace. It offers hope there will be no hiding place for politicians and leaders who have led and promoted hateful crimes against their own citizens and humanity.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Andrew Doyle)<recordedTime time="2017-03-09T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1790">I am glad that I was given this shift to listen to what has been a very interesting debate. It is in the spirit of what the Irish people have stood for during the years. Whether one accepts that we are neutral, we have always sought to bring human rights issues to the fore and advocated across all continents for the education and empowerment of local peoples and communities, whether through our sometimes now maligned religious orders and missions, or NGOs. We have always had that spirit of trying to advocate for others. It stems from our past when we were suppressed. Education and liberty were things we had sought for many centuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1791"> I do not doubt the sincerity of the intentions of the Bill. I have taken on board what has been said, as have the officials of the Tánaiste's Department. We have to bear in mind, however, that we are bound by Article 29.8 of the Constitution which limits us in the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction to generally recognise the principles of international law. The Attorney General is of the opinion that the Bill may be unconstitutional in that context. I have gone through it before and do not propose to do so again, but there are a couple of points I will make. </p>
          <p eId="para_1792"> I cannot proclaim to be an expert, but there could be cases, hypothetical or not, in which an Irish national would be tried under this provision in another state and his or her extradition would be sought. Our first duty is to our own citizens and as such, we would have to ensure the bona fides of the trial or prosecution would stand up. As Deputy Jim O'Callaghan said, he has a wariness of trials <i>in absentia</i>. In the case of somebody to be tried for an international crime of the nature described in the proposed Bill and of such severity, in the first instance, he or she would have a right to defend himself or herself. In some states we could not guarantee the right of an Irish citizen to a fair trial. For balance, we have to bear that in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1793"> Deputy Thomas P. Broughan mentioned the UN Security Council. As far as I know, we are trying to become a member again to have a seat at the table. I represented the Government during the presentation of credentials by the ambassadors of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Fiji in Áras an Uachtaráin this day last week. President Michael D. Higgins asked for their support for Ireland's case. He was engaged in a little advocacy in the way we all know only he can do. The aim is to give Ireland a voice at the UN Security Council as a small nation with a history of showing concern for human rights across the globe. That is important. Against the big nations and the permanent representatives on the Council, it is important that small nations are listened to and also have representation on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1794"> My final point is not in the context of the Bill but is important regarding places of conflict. Not that long ago Syria was a safe haven for people from the Lebanon. Now it seems to be the other way around. Ireland's Defence Forces were part of UN peacekeeping missions in these countries. This had tragic consequences for some members of the Defence Forces which have always sought to bring peace to areas of conflict. There are courts - I am not saying they are all perfect - which deal with international war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. It is not perfect, but at the end of day we are bound by the Constitution. The Government's advice is that the Bill, as presented, is not constitutional. As a Government, we are duty bound to listen to the advice of the Attorney General.</p>

          <p eId="para_1795">I thank the Minister of State and everyone who spoke. First, I am very keen to find out if the Government would consider amending the Bill. I was the first to acknowledge that it was far from perfect. It was produced a couple of years ago with the help of a guy called Nick. We have a lot to learn about how to construct a Bill. It would be good if the Government actually sought to amend the Bill to make it fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1796"> In response to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's point, on which the Minister of State also picked up, about the dangers of holding trials <i>in absentia</i>, that is not one of the intentions of the Bill. If there was such a possibility, it could be addressed in the Bill. We want to create a situation where civil society groups or a civilian would be able to bring evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions to enable them to assess its worthiness to see if there was a genuine case to answer. If the Director of Public Prosecutions was to so find, a warrant could then be issued for the arrest of the person concerned. An Garda Síochána would be obliged to arrest him or her if he or she was ever to arrive here. There would be a trial, at which he or she would be present. He or she would not be tried <i>in absentia</i>. The case would be looked at <i>in absentia</i>, but the person concerned would not be tried <i>in absentia</i>. If there is a weakness in the Bill in that regard, I would be very happy to have it addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1797"> International law is very vague. Truth be told, we do not really have international law. It is not as strong as it should be. No war is pleasant. Wars are horrific and the Second World War was particularly horrific in terms of the number of people who suffered. In particular, what was done to the Jewish people was horrendous. There was a feeling at the time that it should never be allowed to happen again. Sadly, that feeling has not held. The plan was that international law would be established in such a way that countries would not be allowed to cause such terrible havoc again. Unfortunately, I can safely say there has never been a time when as many bombs have been dropped in the world. In the years since 2001 we have seen the greatest militarisation in the history of the planet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1798">It has led to untold destruction. As we know, over 60 million people are displaced today, mostly because of war. The number is growing. The world has become a less safe place. I would love to believe that Ireland could play a good role in this. I admit that many of the rules and regulations in our Bill are in place already. However, we all admit that we do not actually apply them. It would send out the right signal if Ireland were to enshrine a universal jurisdiction for human rights. It can be made to fit the Constitution. I would be happy to see the Government address the problems it sees in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1799"> I do not intend to get into a debate about it. We have had the argument about neutrality many times. Obviously, we have a different take from the Government on the matter. If, however, we wish to promote peace, the first thing we have to say is that we should not allow military aircraft, troops or arms through the island of Ireland in any form. That is really important. We should put an end to that. That, in itself, would be a wonderful signal of Ireland's intentions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1800"> There is no doubt but that Ireland has amazing potential. I do not believe we are neutral now. We were at one time but we have lost our neutrality. However, we can regain it — I am not without hope — and we can play a strong role in international affairs as a neutral country. We can argue for a more peaceful outcome to disputes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1801"> Is it not horrendous to think that in 2015, the then US President, Mr. Barack Obama, signed off on special operation forces to kill people in 135 countries? That is horrific. In 2016, the US dropped more than 26,000 bombs. The Russians have done some terrible things. The Chinese have done terrible things. Mr. Assad has done some terrible things in Syria. The Israelis are doing some terrible things, as are the Saudis. There are so many countries involved. Terrible things are happening in the world today. It would be wonderful if Ireland took a different position and said that under no circumstances would we support anyone carrying out any of these atrocities. We could say we are prepared to hold to account people who carry out atrocities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1802"> The Acts of 2000 and 2006 only dealt with atrocities committed after the relevant dates. Deputy Clare Daly referred to the things Henry Kissinger did. If he came here and we simply ignored the fact that he was responsible for thousands of deaths, it would be horrific. We should be able to hold someone like that to account. Other countries are doing it and there are countries to which Kissinger can no longer go. Why can we not do that?</p>
          <p eId="para_1803"> The sad reality is we are saying that money and power are greater and more significant to us than human rights, justice and peace. We need to think about that. We need to take a different approach. That is not what the people want. The people want to be neutral. They do not believe we should play a role in helping to promote war. However, we are doing that at present by allowing Shannon to be used and by staying silent about many of the atrocities in the world. We condemn some but not others. We should condemn everyone who commits atrocities regardless of what side they are on. We should bring ourselves to a place where people will know that someone who commits a war crime or a crime against humanity and who comes to Ireland may then be held accountable for it. That would be a great day.</p>
