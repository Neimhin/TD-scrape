#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.I am satisfied that there are satisfactory procedures and facilities in place in my Department for the preservation and archiving of all records, whether in electronic or paper form or otherwise.  My Department complies with the requirements of the National Archives Act 1986 which stipulates that all official records, regardless of their format, received or created by the Department of the Taoiseach must be preserved.Specifically with regard to the preservation of records held in electronic form, all members of staff in my Department are provided with the appropriate ICT facilities to create and manage these records as part of the Department's work support system.  All electronic records are stored on the Department's storage area network on which every individual staff member and every section is allocated space.  The storage area network is backed up nightly with incremental backups, weekly with full backups that are stored for one month, monthly with full backups that are stored for at least 12 months and annually with full backups that are stored indefinitely.Each staff member also has an individual e-mail file.  These are backed up and stored as above.  In addition, all e-mail messages in my Department are electronically stored using an e-mail archiving product that captures all e-mail messages into a secure e-mail archive.

He told us that he expected the comments in the Seanad of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, to be correct.  I brought to the attention of the Taoiseach at that time the fact that Minister of State had stated in the Seanad that documents held electronically will not be preserved.  I take it from what the Taoiseach is indicating today that what the Minister of State outlined is not the case.Is it now the case that electronic records will be preserved?  Does the Taoiseach agree they are just as important as written material that is traditionally preserved?  Will he indicate what has changed since his response and the comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh in February this year, and whether the position prior to that in February is now the case with regard to electronic material recorded prior to that date?  Is it a new development that preservation will be the order of the day or does it pertain to the beginning of the holding of electronic material?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Until the National Archives takes custody of my Department's records or alternative measures to ensure the preservation and accessibility of the records prior to eventual transfer to the National Archives, my Department will continue to retain electronic documents and records indefinitely.  The electronic records are held in my Department and there is sufficient storage to hold those records; until the National Archives Act comes into play for them and they are transferred, they will be held in my Department.The Department uses standard well-documented formats such as Microsoft Word and Excel, portable document formats and Lotus Notes for electronic documents and records.  Whenever system or database upgrades are performed, checks are carried out to ensure existing electronic documents and records remain accessible from the upgraded system or database.  It is also standard practice in my Department to convert data in older formats to more modern formats on an ongoing basis to preserve accessibility into the future.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	3	When I advised the Taoiseach of the comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh in the Seanad, stating that electronic documents would not be preserved, he indicated in reply that he was confident, knowing the Minister of State, that what he stated in the Seanad was correct.  Clearly, the Taoiseach's confidence was ill-placed if we are to take it that the reply is indicating that documents are being held as an interim measure until the National Archives is in a position to take the electronic material in trust for the State.  Will the Taoiseach indicate what point the preparation for holding electronic material by the National Archive is at and when he expects the transfer of records from his and other Departments?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I am not suggesting the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is incorrect.  No data has been archived to date as there is sufficient capacity on the storage area network to accommodate all electronic records in my Department.  Under the National Archives Act 1986, there is an obligation on Departments to preserve records created and received in the course of performing official functions, to seek authorisation from the director of the National Archives prior to destruction of any such records, and from among record holdings to transfer to the National Archives those records worthy of permanent preservation because of their ongoing value for administrative and historical research purposes when the records are 30 years old.  This is so they can be made available for public inspection and research use.That is the statutory obligation of the Department.  Based on the information I have given the Deputy, it is clear that we are recording the material in question in compliance with the National Archives Act.  It is not the case that one is obliged to transfer records to the national archives on an annual basis.  Records are transferred after 30 years and one transfers to the national archives those records worthy of permanent preservation.  That is the position.  Owing to the amount of storage on the storage area network, we are in a position to preserve all the records in question in the meantime.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The software used for archiving material in the National Archives is Microsoft Word 2007.  The problem appears to be that current electronic databases may become inaccessible in 30 years as a result of future changes in electronic data.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the electronic data currently being stored using this software will be accessible in the years ahead?The National Archives Act 1986 requires that a National Archives Advisory Council be appointed by the Taoiseach.  This matter needs to be attended to, particularly as the National Archives is struggling to cope with inadequate facilities and resources and, in some cases, very poor storage.  When does the Taoiseach expect to be in a position to appoint a National Archives Advisory Council, as intended in the legislation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	9	On the Deputy's second point, the National Archives Advisory Council was established to advise the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport on matters of archives under the 1986 Act.  My information is that it is the Minister's intention to reappoint the council shortly to advise on draft legislation.On the Deputy's first question, as I indicated in reply to an earlier question, whenever a system or database upgrade is performed checks are carried out to ensure existing electronic documents and records remain accessible from the upgraded system or database.  It is also standard practice in the Department to convert data in older formats to more up-to-date formats on an ongoing basis to preserve accessibility in future.  It is part of the upgrading process to ensure archives are transferred into the upgraded system.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Is it standard practice in all Departments to make arrangements for whatever archival material they have to be stored and made available as time goes on?I understand the Government proposes to merge the National Archives, National Library and Irish Manuscripts Commission into a single body.  When is the merger expected to take place?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I do not have before me information in respect of the questions asked, which relate to the archiving of documents in my office.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.The organisational review programme, ORP, was established to review the capacities of Government organisations in three key areas, namely, strategy, managing delivery and evaluation.  The aim is to ensure Government Departments and major offices are fit for purpose in terms of the challenges they face.The first report of the organisational review programme was published at the end of 2008 and covered three Departments, namely, Transport, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is now the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.The second report of the organisational review programme was published on 4 October and copies were circulated to all Deputies and Senators.  The report contains the findings of reviews of four Government organisations, namely, the Department of Health and Children, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Central Statistics Office and Property Registration Authority.  It includes follow up action plans prepared by the management of each of these organisations.  Detailed findings on each of the four organisations covering ten different organisational practices and behaviours were included in the report, along with a special commentary by the late Professor John Murray, head of the school of business, Trinity College.  There also is a chapter on ICT best practice guidelines drawing from research of the seven organisations reviewed in the first and second phases of the programme.While it would not be practical to go through each of the findings here, the second report highlights significant progress in several areas including, for example, a strong commitment to quality customer service being firmly embedded in many of the organisations reviewed, as well as a number of excellent examples of the effective use of ICT, involving innovative approaches and strong project management.  The report also highlights areas in which there are significant capacity challenges that will require transformational change and development.  For example, organisations still struggle to put in place effective performance measurement systems, especially to measure outcomes.  Moreover, people management must be significantly improved, particularly in respect of the flexible allocation and redeployment of staff and the introduction of innovative work practices.  In addition, Departments and offices must make more effective use of resources, both people and technology, to enhance productivity levels.  As for follow-up to the findings, a clear responsibility lies in the first instance with the head and senior management of each organisation reviewed to ensure full implementation of its action plans.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The report, which was published in October, was particularly critical of the Department of Health and Children.  It stated that the Department had not yet got to grips with managing the Health Service Executive, that allocation of staff was uneven and that staff morale within the Department was at a very low level.  It went on to state "the quality of leadership [within] the Department is uneven" and concluded that staff allocation was highly unbalanced.  What actions have been taken to improve the position within the Department of Health and Children arising from that report?  In the context of the decision taken to proceed with a voluntary redundancy scheme in the HSE, can the Taoiseach indicate whether a similar scheme was considered for the Department of Health and Children itself?  Has there been a marrying up of the issue of staff allocation and staff requirements in the HSE with that in the Department of Health and Children?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The danger is that we will get into detailed questions about individual Departments.  The Deputy is familiar with the normal advice in respect of the line Minister.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	15	However, this is a report of the organisational review programme, which is the responsibility of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach still has overall responsibility for the Government.  This was a report that was conducted under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach on various Departments and, as I am entitled to do, I am asking the Taoiseach a question about it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I always will be as helpful as I possibly can, however detailed the requirements.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The Taoiseach is being very open.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Thank you, Deputy.  Arising out of the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the action plan contains an action that is to take place by the end of the year to deliver a more effective allocation of work assignments, which will in turn lead to an improved use of available staff resources. The target is to have the work of the project team completed by the end of this year.  On the wider point, as the Deputy is aware, the Croke Park agreement provides the industrial relations framework to enable the Government, through redeployment, to consider a range of issues in which there are critical service pressures, to identify areas in which there is an underutilisation of staff and to make arrangements for redeployment in that regard as well.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	19	One point made in the report regarding the Department of Health and Children was that at junior level, some staff are overwhelmed with work while at the same time, staff in other areas have little or nothing to do.  Specifically, has that problem been resolved or when is such resolution likely?  When are the reports due for the other Departments that are subject to the organisational review programme?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	20	With regard to the Deputy's first matter, a project team is in place which will report by the end of the year on that specific point.  I believe it is No. 8 in the overall action plan.  That has been taken up as a matter of priority and urgency.With regard to the third phase of the review, four Departments are being examined in that respect.  They are the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Education and Skills, Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  I understand that substantive progress has been made.  I expect these reviews and the associated action plans to be completed in the new year.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The second report of the organisational review programme, also in reference to the Department of Health and Children, stated among its recommendations that the Department should:Define its customer and stakeholder groups clearly and align resources, processes and procedures to serve each one in the most appropriate way and at the same time strike an optimal balance in the allocation of resources between competing priorities.Has the Department implemented this recommendation?  Would the Taoiseach agree that speaking of the Department of Health and Children's role of service to the citizens of this State in terms of customer and stakeholder groups is inappropriate and reflective of the thinking that is influencing all that is wrong at the Department, where we have become customers or stakeholders rather than citizens with equal entitlements to access services on the basis of need rather than ability to pay?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the Department should consider all the people living in the State as meriting equally its concern and that services across the Department's responsibilities should be delivered in an equitable way, which currently is far from the case?  Have the recommendations contained in the second report, which I have referred to, been pursued?  Will the Taoiseach join me in urging a revisitation of the terminology used to describe the citizens of this State as customers, which we certainly are not?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	22	In fairness, I do not think that was the intent.  Customer service and customer delivery are part of the management of delivery.  There are three aspects to these operational review programmes.  These include the level of strategy in these Departments, how they are delivering and the situation for customers and people who use the service.  Of course citizens use the service.  No one is trying to say otherwise.  This is the terminology used in the organisational review.  It is not meant to devalue the importance of the service or the people who use it.  The reviews then evaluate how Departments are measuring performance, the feedback from stakeholders and from people who use the service and what is the input into policy and strategy that derives from that.As a management tool, a review is a good and objective exercise.  For it to be rigorous, robust and thorough, one would expect that there would be recommendations and that weaknesses and strengths would be identified.  It is like a SWOT exercise to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and to make sure an organisation responds to needs and to its strategy remit.Where resources are limited issues will arise and critical service pressures will emerge.  The programme is intended to get best practice across the system.  Service pressures may emerge in some areas which are not replicated elsewhere because there are different ways of dealing with these things.  In many respects it is down to management, personnel, the involvement of stakeholders and the team approach that can be adopted.  It is only fair to say that we are engaged in a huge change management programme regarding the delivery of health services, moving from a regional structure that was with us since the mid-1970s to one that is now based on a programme involving a national hospitals office.  This has been good and a means by which centres of excellence could be provided rather than looking at the need for resources regionally.We have seen what has happened in regard to the cancer care programme, which is a very good example of the sort of change management programme required.  These management programmes never meet with universal approval but outcomes for patients are far more likely to be better because of the changes than they would be under the status quo.  Sometimes defending the status quo can get people involved in loyalties to institutions rather than seeing the bigger picture of what is in the best interest of patients.  It is also about trying to localise as many services as possible and reconfiguring how we deliver them in a way that will, in many cases, increase service levels in many localities while developing centres of excellence in other areas.  That is how the hospital system is being reformed.  People have strong views on these matters.  I have outlined the overall thrust of developments.  Certainly, the status quo was not sustainable, nor was it providing the sorts of outcomes we would like to see.  There was certainly no uniformity of outcome, as one can see from various statistics.It is important that this exercise be about ensuring that, departmentally, the strategic plan of the health services is implemented by the bodies and agencies whose functions are on the operational side of the equation.  Despite the constant portrayal to the contrary, the existence of problems does not mean progress is not being made.  One can identify many areas in which objective progress is being made.  I am glad to say the experience of the health service of the vast majority of people has been good.  Members will note this themselves if they are prepared to admit it.  People confirm my point and have been very happy with the way their relatives, or others, have been catered for or cared for.  There are circumstances in which this may not be the case but, if one considers the overall level of activity, one will note that the thrust of the policy and the objective of the ongoing effort are to achieve uniformity across the service in every respect and on every occasion.  Against the background of limited resources, that is a continuing challenge.  The Croke Park agreement is a once-off opportunity to transform circumstances in a way that could provide us with a sustainable and practical future for stakeholders and citizens who use the service.  That is my honest opinion.Clarifying the roles of the Department vis-à-vis the agencies continues to comprise an area in respect of which further work is needed.  We are in the process of implementing a change management programme and when we come out the far side — it will not happen overnight but over a period — the basic thrust of and philosophy behind the changes will prove to have been correct and will best guarantee accessibility.  We have changes in respect of long-term care and care for the elderly, in respect of which there is now much more equity and a far better statutory basis for the equitable provision of such care than would have been the case in the past when various care systems grew almost organically and regionally depending on what resources were available and what practices were in place in various regional organisations.There have been many improvements but, as I would expect, particularly in a Department such as the Department of Health and Children in respect of the delivery of health services, there are areas for further improvement.There are significant areas where matters must improve further and in respect of which we must ensure that the strategy is implemented in the best possible way.  The redeployment provisions in the Croke Park agreement are fundamental to ensuring that we can allocate resources into communities, where appropriate, and that there is efficient use of the hospital system.

The second report of the organisational review programme was published in the first week of October.  Is there a timeframe regarding the implementation of the recommendations in the report, particularly those relating to the Department of Health and Children?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	24	A number of the recommendations in the report relate to the Department of Health and Children.  The action plans are set out and are part of the process.  The specific issue regarding a better allocation of work and assignments within the Department of Health and Children is a matter of priority and the recommendation in this regard has been taken very seriously.  I expect that the project team will have completed the work designed to improve the situation by the end of the year.  In the context of encouraging greater clarity between the agencies, we also expect the relevant work to be completed by the end of the year.  I am not stating that all of this work will be done by the end of the year but I am satisfied that several priority areas have been identified.  I am confident that what I have outlined will be done.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I understand the Department of Finance did not opt into an operational review programme at all and instead carried out its own capacity review in 2009.  The latter found that the Department is widely acknowledged to be a professional and effective organisation with dedicated and highly skilled staff.  Is there a reason the Department of Finance did not opt in?  Is it of such superior status that it did not need to be involved in an organisational review?  Is there a reason for its stance or was it a case of "Hands off, leave us alone"?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	26	As the Deputy is aware, an independent panel has been established to carry out a review.  It is usually the case that reviews ongoing in Departments involve existing personnel from other Departments coming in.  There is quite a fair level of engagement with the staff in respect of how organisational programmes are worked through.The Minister for Finance established an independent panel to review his Department.  His decision was announced on 10 September.  The panel is chaired by Mr. Rob Wright who has 35 years of economic, policy and management experience in the public service of Canada, more than 20 of which was at the level of what we could call Secretary General.  Most recently, Mr. Wright served as Deputy Minister of Finance in Canada.  The second member of the panel is Mr. Hans Borstlap, who has considerable experience in the Dutch public administration system, including holding the position of director general at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment and membership of the advisory board of the Dutch National Bank.  He also gained significant experience at EU level as Chairman of the Employment and Labour Market Committee.  He is currently a member of the Council of State and provides advice to the Government on the annual budget in this role.  The third member is Mr. John Malone, a former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Mr. Pat McArdle, an economist, provides support and assistance to the panel.  The panel is assisted in its work by a secretariat provided by the Department.The independent panel has been asked to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the systems, structures and processes relating to those elements of budgetary, economic, financial and public service management that are relevant to its role.  I expect it to report quite soon.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, together.The Hillsborough Agreement provided the basis for a significant step in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement by allowing the completion of the devolution of policing and justice powers.  The appointment of Mr. David Ford, MLA, a locally accountable justice Minister, was a further important landmark in consolidating the peace process.While justice is not a formally agreed area for North-South co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement, I am glad to say that the current excellent level of cross-Border co-operation in policing and justice matters is unprecedented.  Intergovernmental agreements on policing co-operation and on co-operation on criminal justice matters provide the framework for North-South co-operation in this area.  The Intergovernmental Agreement on Criminal Justice Co-operation provides for regular meetings between the justice Ministers, North and South, who receive reports from a working group made up of representatives from both jurisdictions, including senior Garda and PSNI officers and the heads of various criminal justice agencies.The Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has met with the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, Mr. David Ford, MLA, a number of times since the devolution of policing and justice and the two Ministers met again on 12 November to formally review ongoing co-operation.  The Government is also in ongoing contact with the British authorities in our joint efforts to combat the threat from so-called dissident groups.  The ongoing co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI will remain critical in tackling this threat.There are areas of agreed North-South co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement.  These include agriculture; education; transport; environment; waterways; social security-social welfare; tourism and relevant EU programmes; inland fisheries; aquaculture and marine matters; health; and urban and rural development.  There are regular meetings of Ministers, North and South, to review and progress areas of North-South co-operation in each of these sectors.The review group appointed under the St. Andrews Agreement was asked, as part of its terms of reference, to examine the case for additional bodies and areas of co-operation within the North-South Ministerial Council where mutual benefit would be derived.  At the last North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting in Dublin in July, the Council agreed that recommendations in a report prepared for the review group by an advisory panel of experts and advisers would be forwarded for views to Ministers who have responsibility for the North-South bodies.  They noted consultation that is under way within Executive Departments on the second and third terms of reference of the St. Andrews Agreement review and anticipated that the review group would move rapidly to conclude its work when this is complete.  Ministers agreed to consider the outcome of consultation that is under way in both jurisdictions at a future North-South Ministerial Council meeting.I would hope to see the St. Andrews review process brought to a conclusion in the near future.  I believe we need to move on to a more expansive agenda.  There is much potential for mutual benefit that can be realised within the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  We continue to make that point to our partners and we hope that, internally, the Executive can come forward with a review process that can be completed and allow us proceed.It should also be noted that at the twice yearly plenary meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, as well as considering issues across the agreed areas of co-operation, it is now regular practice to discuss the economic situation and to consider where co-operation could be to the mutual benefit of both jurisdictions.  I am firmly of the view that it makes sense for us to work together to achieve economies and efficiencies to mutual benefit, especially in the face of the economic challenges faced throughout the island.  As I have outlined, there is also ongoing co-operation in the justice area.  I look forward to continuing to work with my Northern colleagues to progress and develop North-South co-operation to the greatest extent possible.I am glad to note that the first ever North-South Parliamentary Forum conference took place in Newcastle, County Down, over two days on 7 and 8 October.  That conference was attended by representatives from all parties in the Oireachtas and Stormont and was co-chaired by the Speaker, Mr William Hay, and the Ceann Comhairle.  I understand that the conference followed a detailed work programme covering issues such as building parliamentary links with Europe and agriculture and rural development issues.  The Tánaiste and the British Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Nick Clegg, were guest speakers at the conference dinner.There will be a further North-South Consultative Conference on 8 December involving civil society from both North and South.I have not yet had an opportunity to meet with the new leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. Tom Elliott, MLA, but I sent him my congratulations on his election as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party.  I look forward to working with him and his colleagues for the mutual benefit of all those whom we represent, especially at this time of economic difficulty.I expect to meet with the North's First Minister, Peter Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, at the meeting of the British-Irish Council which will take place in the Isle of Man on 13 December.  I also expect to meet them at the next plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council which will take place in the coming weeks.  I sent my congratulations to First Minister Robinson and Deputy First Minister McGuinness on being awarded the Glencree Peace Award on 11 November in Dublin.  I was represented at the awards ceremony by the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche.

At that meeting, he highlighted the role of the six official North-South bodies, namely, Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, the Special European Union Programmes Body, the language body comprising Foras na Gaeilge and Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch, and the Foyle, Carlingford and Commissioners of Irish Lights.At its plenary session on 17 July, the North-South Ministerial Council agreed to take forward the review of the North-South implementation bodies and areas for co-operation as provided for in the St. Andrews Agreement.  Does the Taoiseach have any indication on when this report is expected?  Is there a cost for the 30 month review process that has taken place?  Is it the Taoiseach's opinion that the six bodies established at the beginning have fulfilled their remit?  Is there a need for them to continue in their original form?  Does he have any information from the review process as to where the future lies for them?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	31	As I stated, we are very anxious to move forward on all of these issues and the Government stands ready to do so.  The Executive in Northern Ireland is under the second and third requirements in the St. Andrews review.  It has to come forward with the internal outcome of that review process.  The prospect of getting some decisions at the North-South review is dependent on getting some agreement in the Executive as to what proposals it will make.I honestly believe this is a matter that should be progressed.  As I stated, we require the agreement of all concerned.  I believe the record of co-operation in areas where we have been able to proceed with co-operation has been to everyone's benefit.  There is a greater degree of potential in all of these arrangements and I believe that the level of trust and co-operation can and should be such as to regard expanding these areas of co-operation as being a matter of practical benefit and mutual benefit to all.  I hope these matters can be progressed as quickly as possible and we stand ready to do so.We attach importance to the provisions of the agreement, which foresaw an organic build-up of structures which will serve the people, North and South.  The issue with regard to the Commissioners of Irish Lights has not been resolved in terms of having an alternative implementation body in another area but what we have should not be regarded as either the beginning or the end of the matter.

This issue has been raised at a number of committees here, including the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and is a cause of serious concern.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the feasibility report that has been withheld contains recommendations for ever-deepening and further co-operation in health care delivery North-South that would make a critical difference for citizens on the island of Ireland in terms of accessing procedures that are not currently on offer on the island?  Citizens North and South must leave this island to access particular procedures, whereas if the mass of the population on the island was taken into account, it would allow for those procedures and the particular expertise to locate on the island of Ireland, at whatever location.There is also an issue with regard to particular areas, such as transplants, which are of a specialist nature.  Currently, people are obliged to leave this island for treatment.  The report contains many important and welcome recommendations.  Would the Taoiseach not accept that co-operation in health delivery systems is hugely important and would benefit all on the island of Ireland?  Will he join me in asking for the publication of this report and for its reintroduction as a document for live consideration North and South?

That said, the publication of the report requires the agreement of both sides.  We would like to see any assessments that are being made about how we can co-operate further, and pending any decisions that will be made to co-operate, we would like to see all of these avenues explored.  Where work is done, we would like to see it brought into the public domain as quickly as possible.

A key concern in this regard is to ensure that social welfare payments provide adequate income replacement and maintenance for the customer and their family, while also providing that sufficient incentive exists for persons to progress from the social welfare system to the workforce.  Return to work patterns are often a function of more than financial rewards and include such considerations as work availability, family commitments, travel to work time and the type of available employment.  However, financial incentives are important and these depend on the balance between the individual or family's disposable income when employed and when unemployed.The replacement rate for given income levels measures the proportion of out-of-work benefits received when unemployed against take home pay if in work.  While there is no predetermined level of replacement rate which would influence every individual's decision to work, clearly the higher the replacement rate, the lower the incentive to work.  In this context most literature on the subject of replacement rates works from the assumption that a replacement rate significantly in excess of 70% may be considered to be excessive, while a replacement rate significantly less than 70% may be considered inadequate.  In particular, high replacement rates are usually considered to be unsustainable in the absence of relevant and timely labour activation such as appropriate education, training or job placement measures and sanctions where claimants do not engage with activation processes.In July 2010 detailed analyses of the net incomes of 327,827 people on the live register, who received a payment for a full week of unemployment compared their social welfare income to the net incomes of typical household types in the workforce.  This demonstrated that the majority of social welfare recipients have replacement rates of less than 70%.  In particular, when measured against the national minimum wage, 91% of recipients have a rate of less than 70% and 9% have a rate of less than 80%.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseReceipt of rent allowance, or mortgage supplement, within the supplementary welfare scheme can have an adverse effect on replacement rates.  In this regard it may be noted that the purpose of the rent supplement scheme is, inter alia, to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation. Long-term accommodation support is provided through the rental accommodation scheme.  It is accepted that progress in relation to the scheme was initially slower than expected.  However the pace of delivery has improved significantly.  This will have a beneficial effect on work incentives as the rental accommodation scheme is neutral from a replacement rate perspective.  It should be noted that just 15% of the live register cases analysed in July were in receipt of either rent allowance or mortgage interest relief.In conclusion, I would reiterate that high replacement rates affect only a relatively small proportion of the social welfare population.  This is particularly the case for those people who are fully unemployed and in receipt of jobseekers' payments. For the vast majority taking a job will lead to significantly higher net income.

Irish small and medium enterprises confirm that even when they offer rates of as much as €15 per hour, they cannot compete with social welfare.At a time when 460,000 people are unemployed here, why did we offer 6,600 work permits this year to people from outside the EU?  Does the Minister agree with the comments by his colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, that it is acceptable to cut young people's social welfare payments or to allow them to do nixers?

Clearly I would not condone the practice.The replacement rates compared to the national minimum wage are 64% for a single person, 70% for a couple with one earner, 73% for a couple with one earner and one child and 76% for a couple with one earner and two children.  When compared to the average industrial wage, the replacement rate falls to 53% for a single person, 65% for a couple with one earner, 69% for a couple with one earner and one child and 72% for a couple with one earner and two children.I have heard a number of stories about individuals refusing offers of employment but I think several factors warrant serious examination.  If an individual earns an income he or she does not declare, the replacement rates are totally different, even presuming full employment and adherence to the law.  This is why I am keen to progress the national employment action programme at a much higher level than heretofore.  We have also enacted legislation which provides for sanctions to be imposed where an individual does not engage with that process.  Replacement rates are also affected by the rent supplement.

What is the Minister and his Department doing to encourage people to take up work rather than rely on State benefits?  People want to work but they are caught by the social welfare trap.  If they take poorly paid jobs, they will lose the medical card, rent allowance and other State benefits.  The media claim people are better off on social welfare than in low paying jobs.  I ask the Minister what he is doing about that issue.

The Deputy is making a contradiction in terms by asking me what I am doing.  The family income supplement exists to help people on low incomes and we should encourage them to take it up.  It would be preferable for the individuals concerned and for the State to pay family income supplement because it would make it more sustainable to those on a low income.I acknowledge that the medical card is the key to other benefits.  That issue has to be considered carefully.  I am also investigating the issue of people being unable to take up part-time work because three hours counts for a day's work.  We must examine atypical working patterns.  These complex issues are being considered by my Department.In respect of work permits, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation sets out strict guidelines.  I suggest the Deputy should put down a detailed question to that Department on the matter.  Work permits are not intended for positions which can be filled by the existing workforce.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	54	The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Currently more than 96,400 tenants benefit from rent supplement payments, an increase of 62% since the end of 2007.  More than 44,500 tenants have been in receipt of payments for 18 months or more.Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances after the payment of rent, less a minimum weekly contribution of €24 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.  Many recipients pay more than €24 a week towards their accommodation costs because they are also required to contribute a portion of any additional assessable means that they may have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate.The existing rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Those availing of part-time employment or training opportunities can continue to receive rent supplement subject to satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.Rent supplement is not payable where a person or his or her spouse or partner is in full-time employment, that is, 30 hours or more per week.  However, a person on rent supplement who is accepted as eligible for accommodation under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, may return to full-time work, subject to a means test, without losing entitlement to the rent supplement payment.  The use of 30 hours as the part-time work limit for the rent supplement is designed to be as advantageous as possible to individuals returning to the employment market without including those in full-time employment, thus reflecting the scheme's original purpose of a short-term income support payment.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseSupport for those in full-time employment and who require long-term housing support is provided by local authority housing initiatives which include RAS and other social housing placement schemes.  I have no plans to remove the 30 hour rule for the rent supplement scheme.I intend to keep the rent supplement scheme under review and my Department will work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long-term rent supplement while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.

There is a great deal of ill-informed discussion about people being better off on social welfare and I am concerned about the level of the debate in the media.  Forfás is also engaged in ill-informed talk.  The reality is that the majority of people are better off in work than on social welfare.  However, does the Minister accept that a particular category of welfare recipients are better off on social welfare, namely, those who face high housing costs?  For that reason, I ask him to give serious consideration to reform of the operation of the rent supplement scheme.  At present a ludicrous situation obtains whereby a married man with two children who is in receipt of rent supplement would lose €60 per week by taking up full-time employment.  That makes no sense.  It is a specific problem which relates to the operation of the rent supplement scheme.  Is the Minister prepared to take steps to reform rent supplement in order to make it worth that person's while?  If he was to remove the 30-hour rule, that person would gain €90 per week and there would be a very strong incentive to go to work.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Yes, I agree the scheme needs reform in a number of areas.  First, it was never intended to be a long-term scheme and, therefore, there are anomalies in that people are on it in the long term.  As the Deputy knows, one of the problems with the scheme is that the €24 is paid irrespective of the make-up of the household.  One will find people who are much better off on rent supplement than they would be, for example, in local authority housing, which should not be the case.  I have spoken to the Minister of State with responsibility for housing on this issue.  I believe it should once again become a time-limited scheme, which would deal with one of the traps to which the Deputy refers.The second issue one could examine is whether it is right that there would be a fixed payment irrespective of household income because, as the Deputy said, one gets crinkles as it is withdrawn.  I understand what the Deputy is suggesting in regard to the 30-hour rule.  We have already committed to considering this in the context of mortgage interest supplement.  I am open, subject to cost criteria, which is one of the issues, to looking at this whole issue because the scheme is not working for the purpose for which it was established.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Minister should be gone beyond the point of looking at it.  This is a critical aspect of the welfare system that works against people taking up employment.  It is clear that the 30-hour rule is the problem, as well as the withdrawal rate.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that he will tackle this problem in the upcoming budget?  It is key to removing the poverty trap and unemployment trap that exists.There are simple solutions.  If the 30-hour rule is removed, it means that for every family on rent supplement where a family member takes up a job, the State saves €19,000.  This is a win-win situation.  If the Minister applies himself to considering those key areas of reform, everybody stands to win out of this.  Will he give us an assurance he will tackle it in next month's budget?

I have had a number of meetings in regard to the rent supplement scheme.  I have met all of the relevant bodies and I will consider the suggestions the Deputy has made.  I have been considering suggestions such as that and I am working on a number of other issues in regard to the rent supplement scheme, one of which will be dealt with in the Bill we will be discussing this week, where, for example, we will be addressing the issue of the RSI number.  I am reforming the scheme.  Some issues are easier to deal with than others and I will move on all of these as speedily as possible.

The role of money advisers is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.There are 51 MABS companies providing money advice to clients operating from 65 locations around the country, as well as National Traveller MABS, which operates on a national basis.  In addition, MABS National Development Limited is funded by the Citizens Information Board to provide a national support and development service to local MABS companies.  The MABS national telephone helpline is available from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday to Friday, and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie.  Some 90% of clients presenting to MABS are assisted through the telephone helpline which provides assisted self-help to ensure clients take steps to assess and address their situations.  Last year, an additional 19 money advisers were recruited by MABS, bringing the number of MABS staff to 277.  The additional advisers have been appointed to MABS companies throughout the country.The money adviser works out a budget and negotiates on behalf of the client with all creditors, including financial institutions and sub-prime lenders, to secure better terms for the client in managing the repayment of their debts.  Where required by the client, the money adviser can assist with setting up a special account with a local credit union into which the client lodges an agreed amount of money regularly and from which each month the money adviser makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client.  It is important that people coping with debt difficulties take early action and approach MABS for help and guidance, which can be the first positive step for people in addressing debt difficulties.The Department was represented on the expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt, established by the Department of Finance and chaired by Mr. Hugh Cooney, which published its final report on 17 November 2010, with recommendations on measures to assist in dealing with the difficulties created by mortgage arrears.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The report recognises the valuable role of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service in providing information and advice to assist the increasing number of persons with debt problems, as well as its advocacy role in regard to dealing with indebtedness.Following the assignment of MABS to the Citizens Information Board, the structures and operational practices have been the subject of an ongoing review in the context of enhancing the service and enabling it to respond to the increases in demand.  In this regard, the Department and the Citizens Information Board will be considering the expert group report with a view to shaping the future role of MABS to address the recommendations contained therein.  In line with the package of measures recommended by the expert group, the Department's mortgage interest supplement scheme, which provides an invaluable safety net to mortgage borrowers, will be reformed to ensure its focus is aligned with the other measures being introduced.I am satisfied that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and the mortgage interest supplement scheme will continue to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.

The major problem people have is that, given the waiting lists, they cannot get appointments with MABS and must wait weeks, which creates another problem.  The Minister is correct that MABS is doing an excellent job through its interventions but more people are needed on the ground.  Staff should be transferred into MABS from other Departments.  Something must be done to deal with the waiting lists.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Within MABS, priority is given to those with very urgent cases.  Each company operates separately but I am more than aware of the need for people in extreme circumstances to receive urgent attention.The latest survey on waiting times shows that the average waiting time is approximately 4.9 weeks, with waiting times ranging from one week or less to some 18 weeks.  Urgent cases are prioritised and dealt with as quickly as possible.  The average waiting list has 42 people.This is why we appointed extra staff to MABS and it is important the assessments are put together.  It is also important that people would provide all of the required information.  In my experience of those with debt problems, information is sometimes given in dribs and drabs.  It is important that they provide all of the information so a holistic view can be taken of their problems.  We must do all we can to help people who have financial problems.I stress that financial problems are in no way confined to mortgage holders.  A very high percentage of those with debt problems are living in rented accommodation, therefore, it is simplistic to think the mortgage issue is the only aspect of this problem.  It is a new issue that has grown rapidly but it is by no means the only one.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently more than 96,400 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of 62% since the end of 2007.  More than 44,500 have been in payment for 18 months or more.  At the end of 2007 there were 32,123 rent supplement recipients who were in payment for 18 months and while the number decreased to 31,667 at the end of 2008 it increased again to 35,133 at the end of 2009.The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional social housing, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS.  Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show that a total of 30,008 transfers from rent supplement to local authorities have occurred since 2005: 16,696 rent supplement recipients to RAS and a further 13,312 recipients to other social housing options.It is accepted that progress on RAS was initially slower than expected.  However the pace of delivery has improved significantly.  In total, 14,000 recipients were transferred to RAS and social housing in 2008 and 2009; achieving targets set for RAS transfers for these years.  The target established for 2010 is for a further 8,000 rent supplement tenants to be provided with a housing solution by local authorities.In consultation with the Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has approved a number of pilot programmes in different local authorities to increase the flow of transfers.  These include allowing applicants for RAS to seek out their own properties which, subject to compliance with the normal conditions and the agreement of the landlord, may then be taken into the leasing programme.  Approved housing bodies under the leasing initiative have also been advised that they can source applicants for social housing support from long-term rent supplement tenancies also.The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is represented on a number of RAS implementation groups.  The purpose of these groups is to ensure that the RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long-term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role.

The Minister is correct.  We spend between €500 million and €600 million per year on rent allowance.  We also have NAMA — through which many thousands of houses are being paid for by the State and the taxpayer.  Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and whatever other agencies deal with NAMA, to try to make some of these houses available to people on rent allowance instead of having the State pay twice, for NAMA and for rent allowance?The Minister is also correct in regard to the RAS.  The local authorities have failed; there is no question about it.  They have failed to take people who are getting long-term rent supplement and put them on the RAS.  I agree with Deputy Shortall, whose point was correct.  There is an anomaly concerning rent allowance that needs to be dealt with in the coming budget in order to encourage people to take up a job on the basis that their rent allowance will not be affected.  We cannot have this situation continuing which is giving a bad name to people on rent allowance.

That is one solution.  The solution I put forward must be applied in conjunction with the Minister with responsibility for housing.  We need to reform all of this and rent supplement must again become a short-term scheme and any person who is likely to need long-term rental should be transferred to RAS urgently or at least approved for that scheme on an urgent basis.  That deals with the poverty trap

That would not change matters.  As the Deputy knows, NAMA transfers loans.  Only in cases where a receiver is appointed would NAMA be the actual owner of the property rather than the property being used as a security.  I have no problem, however, and I agree with the Deputy.  Obviously, if the State owns empty houses they should be filled.  That is a matter for discussion but as I understand it at present, there is not the handy answer the Deputy might think.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I must disagree with the Minister.  It is only when one walks the streets in Donegal, canvassing, that one sees the vacant estates all over the place.  NAMA has many vacant estates and we should seek a way to have such estates made available to the State which is already paying for themI have another question that I would like the Minister to take up with the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Finneran.  I believe that the Department of Social Protection should provide the funding for rent allowance but housing should be a matter for local authorities, not for the Department.  In my county alone, there are a number of vacant local authority houses which have not been used but, again, are being paid for by the taxpayer.  They should be used for rent allowance purposes and made available to people.  There are many hundreds of local authority houses.  The local authorities are not doing their job.  We have to save this money for the taxpayer and these houses should be taken up for use.  I ask the Minister to speak to his colleague, the Minister of State about this.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	81	That is more appropriate for the Minister of State with responsibility for housing.

The idea is worth exploring but I do not think there is a simple answer.  When a loan is transferred to NAMA it is the loan rather than the property that is transferred.  The property is the collateral.  Only in cases where NAMA moves in and the person whose loan is taken over has his or her assets appropriated would the State have direct control of the asset.  All these points are looked at on a continuing basis.Local authority houses provide the answer to this problem.  I fully accept the Deputy's points about filling local authority houses and people refusing housing.  We have to deal with that issue and it formed part of my discussions with the Minister of State.  A second issue is getting local authorities to move much faster on the RAS, putting people onto that scheme or approving people for it, thereby dealing effectively with the poverty trap mentioned by Deputy Shortall.

Employees are covered by PRSI classes A, E, H and P, which provide cover for the above benefits as well as for short-term contingencies such as jobseekers and illness benefits.  In 2008 there were 338,187 persons in PRSI class S.  In general, contributors get good value for money by paying for social insurance contributions.  PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments for self-employed people.  Self-employed people pay class S contributions at a rate of 3% per annum, a much lower rate compared to the 14.75% full class A contributions paid by employees and their employers, and this is reflected in the narrower range of benefits they receive.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.In this context it may be noted that self-employed workers generally achieve better value for money by paying social insurance compared to employees.  The 2005 actuarial review of the social insurance fund found that a male, married, self-employed contributor earning gross average industrial wages had a value for money index of 10.3 compared to an index of 3.1 for an equivalent employee.In basic terms this means that, with regard to benefits, the self-employed contributor can expect to receive over ten times what he contributes to the social insurance fund compared to the employee who only gets three times what he and his employer contribute despite the fact that the range of benefits available to employees is greater.There are no plans at present to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI class S contribution.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseSelf-employed workers who do not qualify for a social insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to social assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance, subject to a means test.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  A self-employed person's means are assessed in a flexible manner, taking account of the individual's particular situation and the overall economic circumstances.  As it is more difficult to predict exactly what level of income a self-employed person might earn in the coming year, their income and activity levels in the last 12 months are generally used as a guide to estimate their likely future earnings.  However it is not simply assumed that the previous year's earnings will be received in the coming year.It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes for example the loss of a contract or completion of same.If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for jobseeker's allowance, he or she can apply to have his or her means assessment reviewed in the light of the changed circumstances

There are currently 9,016 people categorised as self-employed receiving jobseeker's allowance.  The weekly average payment for this group is €206.  In addition, there are 10,580 farmers receiving farm assist with an average weekly income of €207.  However, I must warn the Deputy about those figures.  If a self-employed person has zero income because his or her self-employment has finished, such as a lorry driver who had a contract for hauling cement or blocks which finished completely and he or she had sold the lorry and had no income, then such a person would not be classed as self-employed under my statistics.

Some people who were self-employed give it up for many reasons and might decide they had enough income in the household to live on without being self-employed.  That is a personal choice.  It is very important that the social welfare code is a safety net for those whose income drops beneath a certain threshold.  One of the concerns I have had for a long time is the issue of self employed people who became unemployed.  Deputy Ring will know that for a long time I have believed the fairest system for the applicant and the State — if one is self-employed and allowed to have a self-employed income it is very hard to monitor it — is to offer work through activation.  When one gets busy again one will not be able to do both and in the meantime one is contributing to society through one's work.

It is recognised that the current downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.  If a self-employed person's situation changes after he or she has made an initial claim for jobseeker's allowance, he or she can apply to have his or her means assessment reviewed in the light of his or her changed circumstances.  There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI class S contribution.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	110	This is another area about which I asked the Minister to outline his plans for reform.  He recognises, as does everybody else, that there is a significant problem and yet is doing nothing about reforming the system.  There is a dispute about figures.  The Minister should have figures to give us a better picture of the situation.  The bottom line is that self-employed people get a very poor deal from the welfare system.  I am sure the Minister is aware, as are the rest of us, of many situations where people had no choice but to be self-employed over recent years because that has been the tendency in the employment market.Does the Minister accept that there are several different categories of people who had no choice but to be self-employed because of the abuse of the system which he was prepared to stand by over recent years?  People such as lorry drivers, for example, were classed as self-employed.  People who were small contractors, such as plasterers and carpenters, who previously worked for someone were forced to become self-employed.Like all of us, I am sure the Minister is aware that a great number of people only discovered they were not entitled to any assistance when they found themselves unemployed.  Such people are not entitled to anything if a partner has any kind of income.  Does the Minister have any plans to reform the welfare system for people who find themselves unemployed, having been self-employed?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	111	As I pointed out, in actuarial terms self-employed people, because they only pay 3% PRSI compared to 14.75%, come out much better in the long term because the most expensive benefit which everybody is paying for are pensions, be they State, contributory or widows pensions.  Therefore, if the system was reformed to give short term benefits there would be a number of practical difficulties and one would have to significantly increase the level of self-employed contributions to the approximate level of the employed contributions which is 14.75%.  One could not have a situation where one person was getting a lot of benefits, having contributed 14.75%, and another was getting an equal set of benefits, having contributed 3%.That is the dilemma in this case.  I accept there are challenges in this situation, as I said in my answer to the question asked by Deputy Timmins.  One very successful solution we found to the problem of self-employed people in receipt of farm assist was through the rural social scheme which gave one something akin to what a stamp would give one but it was done in such a way that the person was given time which reduced the possibility of abuse of the system.  I assure the Deputy that I am working in that direction and I hope to make progress in the near future.

I hope the Minister will introduce these reforms in next month's budget.  Is he prepared to give consideration to introducing a voluntary arrangement whereby self-employed people can pay the full stamp in order to give them the cover that is necessary in the event of them losing their employment?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	113	There are two issues.  The Deputy rightly referred to money.  The contribution would have to be 14.75%.  The other problem is that, for example, people in employment can receive payments such as short term illness benefit after three days even though they are not at work.  One is not allowed to receive the payment if one is attending one's place of work.If one is laid off work, one can immediately sign on for unemployment benefit.  It would be very difficult to monitor that in a self-employed situation and it would impose huge practical difficulties.  As I said in the reply, in most European countries, there are differences between self-employed and employed on that basis.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I have a simple question to which I know the answer but I would like the Minister to put it on the record.  Deputy Shortall referred to unemployed people who were self-employed.  There was a bit of confusion, in particular when the recession began, that these people could not apply for the jobseeker's allowance.  Will the Minister confirm that once they provide evidence of all their means, they will be entitled to jobseeker's allowance?  A number of people who were self-employed went to social welfare offices only to be told that because they were self-employed, they could not apply for jobseeker's allowance.  Will the Minister put on the record the position in regard to self-employed people applying for jobseeker's allowance?

I have answered numerous parliamentary questions on this but I am delighted to have an opportunity once again to clarify it.  A person whose income drops beneath the threshold of the family circumstances — for a single person over 25 years of age, that would be €196 — is immediately entitled to jobseeker's allowance.As a matter of form, the Department often asks for the previous year's accounts but that is only as a guide.  If a person had a contract to deliver bread, was self-employed and owned the van and the contract finished and a replacement contract was not put in place, the fact he or she had made a lot of money in the previous year would mean nothing because as long as he or she could satisfy the officials that he or she had no current income nor likely prospect of income in the immediate future, he or she could immediately get jobseeker's allowance.Time and again, we have reinforced this message and I am delighted to be able to do so again on the record.  We have also ensured that the officials in the Department are absolutely clear on the guidelines in this regard.  There is a safety net.

Earlier this year, the Taoiseach announced a number of changes to improve the delivery of employment, training and community services to the public by bringing together related responsibilities in these areas.  These changes included the restructuring of departmental responsibilities with the objective of providing a streamlined response to the income support and job search needs of people who are unemployed.In this context, my Department is devising proposals for the development of new initiatives which will offer social employment opportunities.  This new initiative will be an important element in the development and delivery of employment and community services and will aim to provide quality work opportunities to the unemployed and beneficial outcomes to the community.  A key feature of the new scheme will be to provide a new activation route that will support unemployed people in remaining job-ready for re-entry to employment as the economic environment improves.Referrals under these new initiatives will operate in tandem with the improved processes being developed under the national employment action plan.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	117	Last August the Minister announced 10,000 new scheme places but three months later not a single additional scheme place has been provided.  We heard much talk from the Minister throughout the year about various initiatives to help people access employment but, unfortunately, we have seen very little action.  When does the Minister intend to establish this promised scheme?  How does he propose to pay for it?  Can he give us an assurance that the scheme will be voluntary?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Work on the scheme is well advanced and I hope to be able to make an announcement on it in the near future.  I did not make an announcement on a scheme but I did an interview in which I indicated that I believed a scheme such as this should be developed.  I also indicated in the interview that it should provide 5,000 to 10,000 places initially.  As I said, I am working on it and we will announce the details in due course.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The Minister has had quite a bit of mileage out of this in recent months, that is, announcing various initiatives, including this one.  Let us see some action.  Can he put some meat on the bones of this?  How many places does he intend to provide?  We know that if one opens up new places on a voluntary basis, they will be hugely oversubscribed.  That is the reality.  The majority of people on jobseeker's benefit or allowance want to do something worthwhile.  If the Minister provides the places, people will fill them without any difficulty.  When does he intend to set up this new scheme?  How many places does he intend to provide on the scheme and how does he propose to pay for it?

An announcement will be made on the detail of the scheme in due course.The Deputy asked a parallel question about schemes being voluntary and so on.  I remind her that it is my intention to commence sections 18 to 20, inclusive, of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 on 1 January 2011.  The national employment action plan must have sanctions for people who say they are available for and are actively seeking work but who do not avail of appropriate courses or training and refuse to participate in programmes.

We are asking him about this promised scheme.  He is supposed to provide 10,000 places.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	124	That is not a point of order.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The Minister may not have announced the scheme but he leaked it to the media.  I do not know what the difference is and the media might explain it to us.  The media ran with it over the summer and I was inundated with requests to find out Fine Gael's view on it.  Deputy Shortall had the same problem.  When will we see people taking part in this scheme?  Will it be compulsory because, as I said previously, it would be wrong to take an accountant or an architect off the live register and have him or her sweep the streets.  That would not be acceptable as a way to remove people from social welfare.   Will the Minister confirm that will not happen?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	127	This will be operated through the national employment action plan.  As I pointed out to Deputy Shortall, it is intended to introduce sanctions provided for in law on 1 January 2011 to give teeth to the national employment action plan.  When the scheme is introduced — I have explained this in detail previously — the names of those willing to participate and co-operate with the national employment action plan will be put on a register for employment on the scheme.  Obviously, those who do not participate in the national employment action plan, which is an integral part of our approach, will be subject to sanctions.  That is the way it should be.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Like the other speakers, I understood the Minister was to introduce a scheme with 10,000 places.  It is very disappointing that has not happened because it is the way forward.The real reason I want to speak is to put the record straight in that many of those who were self-employed still have great difficulty getting social welfare.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	129	We have had two questions on that already.

The Deputy should give me specific incidents so I can prove that is not happening.  From my own work, I know that sometimes people do not give adequate information to my Department to make these decisions.  I would be more than willing to listen if the Deputy could give me specific incidents where people who have an entitlement to jobseeker's allowance are not getting it.  He knows I would be very concerned if that happened.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The Department's facilitators work with social welfare recipients of working age to promote economic participation and enhance social inclusion.  Recipients include people in receipt of jobseekers payments, people parenting alone, people in receipt of disability payments and people providing care.  Facilitators work with these social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that the individual has and ultimately improve employment chances as well as help them to continue to develop personally.  They develop individual progression plans with the customer.Facilitators operate within the Department's regional structure and are located throughout the country covering defined geographical areas.  They work closely with FÁS and other agencies at a local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development programmes for social welfare recipients of working age. The facilitator service is available to social welfare customers at all local offices.  Facilitators hold open clinics and meet with people who have been referred either by the social welfare local office, by other agencies or by local development groups.Appointments to see a facilitator can be made by contacting the social welfare local office or the facilitator directly.  In addition to this, cases are also selected centrally and referred to facilitators by the employment support section.  The service was enhanced under the national development plan social and economic participation programme, which provided for the provision of 70 job facilitators.  There are currently 67 facilitators serving which constitutes 65.4 full time equivalent posts.In the current economic climate the demand for the facilitator service is elevated.  Facilitators generally have scheduled days when they are available in different locations across our network of offices and people wishing to meet with a facilitator would be advised to call on one of those days, as a centralised appointment system is not maintained.  Accordingly, waiting times for individual facilitators are not maintained, although facilitators make every effort to contact all interested customers as quickly as possible.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	133	The Minister confirmed today that almost 440,000 people are unemployed.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	134	No, I dealt with that earlier.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	135	We will not get into it again unless the Minister wants to.  There are 67 people in place to deal with people who are unemployed, meaning each facilitator must deal with almost 7,000 people.  That is unacceptable.  Will the Minister provide more staff under the Croke Park agreement by moving people to this area?  People are unemployed and we must get them back into the workplace.  How will extra staff be used to deal with the issue, as it is unacceptable for each facilitator to have to deal with almost 7,000 unemployed people?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The Deputy knows that the employment services part of FÁS is being moved to the Department, so all the resources involved in placing people through FÁS will also now be part of a seamless service to be provided between facilitators and FÁS staff.  They will not do exactly the same work but all the personnel will work together coherently.  We could say that this is the Croke Park agreement working as we are bringing the FÁS services to the Department, meaning we will have the joint resources of what was FÁS in my Department in this regard.  When that happens, without adding extra cost burdens to the State there will be a much more efficient service.

This seems to be the weakest link currently, as unemployed people cannot get basic information about available training schemes.  Specifically, it seems there is nobody within the Department in a position to advise unemployed people about the implications if they move from welfare to work with regard to welfare payments, in-work supports, tax, PRSI and so on.  Will the Minister give an assurance that this will be made a priority and this kind of specific advice will be available to unemployed people, most of whom want to move from welfare to work?

I welcome the Deputy's support for this approach, which is fundamental to the changes made by the Taoiseach when he set up the Department of Social Protection.  We have moved rapidly and we are bringing in a second Social Welfare Bill.  We are quickly moving to the type of services that the Deputy wishes we could provide.  She should rest assured that there is nothing between us on this issue.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	142	In the past week we have seen the authority of and trust in this Government evaporate.  Having been told only last week that there was no need for any outside intervention or help with regard to a bailout, people have watched in horror as the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission arrived in Dublin.  Within three days the Taoiseach announced a formal application for a bailout.  Yesterday we saw the spectacle of the Taoiseach's absent friends withdrawing support from the Government on the basis that they had been betrayed and there was no proper communication within the Cabinet.  It seems, following the Taoiseach's press conference yesterday, that there is an ongoing attempt to cling to power at all costs.At this time of crisis what our country needs is confidence and stability; it currently has neither.  That is why people with money in banks are concerned about whether it should be left there because the budget might not get through.  It is very important to reiterate to those people that their money is safe.I assure the Taoiseach that my party will act constructively in the interest of Ireland with a view to stability and confidence required both here and internationally.  That is why we have a motion before the Dáil this evening that seeks to send a signal internationally about the importance of the 12.5% corporation tax rate, a fundamental cornerstone of foreign direct investment to our country.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	143	While I do not wish to interrupt Deputy Kenny, the time available for Leaders' Questions is limited.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	144	For this reason, I accept the Taoiseach's invitation to meet the delegation from the IMF, ECB and European Commission.  However, I will make one specific request to the Taoiseach.  He has within his grasp two dates which can restore certainty and a sense of confidence.  The first of these is the date of the budget.  The Taoiseach noted the importance of passing the budget.  The four year fiscal plan will be presented tomorrow.  The first year of the plan is, in effect, the budget for 2011.  In the interests of being constructive and of certainty, stability and confidence I ask the Taoiseach to indicate to the House that he will bring the budget forward to next week.  As he is aware from experience, a slimmed down version of the Finance Bill containing the key ingredients of the budget can be put through the House.  I will facilitate the Government by having the House sit from Monday to Friday in order that the legislative process can be completed by Christmas.  Such a step would bring some measure of certainty to a Government that is out of control.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	145	As I made clear yesterday, there is no question that the characterisation of clinging to office is my motivation.  That is not the case.  My sole motivation is to ensure that a four year plan is published, as agreed with the people with whom we are dealing, and that a budget is put to the House and passed.  The Minister for Finance has agreed a timeline for doing so with the Commissioner, Mr. Olli Rehn.  The Commissioner made it clear again today that while it is a matter for this House to decide when it does its budget, he does not want the process to drift into the new year.  I have explained that it is very important, in terms of meeting fiscal targets and getting full year effects of the plans we have in place, that we proceed with the budget on the day we have set out.  We want to do that properly and appropriately.  The timeline was agreed with the Commissioner when he came here to speak to the Minister for Finance.  The Government very much agrees that the best statement of confidence for this country is to pass the budget.  It is very important that this happens.While I do not wish to go over again some of the issues Deputy Kenny raised, unfortunately it is becoming something of an argument in terms of the political charge that has been made.  I want to make the position clear.  Last weekend, I refuted specific reports that were put to me and which were untrue at the time.  The first of these was the report that we had applied to join a facility.  I felt it was very important to confirm that this was not the case.  There were perhaps interests or people who felt that Ireland should make such an application immediately but I was very anxious to ensure that I represented the taxpayers and people of this country and that we made sure what would be the parameters of any discussion.In relation to the technical discussions that were taking place in preparation for the meeting on Tuesday night, we wanted to make sure that we were made aware of whatever concerns were being expressed and that our Minister attending the discussions could deal with them.  The political decision that was made on Tuesday night was to have a short, focused discussion with us in Dublin.  As Deputy Kenny is aware, this has moved along quickly.We must always confirm to each other that it is not the intention of any Government at any time to do anything other than represent the people of our country to the greatest extent possible.  I was simply responding truthfully to those specific reports, which were untrue at the time.We made a formal application on Sunday, having had the opportunity to set some parameters for the discussions, including as the Deputy noted, the importance of the 12.5% corporation tax rate as a cornerstone of our industrial policy.  It is important that people are clear in relation to some of these things — not specifically or uniquely about that matter but generally as we were proceeding with this issue.My second point is that it was unusual that a Government which had been pre-funded until July would have to consider applying for this facility, as we decided to do on Sunday.  It is clear, however, given the abnormality in the market situation and the perception or view of the G7 and of our EU partners and others, that it was important in terms of any instability in the euro area generally that we consider this matter on that basis.  We were prepared to do so because we are anxious to meet our international obligations.  However, we must also protect our own interests in the best way possible.  That is what I want to say on that matter.There is no intention or motivation on my part or on the part of anyone in the Government to mislead anybody.  While our room for manoeuvre was constrained or limited, what we were trying to do was to ensure we were not bounced into a situation.  We looked at the situation calmly, worked with colleagues, listened to concerns and made sure the parameters of the decisions we were about to take were consistent with what was best for the country in the circumstances.In relation to the other matter the Deputy raises, yesterday evening I set out clearly in a statement what are the Government's intentions.  A statement of confidence would be to pass the budget.  We will publish our four year plan, as we stated we would do, and submit it to the European Commission.  We will then bring forward whatever legislative enactments are necessary.  I do not wish to anticipate what these will be because some of them are budgetary matters but we will deal with these matters as promptly as possible to bring certainty to the situation for the financial year 2011.I reiterate what I made clear in my statement yesterday, namely, that there will be an opportunity for us to go to the country and have the country make a decision as to who should have a mandate to continue with the challenging work that faces the country in the years ahead.  However, the immediate priority — I know there are some who perhaps genuinely believe we should have an election at this time — is to pass the budget as we have said we will do.  Having set out the timeline for doing so, we need to proceed with it.  A €6 billion correction has to be brought forward.  That is the context and basis on which important discussions are ongoing regarding what will be the terms and conditions of the facility.  We need to continue to do this in as focused and calm a manner as possible.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	146	The Taoiseach used two important phrases.  He referred to the "immediate priority" and also to "certainty".  These are not normal times, this is not business as usual and I have no interest in attempting to play political games about something as serious for the people and country as the current situation.  I am not sure whether the absence of some of the Taoiseach's erstwhile friends from Cabinet means they have been sacked or are about to be sacked.  That is for the Taoiseach to decide.I do not accept that if one wants to bring certainty to this matter in respect of the budget, it cannot be done next week.  It was very easy for the Government to introduce a Bill overnight to take €1 billion from old age pensioners who were in nursing homes.  What is at stake here is certainty, stability and the confidence of our people.

Maybe the Taoiseach does not appreciate the level of absolute exasperation and anger out there.  One thing he can do is bring forward the budget next week.  He could also bring forward the essentials of the Finance Bill.  I will facilitate this if the Taoiseach so wishes by having the House sit from Monday until Friday for the two subsequent weeks to allow the Government to complete the legislative process.  That is a constructive proposal made in the interests of certainty, stability and restoring confidence both at home and abroad.What I do not want is to hear statements such as that made by the Minister for Transport today when he spoke of the Government going out——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	153	The point is the Minister for Transport was talking about having an election out in April or May.  Does the Taoiseach have any concept of the reaction this creates in respect of uncertainty?  I am stating, from my own experience here, that it is perfectly in order for the Government to bring in its budget next week.  It could bring in a slimmed-down version of the key essentials of the finance Bill and have that put through the legislative process, to which the Taoiseach correctly referred, in the Dáil and the Seanad and have it out of the way by Christmas.  That would restore some sense of stability, confidence and belief internationally that at long last, Ireland was beginning to move the way it should.I offer this proposal in the spirit of being constructive.  If the Taoiseach is serious about what he stated regarding the immediate priority and the restoration of certainty, I would support that.  Consequently, I offer the Taoiseach the opportunity to bring forward the budget and a slimmed-down key essential finance Bill and to deal with it before the House rises for Christmas.  The Taoiseach could then name the date for the general election towards the end of January.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I wish to make clear that I do not anticipate in any way the timeline Deputy Kenny suggests would be involved in completing the necessary legislative enactments to put into law the budgetary and other matters that must be complied with when the budget is announced.  Second, as the Deputy is aware, November is an important month for tax revenues and it is of critical importance to get right the end of November returns as one enters the next financial year to ensure one's budgetary assessment is correct and that the figures are up to date.  The Deputy also is aware this is the case.  Therefore, one introduces the budget within a week of those figures being brought through and incorporated.  This is the reason the budget always takes place at that time.  My point is that the Commission and the people with whom the Government is dealing accept the issuing of the four-year plan this week, as well as the holding of the budget on 7 December with the information that will ensure its qualitative and quantitative nature is correct, to be important and that the Government should do it in that way.Lest the Deputy think otherwise, I do not question his attempt or offer to be constructive.  However, he also is aware the Government must do this correctly and must get its end of November figures as part of its budgetary assessment.  Consequently, I am talking about having a budget to put before this House within the next two weeks and publishing a four-year plan tomorrow.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I wish to pursue this a bit further because we now are in a situation of considerable instability and lack of certainty.  This largely has been brought about by the Government itself.  The Taoiseach contributed to this last week when he continued to deny that discussions were taking place with the European Union and the IMF.  It ended up that the Governor of the Central Bank told Members on Thursday on radio what the Taoiseach should have told them earlier in the week.  It ended up that the IMF was brought in, with an application being made to the stabilisation fund on Sunday, which was something the Taoiseach had been denying all week.  All of this then was compounded by the decision of the Taoiseach's partners in government to withdraw from the Government, albeit not just yet, but with the caveat that they would remain on until the budgetary process was completed.The Taoiseach states that the budget must be passed.  One should be clear about this because strictly speaking, there is no such thing.  As the Taoiseach is aware, a process happens.  The budget is introduced, followed by a series of financial resolutions on the night of the budget.  Many of them deal with immediate matters such as excise duty, the price of petrol or cigarettes and so on and they often are not all that controversial as far as the House passing them is concerned.  However, this then is followed by two legislative items that are required to give effect to the budgetary measures.  The first is a social welfare Bill, which was passed before Christmas last year.  The second is a finance Bill, which I understand did not complete its way through the House last year until 25 March.I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  First, what is the timeline about which he is talking?  The Taoiseach should set out the steps for Members.  In his response to Deputy Kenny, the Taoiseach rejected his suggestion that the Government should bring forward the date of the budget, which is a proposition with which I agree.  However, the Taoiseach has rejected it and has stated that he is sticking with the date of 7 December.  What is the Taoiseach's timeline after 7 December?  In particular, when does he envisage the finance Bill being presented, voted on and enacted?  Second, since one party in government already has semi-detached itself from the Government and because I have heard statements from some Independent Members who have loyally supported the Government over the past three years that suggest such loyalty and continued support may be, at least, in doubt, does the Taoiseach consider that the Government has a sufficient majority to put through the financial resolutions of the budget on budget night itself, the social welfare Bill that will come after that and the finance Bill?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	156	As the Deputy has stated, I have given the reason to Deputy Kenny, which I reiterate to the Deputy, about the question of the end of November tax returns being an important part of the construction of any budget.  In particular, for a budget that is being devised in these circumstances, it certainly is important that this is the case.  This timeline is known to the Commission and the people with whom we are dealing and the Government will proceed on that basis.  My point is that it will be possible to do this far sooner than, for example, the suggestion that the Dáil be dissolved to be followed by an election, that subsequently there be a programme for Government, whoever might be involved in that, and that people would then take up office, prepare a budget, gain Government approval for it and bring it into the House.  All Members are aware that this would take a lot longer than the appointed budget date of 7 December.I also have made the point that the discussions that have been undertaken with the European Union and the institutions concerned both since the Government formally applied on Sunday and in the focused discussions since Thursday when they arrived here, are based on and in the context of the publication of a four-year plan this week and the ratification of a budget on 7 December.  This is an integral part of the process in which the Government has engaged.The third point to make to the Deputy is that while I do not wish to anticipate the legislative changes that will be required arising from the budget announcements for obvious reasons, he is correct that both a social welfare Bill and a finance Bill must be passed.  In addition, as the Deputy is aware, there is a need for an appropriations Bill in the normal way to ensure that payments can be made into the 2011 period.  In addition, any other legislative enactments that arise out of the budget announcements obviously also must be prepared, drafted, got ready and passed.  My point to the Deputy is that it is on the basis of fulfilling all of these requirements and giving certainty to the decisions which are taken and which are ratified by the House.  The Deputy then asked me what is that timeline.  While I do not have to hand the exact timeline, I assure the Deputy that it all will be done with due urgency and proper procedures, not in the normal way but as quickly as possible.  I am not in the business of using this situation for any personal regard for myself or any personal consideration for the Government.Moreover, on the question of the passing of the budget, I believe it has been stated, both in terms of external and internal confidence in the country, that the greatest statement of confidence we could make is to adopt such a budget with the correction of the magnitude of which the Government is speaking.  It is a matter of personal responsibility for all of us to decide if the country is to put through the budget or not.Of course, I recognise political differences between us on many issues.  I do not question — although it was questioned of me and never withdrawn — the motivation of people as they look to the national issue.  This is a matter of national importance to us all, for the country, for our future and for the future of everyone.  I am saying that openly.  We have to discharge our duty.  We will do that and we will come to the House with the budget.  I am hoping there are sufficient people in the House to see that it is in our national interest to ensure that the budget is passed.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	157	It is important that we have clarity and stability in budgetary matters and in the political life of the country.  However, the Taoiseach has brought anything but clarity to this matter in his replies, both to Deputy Kenny and to myself.It is not in the country's interest that the budgetary process be prolonged until the end of March.  It is not in our interest that we have a three to four month period of instability, doubt and lack of clarity as to whether or not the budget is to go through.  The budgetary process is not completed, as the Taoiseach knows, until the Finance Bill is enacted.  Last year, that was done at the end of March.I asked the Taoiseach his intention, with regard to the Finance Bill in particular.  I presume the other legislation, such as the Appropriation Bill, will be passed before Christmas.  Last year, the Social Welfare Bill was passed before Christmas.  It is not acceptable or in anybody's interest that the budgetary process be strung out for three or four months.  Uncertainty and instability for that length of time is not in the country's interest.  Deputy Kenny asked the Taoiseach if he would bring forward the date of the budget.  He declined to do so.  I ask him to tell us clearly when he sees the end of the process.  When does he envisage the Finance Bill being completed?My second question is the one I asked the Taoiseach earlier and to which he has not responded.  He has told the House a number of times that the constitutional responsibility for bringing forward and putting through a budget rests with the Government.  Given the announcement made by the Green Party yesterday and the statements made by some Independent Deputies, does the Taoiseach consider that he has a sufficient majority on his side of the House to put through the budget and the legislation that goes with it?

It is not because I am trying to be difficult.  There are valid reasons for that date.  It is also the earliest time a budget can be brought to the House, given all the circumstances we face.Deputy Gilmore's second point related to the timescale for the completed enactment of all the legislation needed arising from budgetary announcements, which I cannot anticipate or indicate to the House at this point.  I would expect that we should have everything completed in the month of February.  That would be my hope.

I am not playing games.  Deputy Gilmore has asked my opinion and I am giving it.  That is what I think is a realistic timescale for the legislative measures that have to be taken.  My view is that they will be completed in the month of February.  We will continue to work through these issues in the proper way.  It is important that we get this job done and that we focus on the budget to be brought forward.Finally, Deputy Gilmore asked if there would be support for the budget.  I believe there will.  The House knows and understands the situation.  I thank the leaders of the main Opposition Parties for the spirit in which this information was received.  Official advice and confirmation of the situation, in terms of the seriousness of what we need to do in the present situation, is available to both Opposition leaders.  I ask everyone to reflect on that and I thank everyone for the calm and considered manner in which we have had this discussion.

It is the effect of a decision by the Government to request assistance from the European Central Bank, the EU Commission and the International Monetary Fund.  The proposal that this would merit a mere 90 minutes debate in the Dáil is unbecoming to the Constitution and the people of Ireland.The Taoiseach himself needs to come to the House and explain in detail to the people what his Cabinet signed off on by way of a virtual meeting and videoconference of Finance Ministers.  Under the proposed arrangements, the Labour Party would have one 15 minute speaking slot and only the Minister for Finance would speak for the Government.  It is extraordinarily inappropriate and insulting to the people not to have the details of this decision explained in our Parliament.We are being told by every newspaper in the world what the Irish people need to do.  Everyone in this House is conscious of our international responsibilities and our responsibilities to the European Union.  However, under the Constitution we have a responsibility primarily to the citizens of our own country.  That starts with explaining this.  We object to a 90 minute debate as grotesque.

He will be aware that if returns are submitted manually, they must be received by the end of October and that if they are submitted by means of Revenue's on-line service, ROS, they must be received by 17 November.  As a result, the vast bulk of returns have already been received and will by now be known to the Department.As Deputy Tom Sheahan pointed out to me, there is a need for the Minister for Finance to issue a statement of reassurance to people who have money on deposit in banks, etc., to the effect that there is absolutely no danger to their money.  I accept that this has been done in the past but it is critical that the Minister should — with all the authority of which his office possessed — reiterate the position.Is it proposed to present the four-year plan to be published tomorrow in the House or will the Government again move to some outside location in order to engage in some sort of media spectacle?  The Dáil is the venue in which decisions must be made.

The Constitution provides for the arrangements whereby Ministers resign from Government.  Have the Green Ministers submitted resignations to the Taoiseach and have they indicated a date when they are resigning from Government?  Second, if they have not done so, does the Taoiseach intend to exercise his prerogative under the Constitution to request that they resign?

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	252	The Taoiseach gets well paid for it.  Get over it.

Can the Taoiseach tell us when first the engagements with these entities took place, how long have the long-denied engagements with the ECB, the European Commission and the IMF in the context of coming to an arrangement, now signalled over the course of the weekend gone by——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	267	These questions can be posed later. They are not appropriate for the Order of Business——

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	269	——and there will be provision to ask these questions later.

On the four-year plan to be published tomorrow, the arrangements have been indicated, but will there be a direct opportunity for address in the Dáil and will the Dáil have the chance to vote on the four-year plan?  Will there be a proper debate or are we only looking, once again, at a series of statements after statements?  Will there be a proper debate?  Will the Members of this House have the opportunity to pass judgment on the detail of that plan?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	271	First, on the earlier interaction, I want to make clear that I was asking the leader of the Labour Party to rein in the deputy leader, not in any other capacity.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I did not feel it was uncalled for given the fact that I am being constantly interrupted every time I get up to speak by his deputy leader.  It is a constant feature of Leaders' Questions, where there seems to be a facility for two of Deputy Gilmore's party members to speak whereas there is only one of ourselves.  It is a fair point to make, that Deputy Burton is constantly — it is not an intermittent matter — speaking, either over or during what I have to say.  I do not accord that disrespect or discourtesy to Deputy Gilmore or to any other leader in the House.  I listen attentively to everything that is being said but when I speak it seems everyone has licence to say what he or she wishes.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	277	——it gives Deputy Morgan a chance to catch his own breath.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I am not out of breath.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	283	——we are not going to have a lecture from the Deputy on this matter.  Will the Deputy resume her seat?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The Taoiseach is not going to rein me in.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I do not wish to engage in an issue.  I am making the point that I would hope that the same courtesy would be shown to me from time to time.  For whatever reason, a constant feature of the deputy leader's attendance at Leaders' Questions is to constantly interrupt.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	291	It is going to end soon, the Taoiseach need not worry.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	294	On the question on the debate in the House, of course, the four-year plan should and must be discussed here in the House.  The first instalment of that plan will be the budget and that will provide an opportunity for Deputies to vote on the plan because that will be the 2011 implementation of the plan.  It is upon its implementation that it will have its effects.  I look forward to a constructive discussion.  Of course, it will form the basis and the context for the budget and for the other discussions that are ongoing at present.

I will ask the simple question again: will we have the chance not only to debate but to vote on the four-year plan itself and not on any piecemeal exposé of it through the budget measures or anything else?  Will we have a proper debate and the opportunity to pass judgment by division?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The four-year plan will set out as a confidence-building measure in respect of the strategy that this and successive Governments will have to make on the adjustment of more than €15 billion.  People will be able to make their political choices, that have to be made on an annual budgetary basis, but the plan has to set out what the level of correction is and proceed from there.  The votes taken by the House on economic and financial policy in the country happen in the budget process with regard to the finance Bill and the decisions to be taken on Books of Estimates on an annual basis.  With regard to the plan, it is a plan that can be set out and debated in the House this week and next.

Given that I will not be in attendance at the National Conference Centre tomorrow because we are not invited as it is for the media, will the normal courtesy arrangements apply whereby we will receive an embargoed copy?  I suggest we do so by midnight tonight given that it is a four-year plan and it will require an amount of study.  If not, will the Taoiseach give us the time at which we will be given a copy of the plan?  Obviously, there is very strong international media interest and it is unwise of the Government not to give a copy of the plan——

We are not about to put forward a resolution to the House tomorrow for people to get consideration with regard to that.

The Government welcomes the decision of our European Union partners to provide assistance to Ireland, not only to address the banking and budgetary challenges we face but also to safeguard financial stability in the European Union and in the euro area.Before I deal with the substance of the matters before the House, I wish to reassure the House on one subject as requested by Deputy Kenny.  Earlier, Deputy Kenny sought reassurance that all deposits in Irish banks are secure.  All deposits in Irish banks are secure; they are secure because the Government guarantees them and because as part of the euro system, the European Central Bank ensures that the cash requirements of the Irish banking sector are met at all times.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I am responding to Deputy Noonan's party leader.  I am not aware of any particular difficulties; I am making this statement in response to a request by Deputy Noonan's party leader.  I have met this request, which was a reasonable request to make, and I am simply making clear what the position is.  The position is that the necessary cash is provided for the Irish banking system through the European Central Bank and is available.With regard to the question of European financial stability, we should always put these developments in context.  The ECOFIN Council decided in May 2010 on a package of European financial stability arrangements in conjunction with the IMF.  These are intended, if needed, to safeguard the financial stability of the EU and the euro area and to support member states in difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond their control.  The initiative for requesting this assistance, both from the European Union and the IMF, rests with the member state.  There is no arrangement whereby a member state can be invited by the European Commission or the European Central Bank to request such assistance.  A request under these facilities is a matter for decision by the Government in the member state concerned.As I told the House last Thursday, we agreed with our euro area colleagues at the eurogroup meeting on 16 November to hold a short and focused consultation between the Irish authorities and the Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  Its purpose was to determine the best way to provide any necessary support to address market risks, especially relating to the banking sector, in the context of the four-year budgetary plan and the upcoming budget.  This proved to be a very constructive and positive engagement and dialogue.  The Government then met on Sunday afternoon to consider the outcome of that engagement.  We agreed to request financial support from the European Union, the euro area member states and the IMF in the context of a joint EU-IMF programme.  The request for external assistance has been made under the terms of the European financial stabilisation mechanism, the European financial stability facility and the IMF assistance programme.As Deputies will be aware, this matter was discussed at the eurogroup meeting held by teleconference last Sunday.  However, the formal decisions were taken by the Ministers of all 27 member states at the ECOFIN meeting held later that evening, also by teleconference.  Following the meetings, a statement was issued by the eurogroup-ECOFIN Ministers welcoming the request of the Irish Government for financial assistance from the European Union and euro area member states and noting this assistance is warranted to safeguard financial stability in the European Union and in the euro area.The European Union and euro area financial support will be provided under a strong policy programme which is being negotiated with the Irish authorities by the Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the ECB.  This programme will address the budgetary challenges of the Irish economy in a decisive manner, building on the budgetary adjustment and comprehensive structural reforms that will be contained in the Government's four-year plan.  The eurogroup-ECOFIN statement, pointing to the strong fundamentals of the Irish economy, said that decisive implementation of the programme should allow a return to robust and sustainable growth, safeguarding economic and social cohesion.  The financial assistance programme may be supplemented by bilateral loans to be provided by EU member states.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden which stand ready to contribute bilateral loans.  I also welcome the statement of the Danish Prime Minister that Denmark will offer a loan having secured cross-party support.As the Government said in its statement issued last Sunday, a central element of the programme will also be to support further deep restructuring and the restoration of the long-term viability and financial health of the Irish banking system.  It will build on the extensive measures taken by Ireland to strengthen its banking sector via guarantees, recapitalisation and asset segregation.  These measures have helped to maintain financial stability in the Irish banking sector at a time when both the banking system and the economy have confronted significant challenges reflecting both domestic and international factors.  The EU Ministers noted that the programme will also include a fund for potential future capital needs of the Irish banking sector.  By building on the measures already taken by Ireland to address stress in its banking sector, a comprehensive range of measures, including deleveraging and restructuring of the banking sector, will contribute to ensuring that the banking system performs its role in the functioning of the economy.My Department, along with the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA, has commenced detailed discussions with a joint European Commission-IMF mission, with a view to finalising the details of the programme of financial assistance and associated policy actions.  This programme will build on the fiscal adjustment and structural reforms that will be put forward by the Government in the four-year plan to be published on Wednesday.  After approval by the Government, the programme will be endorsed by the ECOFIN Council and the eurogroup, in line with national procedures, on the basis of a Commission and ECB assessment.  The programme will also be endorsed by the IMF.  The negotiations have started in earnest and, while ongoing, will be completed as soon as possible.With regard to the budgetary challenges, the Government agreed to publish its four-year plan this week.  The strategy reaffirms our commitment to deliver a fiscal consolidation of €15 billion by 2014, of which €6 billion will be front-loaded in 2011.  This is on top of the €14.5 billion consolidation delivered by the Government since mid-2008.  By the end of 2011, we will have delivered approximately two thirds of the total consolidation over the period out to 2014.  The four-year plan will also include significant structural reform measures, which will help underpin and enhance growth in the years ahead.  It will also achieve the target of reducing the general Government deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014.  It will achieve this through a combination of expenditure reductions, tax increases, a renewed focus on growth and competitiveness, structural reform and public service transformation.I wish to emphasise that we have many positives at this time.  The underlying fiscal position has stabilised this year, with a deficit, excluding the effect of the promissory notes, below12%.  Our GDP will record a very small increase this year based on strong export growth.  Exports are expected to grow by about 6% in real terms this year, driven by improvements in competitiveness and a strengthening of international markets and conditions in the labour market are also beginning to stabilise.With regard to banking, clearly we along with the eurozone as a whole remain in very stormy financial waters.  Last week, the House agreed to extend the revised bank guarantee in accordance with the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank.  There is a broad European consensus for the need for the continuation of Ireland's banking guarantee.  As I have said repeatedly, had the bank guarantee not been introduced two years ago, we would not have an economy today, never mind a banking system.  The entire banking system faced collapse at the time, funding for it had all but dried up and the banks faced closure within days.  That is not an opinion, but a fact that was starkly illustrated in Governor Honohan's report.  Unfortunately, some commentators have chosen to ignore entirely Professor Honohan's conclusion and indeed sought to obscure it and confuse the position in the public's mind by relying on the criticisms that the Governor made to the scope of the guarantee, for example, the inclusion of dated subordinated debt.  I have responded to and addressed these points on many occasions.  Guarantees were a common feature in the response of many EU member states to the ongoing financial crisis.  We were the first to introduce a guarantee, but we were quickly followed by other member states in the European Union.  Recent figures from the European Commission indicate since the onset of the crisis in 2008, the Commission, under state aid rules, authorised some €3.6 trillion in guarantees in various member states.Last Thursday, I also took the opportunity to reiterate the State's commitment to safeguard the interests of depositors in Irish banks and this sentiment was shared with other members of the House.  This objective is shared by the eurogroup and supported by the European Commission, the ECB and all authorities with an interest in continuing to maintain the stability of the Irish banking system.  In that regard, it is important to point out to the House that the European Central Bank continues to meet the funding cash requirements of the banking system.  As the House will be aware, this scheme guarantees the security of all deposits in the participating institutions in the scheme, along with that of other bank liabilities guaranteed under it.  The extension of the guarantee has been approved by the European Commission and was endorsed by the European Central Bank on financial stability grounds.  Deposits are safe.  Nothing in the content of the discussions under way or anything that may arise thereafter will affect that fact.  The scheme complements the protection afforded to all depositors under the permanent deposit guarantee scheme.  Those that have funds and deposits in Irish banks can be assured that we have the stability and support of the ECB.  It is important that the structural problems that are identified in the market reactions are addressed in a systematic manner and that is what this intensification of engagement is about.With regard to the issue of a bank resolution regime, which was raised by Deputy Noonan last Thursday, I recently indicated in the House that I was examining options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal in a systematic way with distressed financial institutions.  This is to ensure the State has in place a range of tools to address problem institutions effectively in the interests of maintaining financial stability, minimising reliance on public money and ensuring continuity of key banking activities.  In view of the central role performed by central banks in resolution frameworks for financial institutions, the Department is consulting with the Central Bank to develop the necessary legislative proposals.  I expect that this process will lead to the introduction of an appropriate legislative framework for bank restructuring.The provision of financial assistance to Ireland is necessary not only to support our banking and budgetary situation, but also to safeguard financial stability in the European Union and in the euro area.  The European Union has acted in a spirit of solidarity with Ireland to ensure stability on behalf of its citizens.  We have challenges, but we have responded in a timely and appropriate manner to the challenges that have been presented.  I have already stated that we are now seeing the benefits in terms of a stabilisation of the public finances and renewed export-driven economic recovery.  The Government is grateful to our European partners for providing assistance at this difficult time.  Our strong underlying economic performance, combined with the fiscal correction and reform measures contained in the plan to be published tomorrow, will provide the foundation for recovery.  We will emerge from this programme as a vigorous economy and nation once more.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	318	Sunday night must have been the worst night for any Irish Cabinet since the Civil War.  It was an appalling situation where, after running our own affairs for so many years, the Minister for Finance had to go and plead with our colleagues in Europe to come to the assistance of this country.  Nobody on this side of the House had any part to play in the conditions which developed which required the intervention.  The intervention was totally as a result of actions taken by the Government and the Minister's attempts to resolve the situation over the past two years have only made matters worse.  He has become part of the problem rather than part of the solution.If our problems arose solely on the fiscal side, they would be difficult but manageable, despite the deficit of almost 12% between income and expenditure, and we could have addressed them ourselves by continuing down the path of fiscal correction which we started to take two years ago and in respect of which I complimented the Minister in the past.  The difficulty arises when the burden of bank restructuring is added to the fiscal problem.  That is the straw, the bale of straw or the lorry load of straw which broke the camel's back.  On Sunday night, it drove the Minister into the arms of his European colleagues and across the Atlantic to ask the IMF in Washington to come to our assistance.  That was a humiliating request for the Minister, the Cabinet and the country.  While his colleagues have not shown any sense of shame, I hope he is suitably embarrassed.It is difficult to know where we stand.  He has been chary in giving out essential details of the assistance we are receiving.  The management of the period preceding the request was extraordinary.  I cannot understand why Minister after Minister issued point blank denials about discussions, negotiations, talks or intentions to requesting the intervention of the European Commission, IMF or European Central Bank.  I do not know what kind of Cabinet has been operating if Ministers of long standing were not in the loop.  To put it bluntly, they were either lying through their teeth or they had not been briefed.  Given that it was certainly embarrassing to watch, it must have been excruciating for the people concerned.  The Minister should explain to the House what happened.  His Cabinet colleagues appeared to be hanging out with no information three or four days before he made the calls to his colleagues in Europe.  Contacts had been ongoing for several weeks and discussions were being held under his direction between officials from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the institutions concerned.

For policy reasons, the Labour Party found it could no longer continue but the issue was discussed openly among colleagues who were friendly with each other and arrangements were made for a withdrawal with the minimum of damage.  Everybody was in the loop.  Furthermore, when the Labour Party Deputies decided to go, they went.  This crowd decided to go but stayed.  One would send for security if it was a Christmas party.

The Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, did not know about it.  We are getting down to a very short list of misleaders and betrayers.  It seems to me they must have been referring to the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  How can they continue to have confidence in a Minister and a Taoiseach who allegedly misled and betrayed the Irish people?  They are still in Government, using their State bicycles and enjoying the perks of office.  There is still supposed to be collective responsibility.  It is an insult to the Constitution that the two Green Party Ministers continue to participate in Cabinet.  One is either in the Cabinet or one is out.  A Minister cannot have a leg in both camps.I was disappointed by the contribution by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Much of his speech involved a discourse on the process and a rehearsal of old ground, such as the bank guarantee and resolution legislation.  Certain questions have not been answered.

How much will be used to replace the money we would otherwise draw from the bond market to close the €19 billion gap in the running costs of the country?  Will it be used over three or four years and is it expected that we will return to the bond market?  How much will be needed for additional capitalisation of the banks?  What about the kind of backstop or confidence building fund that would encourage people to leave their deposits in the banks?  We hope that money will not be drawn down but its existence will give confidence to depositors.What are the terms and interest of the arrangement?  Somebody rang me this evening to suggest that we would face a penal interest rate of 7%.  I understood it would be around 5% but this gentleman seemed to know what he was talking about.  He advised me it would be a nine year arrangement rather then the three years I had expected.  He also described a peculiar arrangement whereby 30% of what was given would have to be put on deposit as a contribution to the backstop fund.  Is this fiction?  A lot of the rumours going the rounds are not true but other material is truthful.  The Minister is not doing himself a service by withholding the facts.  Rumours are always killed by fact but they will fly in their absence.  It is not a good idea to allow the continued circulation of rumours which should be either confirmed or contradicted.We need to know the proportional contribution of each of the three institutions.  Will the funds they contribute be in proportion to their respective sizes and will they go into an Irish fund or be assigned to different purposes?  It is difficult to understand why the terms are not set out in clear detail.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Even if the Minister told us that and told us what the negotiating position is, it would help.Talking about negotiating positions, who are the negotiators?  The Minister for Finance has primary responsibility but is it solely officials from his Department or is he assisted by people from the regulator's office and the Central Bank?  Is he bringing in consultants and are there any outside experts in the loop or any who have experience of the IMF?  Is the Minister confident his officials have the expertise to negotiate deals with these people?  That is not an offensive remark directed at the Minister's officials but they would not have had negotiations with the IMF before, whatever about having talks with the Commission or the European Central Bank.  It would be helpful if we knew that as well.I understand the legal position is that the IMF is required to draw up a memorandum of understanding with recipient nations when it gives them funds.  I also understand that a similar approach has been adopted by the euro fund in Berlin, which has €60 billion in capital at present, and it also requires a memorandum of understanding.  Will there be one or two?  Will there be an amalgamated memorandum of understanding or will there be two separate ones?  What are the review periods built into the memorandum of understanding?  Most importantly, it has been stated a number of times by Commissioner Olli Rehn and by various spokespersons for him that the advancement of funds is based on conditionality.  What are the primary conditions set down for the payment of these funds to Ireland?  While we will have questions later, that is my first run of questions.I do not want to labour the point.  It is a serious time and a serious situation.  We have been involved in the blame game for too long and it is time to get on to real solutions.  However, we need convincing that the Minister has a grip of the situation and that what he is proposing does not get us into greater difficulty.  In the past, the Minister made proposals here with great conviction and they have contributed to the problem rather than to the solution.

For an Irish Minister for Finance to have to go cap in hand on behalf of his Government to no less than three international bodies — the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund — must have been extremely difficult and distressing.I want to ask the Minister a number of questions about the proposals.  First, the Government has made great play in the past couple of weeks about opening the books to the Opposition.  However, it appears that one book the Opposition will not be able to open is the four-year plan.  The Taoiseach could not even confirm the normal courtesies of giving the Opposition a copy of the plan a couple of hours or the evening before the plan is published on an embargo basis.  While the media of the world will, I understand, be gathered in the new conference centre, perilously close to the ruins of the Anglo Irish Bank headquarters — is that off the agenda now——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	347	We have a perfectly serviceable and costly Department of Finance, which has facilities for press conferences.Will the Minister tell us at this point what is the amount of the loan, the assistance and the facilities he and the Government propose to seek?  We have need for money under three headings.  First, we need at least another €20 billion for the banks, and some would say perhaps €40 billion — the Minister would know more about that.  Second, we need money to cover the fiscal deficit.  As the ordinary Irish deficit — the difference between what we, as a country, spend and what we take in taxes — is reckoned to be somewhere between €18 billion and €20 billion, it is estimated that over the three years of the plan we will need €45 billion.  However, I have seen others estimate that it may be as much as €60 billion given the interest costs on our ever-growing debt, and the rate at which those interest costs are charged is increasing the deficit gap all the time.Third, a whole series of national Government debt which was sold ten years ago, five years ago and two years ago falls due in the normal course of events for rolling over the first three years of the loan.  I understand the amounts falling due for either payment or rollover in the next three years are significant.  Again, the Minister might advise us in this regard.  A lot of short-term debt was issued by the State in the past two and a half years because of the blanket bank guarantee.  I understand approximately €11 billion of that is falling due in the next three to four years, which clearly means the amount of the facility has to be large.The next point is the rate of interest.  Is the Government really negotiating or is this a technical exercise being carried out by officials in the Department of Finance, where there are observers present from the Central Bank and the NTMA, and where clearly the politicians of the Government are entirely distracted by the internal collapse of the Government and are not in a position to negotiate in any serious way?  That alone is a reason for an election.Finally, what is the term of the loan?  I understand most of these facilities are three-year money, which means, for example, if they are priced at 5.5%, although that sounds cheaper than ten-year money at 8% or 9%, it is in fact extremely expensive for three-year money.  In other words, the Irish people will be climbing a mountain, and as they climb the top of the mountain they will be going ever higher so we will not be able to get out of this for a very long period.This brings me to a number of issues that have been mentioned by Ministers and others in the context of the current crisis.  I am sick of hearing about the stress testing of banks.  It is a phrase I do not want to hear much of when this Dáil is through.  We have our old friend, the stress test — what one of the distinguished journalists used to call "Joo Diligence", which is another way of stress testing.  It does not matter any longer in the context of the current crisis what stress tests are done because our banks have burned our economy so much the international markets do not believe in them.  Somebody may buy them very cheaply.  Hedge funds, which are bottom feeders, may be picking up shares in Bank of Ireland and AIB today — who is to say?  However, they are bottom feeders and will be in and out as quickly as possible for their buck.  Yet, we seriously propose to have more stress tests.  If the capital ratio of Irish banks was raised to 12% or 14%, nobody on the markets would care.  Why?  It is because the contagion of the Irish banks has spread to the Irish sovereign through the disaster of the strategy of the blanket bank guarantee.The Minister suggested two and a quarter years ago, at the time of the guarantee, that the Irish banks were going to fail.  I remember at the time the Governor of the Central Bank and the regulator trotted in and out of committees in the basement of Leinster House to repeat, rather like a prayer to St. Jude, that the fundamentals were sound.The Minister tells us now, two and a quarter years later, the Irish banks were in meltdown.  However, at the time he said anything but that.  It is an interesting acknowledgment on his part——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I have a question for the Minister which is pertinent to Greece.  As I understand it, Greece is reviewed by the IMF team every quarter.  I spoke today with a person from Greece who is familiar with what the country is going through.  I understand that reviewing data every quarter is part of what the IMF does as its standard template.  The Minister made a distinction when he said the ECB and the European Commission would review Ireland only every year but the fact is the IMF does quarterly reviews.  That means that if a country does not meet the quarterly target, as in the case of Greece recently, the VAT rate is raised, as it was in Greece.    The Minister ought to clarify that point.Is it the Minister and his Government, rather than mandarins in the Department of Finance, who are negotiating a package and does it consist only of deflationary measures?  There is no economy in the world of which I am aware where such deflation has succeeded.  I include the great leap forward — or whatever it was called — practised at various times by the Soviet Union and China which consisted of primitive capital accumulation with the people in the country being allowed nothing while everything went into the superstructure, infrastructure and army of the state.  Those are the only examples in history and they were accompanied by terrible suffering in the societies in question.  How will the Minister deflate this economy back to recovery?  It has never been done in economic history.I say to our European allies that the Irish Labour Party is extremely conscious of its responsibility and of the benefits that membership of the European Union has brought to this country.  We are very proud to have been part of the European Union and to share in the many benefits membership has brought us.  However, Ireland is in a moment of peril, as an economy and as a country.  So, too, is Europe.  I do not know whether the Minister is any longer in a position to argue with his European colleagues against deflating Ireland to the point where the Irish economy would be killed for a great number of years, almost like a country paying tribute after a war.  That is not the road to recovery, for either Ireland or the European Union.  I do not know whether the Minister's Government is in a position, given its state of chaos and collapse and the clear and evident collapse of morale within it, not to mention the departure of the late lamented Green Party——

The interruption is not a problem.  I speak of our absent friends.  I do not know whether we are toasting them but let us note the absent friends.I do not know of an economy which has been deflated back to recovery.  This is a fundamental issue and there must be a debate about it.  The Irish Labour Party has made a proposal, modelled on what Germany did after the Second World War before the KFW, about which the Minister spoke, invested in derivatives.  There was a derogatory comment about that particular KFW banking group.  Given that we are all trying to get the country out of this situation it is better to recognise that the model of strategic investment bank in Germany after the war provided for investment in infrastructure and funding for small and medium businesses.  We need the same in Ireland, particularly for innovation and for tax sectors that are taking off.It is almost impossible for the Government to negotiate a deal given its political position.  However, even though we are in terrible difficulties, it is really important to get a deal that will enable Ireland to grow and recover.  That way we can pay the astonishing debts from the banks that have sunk us and we can give hope to the people that the country can and will recover.We have a very short period in which to debate this resolution and it is very important that the Minister should explain where exactly these negotiations stand and whether they are simply technical negotiations, the kind in which the Doctors No in the Department of Finance deal.  They have only two words; they say "No" to any expenditure and "Yes" to any cut.  That is the mindset of the Department of Finance but it is a technical mindset.  Perhaps that is what finance officials do, like secret policemen in every country in the world.  However, the job of politicians is to use the technical information to bring from difficult circumstances something that will give the people in the country hope and the expectation of growth.The extraordinary thing is that currently Irish people are saving.  They have savings in excess of €88 billion as they save and pay down their debts.  Some imagination would provide a mechanism to use some of those savings in a safe way in this country.  Most Irish people want to save and invest in their own country.  Very few want to be tax exiles.  Most of us live and work here, our children are here, our football teams are here — or most of them are and, if not, they are only a short distance away.We need imaginative ways in which to proceed.  If these negotiations are simply and solely led in a kind of technical bookkeeping exercise by people in the Department of Finance and not by politicians of some vision and courage, then Ireland will get a rotten deal and we will pay high interest rates for short-term money over three years.  The Minister suggested a figure of €80 billion to €90 billion but I have shown that we may need much more in the contingency fund.

We have been asked to carry on as normal in a Dáil with a Taoiseach and a Cabinet that have not a shred left of credibility or political authority.  We have a coalition Government in which one partner has expressed no confidence in the other and has given its notice to quit.The subject of the statements of the eurogroup of finance ministers which met last Sunday was only one of the steps taken in the past week to sell out what remains of the economic sovereignty of this State.  For more than a week this Government tried to deceive the people about the imminent arrival of the International Monetary Fund to take control of our economy.  The Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government took the people for fools but they were found out and the Central Bank Governor,  Professor Patrick Honohan, had to go on radio last Thursday to bring the deception to an end.  On Sunday the Government finally admitted the truth when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, made the announcement that confirmed what had been denied, namely, that the Government was to put the State further into hock with international moneylenders.   The cost is to be savage, with widespread cutbacks that will plunge large sections of the people further into poverty.  Let us make no mistake — if the cuts made are not savage enough for the IMF and the EU they will be deepened even further.  Social supports, public services and jobs will be devastated if this proceeds.Fianna Fáil,  the so-called republican party — although there is nobody on the benches here — having squandered the people's money has now sold out the remnants of Irish sovereignty in order to continue bailing out the banks.  This is all about bailing out the banks.  IMF intervention was brought about directly by the scandalous policies of this Government.  An EU and IMF bailout will not be a bailout for the Irish people, rather, it will be a further bailout for the banks.  The Irish people will still have to pay the price.  It will represent a loss of control over our economy with implications far beyond the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  While the media has focused on this, the reality is that the IMF dictates policy across a whole range of areas and it will mean even more savage cuts to health and education, public service jobs and social welfare, as well as tax increases for the lower paid and the sell-off of Sate assets.  Already the IMF has made clear that it will be looking for the lowering of the minimum wage and the cutting of social welfare payments for the unemployed.  This is totally in line with current Government thinking, which is to hit the lower paid and poor and drive the unemployed further into despair.What of Fine Gael?  Is it the case that it will be happy to see a savage budget passed by Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and, if they are lucky, the so-called Independent supporters?  Is Fine Gael banking on a passed budget, Fianna Fáil taking the blame in the election, Fine Gael sailing into Government and then fully implementing the self same budget?  That is a question many people and commentators are asking.Did Fine Gael know what it wanted yesterday?  Make no mistake about it, Deputy Reilly was calling for an immediate general election and he was right.  I raised an issue with a number of Fine Gael Deputies earlier today.  Deputy Kenny today called for the Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government to remain in office to bring in the budget next week.  There is a major contrast between the leader and deputy leader.  Where do we all arrive at if that is the case?  We arrive at confusion.  Will the Labour Party do as Deputy Gilmore indicated last Friday on the "Late Late Show" and refuse to reverse the cuts in such a budget?The great tragedy is that none of this need have happened.  We need not be facing a savage budget or an IMF intervention if the Government had burned the bondholders, set up a State bank and pursued a real plan for economic recovery.  There would be no call for any such bailout.  It can still be avoided.  Such a real recovery plan has been put forward by Sinn Féin.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has put forward similar proposals and so have individual unions, a whole raft of community and voluntary organisations and many individual economists, both domestically and internationally.Instead, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are about to bring us down the road of so many countries where the IMF has dictated policy.  In Latvia there was a 30% cut in public service jobs and 17 hospitals were closed.  In Greece there were massive wage cuts, job losses and riots on the streets.  In Iceland there were savage cuts in health spending and widespread repossessions and evictions.  In the Ukraine hospitals were closed, pensions were caught and unemployment doubled.  We in Sinn Féin warned earlier this year about what was to happen and in statements on the European Council meeting in July Deputy Ó Snodaigh said:This Government has also tied the State to the EU's blind determination to protect the euro which means participating in the bail-out of Greece when our deficit exceeds that of Greece.  In a few months time we could have the potential situation where Greece is asked to bail out the Irish economy.  This shows the ludicrous nature of what is being discussed and imposed upon us.  It means partaking of a new loan facility fund, despite the demands that fund can put on a state if it avails of those finances.  The EU is becoming the IMF and this Government is signing up wholeheartedly to it, up to the point of agreeing that Brussels should have sight of and commentary on our sovereign budgets in advance of them being put to the national Parliament.  This is an insult to this House and an insult to the budgetary process which has gone through the Oireachtas quite well for a number of years.  The Government is signing up to an interference from outside in our affairs.  That amounts to a loss of sovereignty.One does not have to add how much foresight Deputy Ó Snodaigh showed in what he warned and cautioned about.The outcome of yesterday's extraordinary events has fatally wounded the Taoiseach who wanted to drag the country down with him, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.  It is shameful that the Green Party is denying people their say in an immediate general election and helping Fianna Fáil  to further inflict massive damage on the Irish economy and society.  It is a travesty of democracy.  There needs to be an immediate general election.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	364	When I read some of the material the Government is putting out, it alarms me. The Minister said, "We have challenges but we have responded in a timely and appropriate manner to the challenges which have been presented".  The answer to that is "Yes" if one says the challenges were to bail out corrupt bankers.  That is all the Government has responded to.  It has not done anything constructive for the economy.  That is the fact of the matter.I should be half sorry with the Fianna Fáil part of the Government because the usual practice was that Fianna Fáil would run the economy into the ground, cut to a general election and escape before it was caught.  On this occasion, because it has been in power for so long the Government, in particular the Fianna Fáil part of it, was caught badly and demonstrated clearly its level of incompetence in terms of managing the economy in any sort of constructive way.  That is particularly evident to everybody now because the economy has smashed to such a degree that it will not be repaired for at least a generation before the so-called bailout from the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB is repaid.  That is dreadful.We are supposed to be discussing the meeting of Ministers for Finance of the euro group.  It paid some platitudes to the Minister following the meeting but I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall in the meeting behind closed doors.

Would the Minister agree that the ECB's role in the lead up to this economic crisis should be examined carefully?  It was shovelling cheap finance into the Irish banks without any control, apparent oversight or inspection of what was going on.  Would the Minister accept that it has a part to play in sorting this out?  Would he accept that we should not be genuflecting before the high altar of the ECB or the Commission because of their failures in this scam?I am not exonerating the Minister or the role of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in all of this and how they looked the other way when the Central Bank was also looking the other way.  The ECB is culpable as well and should be held accountable.  It was acting like the bondholders.  It was happy to see cheap credit coming in and believe the Fianna Fáil fantasy that the cheap credit could go on forever and keep everybody happy.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch who were the real victims?  They were Irish people who, to some degree, were suckers in terms of falling for the myth, going for cheap credit and putting themselves in hock to the banks  to a dangerous degree.  It was grossly unfair that it was allowed to happen.There were no big cats in this State.  The Celtic tiger was a myth for the overwhelming majority of Irish people.  There were some fat cats but they were all huddled up in the Galway tent or were the corrupt bankers to which I referred that were bailed out.  No ordinary people became fat cats or enjoyed the fruits of the Celtic tiger.  That was all a myth as far they were concerned.  The upshot of all that is that the IMF has come in.  I met people over the weekend and in my constituency office yesterday who thought the IMF coming in was a good thing.  They were relieved because they felt it would lift the burden of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party off their backs.  Unfortunately, those people do not know how the IMF works.  It imposes a slightly narkier version of the Fianna Fáil policy which is cutting and slashing resources to people who can least afford it, including people with disabilities who depend on this State for their survival and special needs children whose special needs assistants are being removed.  They are the primary target of the IMF.I will ask the Minister questions about the terms and conditions of the loan in a moment, because I would like to know them, and what he believes the parameters for this loan bailout should be.  Is it a loan or a bailout?  It is a bailout in so far as nobody else would give this Government a ha'penny.  It is also a loan because every cent of it will have to be repaid long after the Minister has left office and perhaps long after many of us here, including the Minister and myself, have left political life.  The children of today will still be paying for this bailout.  That is beyond belief.We have been told to behave responsibly and get a budget through.  Sinn Féin want to see a budget passed as soon as possible but we want to see a budget unlike that which the Government proposes.  We want to see those who can afford to pay paying their way.  We do not want to see those on lower incomes being further impoverished.  We believe that is the wrong way to go as it will only depress the economy further.  It is the wrong tack and the Government needs to change direction.  There is still time to do so.  We would like to see a Sinn Féin-type budget being passed by a Government with a fresh mandate.  This Government's mandate is gone.  We have had this Lanigan's ball-type behaviour where the Taoiseach and the Green Party were stepping in and out yesterday, each vying with each other to get out of here as quickly as possible but then deciding they would hang on for another while.  The lunacy of it was beyond belief.We have been told by commentators and Ministers that we must behave responsibly but what does that mean?  I would like the Minister to qualify that.  Does it mean closing further acute hospital beds, depleting the HSE budget even further and cutting home help hours further?  That is what I am interpreting as behaving responsibly.  What I see as behaving responsibly is dealing with a budget which is fair and can do something about this economy and society.  When we look at the budget, we should look at its impact on society.  However, I do not expect that from this Government.It is time the Green Party got on its bike and Fianna Fáil got out of here and called the general election the people so urgently want in order that my party can finally have an opportunity to make a constructive input into a real budget which will not damage society and the economy but will do the opposite, that is, strengthen society and build this economy once and for all.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I wish to share my time with Deputy Kieran O'Donnell.I would like to take up the remark made about my party by Deputy Ó Caoláin when he suggested some issue of consistency between our statements of yesterday and today.  The suggestion made by Deputy Kenny, the leader of my party, to the Taoiseach today to bring the budget date forward to next week was an utterly reasonable one.  It was made in the context of trying to bring some certainty to this enormous difficulty the country faces.  The tiny little brickbats Deputy Ó Caoláin threw in our direction have no validity.  I find it astonishing that Sinn Féin can continue with this kind of pantomime in this House while having absolutely no difficulty involving itself in savage adjustments in Northern Ireland where it is in government.  Its Minister heads the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  No new schools will be built in Northern Ireland next year because of a decision by its Minister.  Consistency is something about which Deputy Ó Caoláin should not lecture anyone.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	370	Deputy Ó Caoláin can give it but he cannot take it.I have three questions which I ask the Minister for Finance to address.  When the IMF went into Greece, the rate of interest on which the loan facility was given was 5%.  The Minister must address what exactly we will pay for this package of funds.  Ireland is not Greece.  The scale of the economic challenge and the economic restructuring in Greece is substantially different from the scale of restructuring here.  Now that the IMF has come in, it would be logical that some countenance be given to the fact that over the past two years, approximately €14 billion has been taken out of the economy and very severe adjustments have been made to public sector pay.  Will that be taken into consideration when the rate of interest on which this loan facility will be given is struck?  The Minister must make a statement about that.I would interested in the Minister's comments on the bilateral loans offered by the Swedes and the British.  He said that the financial assistance programme may possibly be supplemented by bilateral loans.  Who exactly makes that decision?  If these bilateral loans are offered by two governments to this State outside the emergency funding system the EU has put in place, surely that is a matter for this sovereign House and, ultimately, the Government to determine?  Who exactly makes that call?  Will the Minister clarify that because the British have made it absolutely clear that their bilateral loan facility is separate to the funds that will be made available through the emergency fund.  There must be some clarity on that.Deputy Kenny said something on Leaders' Questions which was not taken up by the Taoiseach.  He suggested that Opposition parties should have access to the negotiations going on with the IMF given that whatever deal is brokered will be in effect for some years and there will be a new Government.  It seems crazy that the Government does not have, as a central component of the discussions and negotiations on this package, involvement from the Opposition.  I find that quite astonishing.When the Taoiseach telephoned Deputy Kenny and Deputy Gilmore last evening, I understand the discussion was about information on the budget.  There should be discussions on the bailout conditions and the terms of that memorandum.  The Minister needs to address that issue.

In the context of the review being carried out by the IMF of the balance sheets of the banks, will the Minister indicate what further recapitalisation he expects the banks will require?  What are the amounts involved?  Will the banks require more capital and will it come in the form of extra borrowing by the State that would be put directly into the banks and would basically become part of taxpayers' borrowings?Will the Minister give us a breakdown of the fund and the make-up between what will be banking debt and State debt or public debt — we have heard various figures mentioned — the total breakdown, the rate of interest, the period of time over which it will happen and the make-up of the funds provided by the European Commission, the IMF, Sweden and Britain and the terms of those loans?What discussions are involved in the bank resolution scheme?  We have heard that there are differences between the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on how to deal specifically with bondholders in a banking resolution scheme.  Will the Minister indicate if he is aware of those differences, how are they being manifested in negotiations and what he expects to be the outcome in terms of a bank resolution scheme?  When will that be in place?Our party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, put various questions to the Taoiseach today about bringing forward the budget.  We were told by the Taoiseach this was not possible because we are still in November and tax returns are still coming in.  It should be pointed out that when Deputy Brian Lenihan became Minister for Finance, his first budget was delivered on 14 October 2008.  It was a very early budget and much earlier than what was proposed today.  That was the budget for 2009, so there is a precedent for introducing an early budget.The bulk of income tax revenues for November are in and the Minister is well aware that people filing manually must pay their income tax by 31 October, and those filing through the revenue online service, ROS, must pay by 17 November, which is almost a week ago.  I expect the figures to be available because of the sophistication of systems in the Revenue Commissioners.  One can compliment the ROS, which has been immensely successful for collection.  I expect that the figures for income tax are available to the Minister for Finance.

The information for income tax should be available and there is no reason to delay the budget until 7 December.  If the Government's four-year plan, which is to be published tomorrow, has the 2011 budget as the first year, can I take it that the bulk of the measures in the budget have been discussed at Cabinet level?  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, can clarify that.  If that is the case, there is no practical reason not to bring forward the budget.Our bond yields have gone up again today, although that is an unreal market, and share prices for banks have decreased.  This is a major issue for the euro, and the European Commissioner, Ollie Rehn has stated he would like to see the budget as soon as possible.  Deputy Kenny's proposal to the Taoiseach is eminently sensible and radical but it provides an opportunity for this House to show overall leadership, particularly in the case of the Taoiseach.  He indicated that figures for income tax and other revenues would have to come in over the course of this month but the bulk of Irish income taxpayers are highly compliant, with the majority of funds already in.What are the Minister's views on bringing the budget forward next week, allowing us to have discussions on legislative measures?  We could provide certainty with an early election.  International parties are looking at us now, wondering how Ireland can have a Government with a leader doing nothing more than implementing delaying tactics for political reasons.  The stakes are much higher now but the Minister for Finance could ensure the budget is brought forward with immediate effect.  The four-year plan will be published tomorrow and it is like the chicken and the egg; we cannot have the budget without the four-year plan.  I await the Minister's comments on the matter.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I take very seriously the injunction of the Taoiseach last night that each of us in this Chamber must take responsibility for the positions we hold, particularly as they relate to the budget.  As we speak in the calm of the Chamber, there is considerable chaos outside.  The television news is full of colleagues of the Minister threatening barefisted quarrel at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting and according to the national broadcaster, Ministers are at loggerheads and pointing fingers.  Meanwhile, the Governor of the Central Bank has indicated that the Irish banks are for sale and NAMA has not produced the results that had been hoped for.We are entitled to assurance from the Minister in these circumstances that there is the capacity on the Government side to pass the budget.  If there are injunctions and requests for co-ordination, co-operation and responsibility on this side of the House, we are entitled to see that response from the Government.  I have never seen in my days, not just in here but watching politics as a whole, such irresponsible action as I saw from the Green Party yesterday.  In the current climate, the Green Party portentously telling us that it wants to pass the budget, publish the four-year plan and complete the negotiations with the IMF and EU is irreconcilable to the announcement it made thereafter.  All its members had to do was keep their mouths shut until 8 December but they chose not to do so.The Minister must give us some assurance on what he means by the "budgetary process".  It is unconscionable that the Government expects this House, in the current climate and amidst the actions outside, to continue into the early spring as would be the normal timeline for drafting, publishing, scrutinising and enacting a Finance Bill.  We cannot do so and we cannot put this House on an election footing over 12 or 14 weeks in the current climate.  The Minister must be honest with the House about the capacity of his Department to produce a Finance Bill in the wake of a budget if it is passed in this House.  Otherwise the request to the Opposition is not meaningful.I agree with my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes.  He asked that if we accept there is to be a general election, why has the Opposition not been consulted and involved in discussions about the negotiations with the IMF and the EU?  If the Government is genuinely asking for co-operation from this side, we should know what is going on, what is realistic and what can be expected in the discussions with the IMF and European Union which will set a framework for the fiscal and budgetary situation for at least the lifetime of a new Government.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I invite the Minister to reply to Deputy Rabbitte's questions.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	400	It was my intention to take them in the first instance.On the European authorities, which are assisted by the IMF in the negotiations, the position, as I understand it, is that it is intended to brief the Opposition parties directly later this week on the issues involved in the negotiations.  That is the intention of the European authorities and IMF.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that it is very important that the Opposition parties are put in the picture.  When Commissioner Rehn visited Ireland some time ago he extended an invitation to the Opposition parties to meet him.  I found it regrettable that the leaders of the Opposition parties chose not to meet the Commissioner, although I acknowledge that Deputies Burton and Noonan met him, as did, I believe, a representative of Sinn Féin.  That is the position in relation to the negotiations.On the more fundamental and very fair question Deputy Rabbitte posed regarding the political capacity of the Government to carry a budget, I am satisfied that it has such political capacity and will carry the budget.  The Deputy referred to the capacity of my Department.  My Department has had to work flat out in recent months and years.  I have worked flat out throughout that period and have been in continuous work since last Monday week, largely at the Department.  There are understandable limits to the capacity of my Department in the context of a crisis of this character.I have noted the request of the Fine Gael Party to bring forward the budget.  While I do not impugn the good faith of that request, my Department must prepare the budget.  The plan, which is a plan for national recovery, will be published tomorrow and discussed in the House in the ensuing days.  I hope there will be an ample debate on the plan.  The process will conclude with a budget on Tuesday, 7 December.It is important for the country that we have a comprehensive assessment of the revenues that are available to us before we introduce the budget because the revenues available have a vital bearing on the forecasts for next year, as well as being simply a matter of reconciling the figures for this year.  Deputy O'Donnell is correct that there have been significant improvements in the technology for the transmission of payments to the Revenue Commissioners.  However, a sizeable number of payments are received in the final days and are not fully computed at my Department until these days have elapsed.I have attempted to address Deputy Rabbitte's more fundamental question by stating that, as a result of the meeting of the Government this morning and discussions with different Deputies, I am satisfied that the Government has the capacity to pass the budget and deal with the necessary consequential measures.On the various consequential measures in the budget, while I do not want to anticipate my Budget Statement, a number of legislative items are always involved.  In general, there is always a Social Welfare Bill and Finance Bill.  I cannot rule out on this occasion that other items of essential legislation will be required to support the budgetary measures, although not all of them will necessarily be extensive in size.  In addition, in any event and at all hazards — even Sinn Féin Members will agree — the Appropriation Bill must be passed before the end of the year, as otherwise there is no basis for making any payments in the State next year.On the question of the Finance Bill, the Department is examining a number of options and I am having a number of options examined.  It is important to realise, however, that the resolutions passed on budget night under the relevant statutory machinery permit the relevant taxes to be collected for a substantial period of the ensuing year.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I ask the Minister to address the interest rate which will be negotiated.  When does he expect the negotiations to be concluded?  I presume an essential feature of the negotiations will be determining the interest rate we will pay for the loan facility.  Given that the position of Ireland is significantly better than that of Greece in respect of a large number of macroeconomic statistics, surely we should pay significantly less than the 5% interest rate paid by Greece.  I ask the Minister to provide some information on this matter.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	403	The interest rate is a crucial part of the negotiations.  Deputy Burton highlighted a very important issue in the negotiations, namely, the period for which the relevant funds will be available, in other words, the term of the funding.  One of the difficulties with Greece was that the funding was very short term which will create a funding wall for the country at the end of the three year period.  With regard to variable terms, for example, three year, six year or nine year money, naturally one's interest rate increases with one's term.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	406	That is no longer the case.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	407	That is true in the present circumstances.  In any event, the considerations that determine the appropriate rate of interest vary enormously depending on whether it is short-term, three year, six year or nine year funding.One must also remember that in respect of Ireland's application we are dealing with three different funds, all of which have different rules on the appropriate computation of interest on the principal sums advanced.  In essence, what one will have is a blended interest rate, the computation of which will depend on the proportion one derives from each of the three funds that can be accessed under this particular arrangement.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	408	Given that Ireland is in a different position from Greece, I assume we will pay an interest rate lower than 5%.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I am not entering into the substance of the negotiations on this issue at this stage.  I am simply pointing out that in relation to Greece an arrangement was made for three year money which was very disadvantageous for that country.  We do not want such an arrangement for Ireland.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Does the Minister expect money to be provided on a term longer than three years?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	411	In general terms, longer-term money gives greater security.  It is also important to bear in mind that Greece was facing an immediate funding wall for what I will describe as the Greek Exchequer.  I am not sure if the term "Exchequer" is used in Greece.  We should use "Central Fund", the term used in the Constitution.  The expression "Exchequer" has survived in our financial procedures.  The position in Greece was different in that respect and also to the extent that while the Greek banking system came under severe pressure — it was downgraded and had to avail of unlimited liquidity facilities from the European Central Bank during the period of the pressure — the issue of standing behind the banking system in terms of stability was not crucial in the Greek case.  In the Irish case, we can see that while the Exchequer has certain short-term balances in terms of cash reserves, it also has much more substantial reserves in the pension fund.  While there is considerable reserve firepower available to the Exchequer, there is the issue of putting beyond doubt in a contingent way the fact that moneys can be accessed by the Exchequer for Exchequer purposes.I believe Deputy Burton touched on this point during her contribution in a question on when it was envisaged that Ireland would return to the bond markets.  It of course is envisaged that we should be in a position to return to the bond markets if this arrangement can demonstrate both a funding capacity for Ireland and a confidence that the terms and nature of the programme are such that it assists the economy on a sustainable path.  At the heart of these discussions is the question of the sustainability of the amount of borrowing involved and the interest rates applicable, which is the reason I am not at liberty at this stage to disclose matters of negotiation in that regard.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Before calling Deputy Burton, as I will call the Minister at 6:55 p.m. to conclude and a number of Members are offering, I would appreciate co-operation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne and the Swedish finance minister have indicated that they expect that their money will be available to Ireland at a rate of approximately 3%.  Mr. Regling and other sources have indicated that Mr. Regling's fund essentially will be priced at 300 basis points of a penalty above the German rates.  This probably means a rate of at least 5.5%.  If this is three-year money, the point I was making is that this would be extremely expensive.  Although a state such as Ireland normally could borrow for ten years and not encounter funding cliffs, does the Minister agree that on three-year money, our previous debt that will comes up for renewal or repayment will then go into the three year cycle?  This is what is killing Greece.

Second, can the Minister confirm that the four-year plan to be published tomorrow will in effect be the letter of intent?  The letter of intent is the formal application by the Government and it precedes the memorandum of understanding.  Can the Minister state whether the four-year plan to be published tomorrow forms the basis or the entirety of the letter of intent to be forwarded to the three different parties that will be offering advances to Ireland?

In addition, he might indicate the make-up of the funds from the various participants, such as Britain, Sweden, the IMF and the European Commission.  Finally, with regard to the negotiations on a bank resolution scheme, the Minister might refer to his understanding on the differences between the views of the IMF and the European Union on dealing with bondholders.  As Members have had a long-running discussion on this subject, he might provide clarification.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	419	A number of issues were raised.  First, Deputy Burton raised the question regarding the funding cliff.  I agree with the Deputy that this is a very important question.  As I said a few moments ago, at the heart of this discussion must be our future debt dynamics and the impact of such lending on them.  As for the letter of intent, the plan being published tomorrow is a four-year plan for national economic recovery.  As a programme term typically is of three years' duration, there is a distinction.  Nevertheless, the plan to be published tomorrow is the Government's own view on how the economic and social position can be developed with regard to growth, expenditure, taxation and fiscal controls in the next four years.  Consequently, it is an assessment by the Government and there was no consultation with either the Commission or the IMF on the content of that document.  However, with the leave of the Government, on the substantial completion of the document — because there were textual matters that still had to be addressed and I must attend to some textual matters when I return to my Department after this debate——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	420	Is that the Green Party still being textually difficult?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	421	No, funnily not.  It is just the usual textual tidying up that happens at the conclusion of the drawing up of a document.  This remains to be done and I undertake to give the Opposition spokespersons a copy as early as I can tomorrow morning.  However, the reason for the delay in furnishing them with copies is that much textual work went on in the document over the last 24 hours and final approval for the actual text was secured at the Cabinet meeting today.  However, my point is that while the document was shown at the conclusion of the discussions to the representatives of the international organisations with the authority of the Government, it was not shown to them for the purpose of eliciting their views on any possible amendment.  It is the Government's own view in respect of the four-year period.

A precise breakdown between the facilities has not been agreed.In reply to Deputy Morgan's question regarding the contingent character of the funds, they are contingent in two different respects.  First, in respect of the funding of the State, the funding of the sovereign and its central fund, the position of course is that the State can go to the market and raise funds.  It does not need to rely on the facilities that may be agreed.  That is the position with regard to the funding of the State itself.  Therefore, the funds remain contingent to the extent that the State has a borrowing requirement that it can meet from funds it raises itself.

That is the contingent character of the State funds.  Moreover, the type of funds that may be required  are clearly known from the size of Ireland's Exchequer deficit and projected Exchequer deficits, which will be clear in the plan to be published tomorrow.As for the issue of the banking sector, the position is that the contingent character of the fund arises because, as the Governor pointed out last week, there is a need to demonstrate convincing firepower behind the banking system.  However, the purpose of displaying that firepower, and I wish to take up an issue raised by Deputy Noonan in the debate, is not to provide liquidity funding or cash funding for the banks but to provide potential capital that can be drawn down to give them confidence.  The funding cash requirements of the banks are met by the European Central Bank.  This is so important in the context of the queries that we receive about deposits.  Deposits are not simply guaranteed by the Government but are met by the cash support that the entire banking system obtains as part of the euro system from the European Central Bank.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	436	When this motion was drafted there was quite a lot of speculation that the intervention by the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission would force Ireland to increase its corporate rate of tax.  This would be damaging for Irish industrial policy because the 12.5% tax rate is a key element of Ireland's attractiveness for inward investment.  It is particularly important for the United State of America, which wants a gateway into Europe.  The US wants a highly educated English speaking young population as a potential workforce.  It also wants its corporations to be highly profitable and does not want to pay very much tax overseas.The low corporation tax was a deliberate incentive put in place by the Irish Government.  There used to be a 10% corporation tax rate.  That came under pressure in the 1990s when the rainbow coalition, under the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, was in Government, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, negotiated the 12.5% rate.  It was subsequently put into effect by the incoming Government.  Therefore, the origins of the 12.5% rate are shared by Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil.  When the tax rate came under pressure, I thought it would be important to reaffirm our commitment, across party lines, to the 12.5% rate.I would like if Sinn Féin would also commit to the 12.5% rate.  Their 2007 election manifesto, in the section that dealt with reform of the taxation system, proposed to raise the corporation tax rate from 12.5% to 18%.  I believe that was a serious mistake, arising from a lack of understanding of how Irish industry works and how the incentives work in attracting foreign investment into Ireland.When the motion was drafted and the Fine Gael Front Bench agreed that it would be tabled tonight, it appeared as if the corporation tax rate was under threat.  Now, I believe there was no such threat.  It was an invention by the Minister for Finance, who has just left the Chamber, so that a victory could be claimed by the Government when the 12.5% was not touched.  When I met Commissioner Olli Rehn in Dublin, I asked him a direct question.  He quoted the law and said, "Rates of taxation are matters for the sovereign Government", which indicated that the Commission was not putting any pressure on.We know what the United Kingdom position is, although some of their media personalities would lay the charge that our 12.5% is unfair and that corporate headquarters of UK companies are being switched from London to Dublin because of the low tax regime.  The British would protect our 12.5% rate and combine with us to do so for different, quasi ideological, reasons.  In Britain, and particularly in the Conservative Party, there is a strong commitment to maintaining sovereign control over tax rates and tax matters.  The UK Government would be one of the last in Europe to concede anything there.We were told the Germans were out to get us, but Chancellor Angela Merkel made a statement recently saying she was not putting the 12.5% rate on the agenda if a bailout was being organised for Ireland.  She was quite emphatic about it.  This was followed by a less categoric but quite clear statement by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.  All of those were reputed to be out to get us on the grounds of the 12.5% rate, but it is quite clear they are not.I think I understand Deputy Brian Lenihan's motivation.  The IMF has always been seen as the bogey man of Irish politics.  When we are trying to get the children to go to sleep at night we tell them the bogey man will come or Santy will not come, or whatever the threat might be.  Deputy Brian Lenihan's bogey man was the IMF, which would come if we did not do the right thing on the fiscal side.  After threatening us with it so often, he had to explain why the IMF was arriving.  In a very creative and novel way, as only the Minister could invent, he told us the IMF would protect the 12.5% rate, because being Washington based it would understand the significance of the 12.5% rate and how important it was to attract American investment into Ireland.I do not believe there is a real threat.  However, it is still worthwhile having all-party agreement on it at this time to make a clear declaration that we stand united on this important issue.It is also important to stress that whatever the fiscal correction may be on budget day and whatever is in the four year plan tomorrow, we cannot cut or tax our way out of our difficulties.  If we cut and tax sufficiently and have a parallel growth and jobs strategy there is a possibility that we might work our way out of them.  The 12.5% is a symbol for jobs, growth and secure employment.  There are 180,000 people working in American companies that were attracted into this country largely by the 12.5% tax rate, and they are on the cutting edge of the economy.There is a good story to be told about Ireland as well as all the doom and gloom.  Part of the good story is that we are about to get into a balance of payments surplus.  "Ireland Incorporated" is solvent.  Whatever about the banks and the Government, the country as a unit is solvent.  One of the tests of a country's solvency is that it is exporting more than it is importing.  We are just about to go into a balance of payments surplus in the first quarter of next year.  That is very good news.  In the last quarter for which returns are available, exports went up by 11%.  Manufacturing industry is roaring along in Ireland.  One can see the evidence on the roads, where container trucks head for the ports every day.  They represent the hard work of Irish people in exporting businesses in factories all over the country.  We have a productive workforce who work hard and their jobs are secure.There is a change in the type of jobs that are most attractive and that Ireland is best suited for.  In my city, Dell is often used by the media as a benchmark for failure.  We are often reminded of job losses and redundancies in Dell, but it is now becoming a benchmark for success.  In Limerick, over 1,000 people are employed in Dell and the company intends to hire another 150.  Jobs in the company are all at the higher end of the market.  Dell's financial centre for Europe and the Far East is now in Limerick.  Its logistics section is in Limerick.  Not a single truck goes out of the industrial estate in Limerick but the experts on logistics organise supply to their factories all over Europe and Asia.  We know the concept of just-in-time delivery.  That is all done through the Dell plants out of Limerick.  Of course, those workers are highly paid.  Dell has a huge research and development unit there.  Suddenly, the company is being reconfigured.Anyone who knows the Apple story, especially people from Cork, will remember when Apple downsized to a couple of hundred people and it looked as if it was going to disappear.  The company changed its business model and it grew in a different direction, with more highly skilled and valuable jobs.  Deputy Clune will know the company now employs more than 3,000 people in its plants in Cork.  The nature of work is changing in Ireland.  There is much more high-tech, highly skilled and highly paid work.  Our future lies in the manufacturing area and the corporation tax rate of 12.5% is crucial to it.  It is vital, be it in the IT, pharmaceutical or investment sectors, or any other sector.It is essential to focus on the financial services industry, which is creating and maintaining a very significant number of jobs in Dublin.  It employs skilled people, the majority of whom are graduates.  Much of their work involves back-shop activities, including the processing of data and accounts for others, but, increasingly, they are becoming involved in the real financial services business of trading.  People are trading from Dublin now and this is very significant.  We should be concentrating on this area.  Any jobs policy that accompanies the four-year programme to be published tomorrow should have a section on the financial services industry to determine where it can be tweaked, adjusted and made more attractive.  Many of the people who work in that industry are emigrating.  We could create extra jobs in Dublin.  Former Taoiseach Mr. John Bruton was recently appointed as the main promoter in this area.  I hope the sector will thrive.We should not forget indigenous industry.  We have a great food industry in this country.  Our farmers are producing food of the best quality.  As the processing industry develops, as it has done over recent years, it will continue to comprise a very significant area.  Not only are companies such as Kerry Group doing very interesting work in Ireland and providing very good employment, but they are reversing the historical trend and have invested very significantly in the United States.  Ireland is now a bigger investor in the United States through its multinationals than China.  It cuts both ways.  We need not portray the image of the mendicant with the begging bowl any more across the Atlantic because there is major investment by indigenous Irish multinational companies in industry in the United States.  There is two-way traffic and I do not believe the tax rate of 12.5% will be under threat from the United States because we are a major contributor to its economy.  Long may it last.There is a good story to tell and I hope it is capitalised on in the four-year plan, which is to be issued tomorrow.  If it is all doom, gloom and cutbacks, it will not do the trick, provide certainty, build confidence or encourage people to believe they have a future in Ireland using their talents to work.  I sincerely hope the initiatives we all take will be successful.I will end on a sour note.  The motion proposed is a perfectly good motion that covers the ground and which should have been supported by the Government.  Instead, the Department of Finance, through the Minister, told me it had to file an amendment.  The amendment was cleared by the Cabinet.  The Government is looking for support in the very difficult decisions it is making and the Taoiseach rang the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party last night stressing the importance of what is to happen on budget day, and explaining how essential it is for the country that the budget be passed, yet, in the usual churlish, tribal mode, Fianna Fáil could not agree to support the Fine Gael motion tabled in the interest of the country.  It felt it had to table its own version so Fine Gael would be forced to support a Fianna Fáil motion.  We will see how that plays out in the vote tomorrow night.  If the Government is looking for co-operation and help from the Opposition, it should support our perfectly good motion tomorrow night and withdraw its amendment.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I will start by referring to the last point raised by Deputy Noonan.  I was very disappointed and disgusted to see that the Government saw fit to table a counter-motion to a very clear, simple statement.  All we wanted to do was achieve agreement.  There should have been cross-party agreement and a statement from this Parliament that the corporation tax rate of 12.5% is intact and not under threat of being increased.  The tactics used by the Government are similar to those used by it approximately three weeks ago when Deputy John Perry proposed to introduce a State-backed loan guarantee scheme for SMEs.  We hoped the Government would have accommodated this.  Perhaps the motion was not entirely as the Government would have liked it to be.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, stated last September that a scheme such as Deputy Perry's should be introduced, yet the Government had to vote down Deputy Perry's motion and table an amendment.  Clearly, party politics is entering the equation when it should be a matter of the Parliament standing firm behind the corporation tax rate, which is very important to protect Irish jobs and attract future investment.We are a small island nation on the edge of Europe.  While we speak English and have an educated workforce, we should realise the corporation tax rate of 12.5% has been a cornerstone of our economic development.  It has represented a huge draw in attracting foreign direct investment.When one considers the number of jobs created in Ireland through foreign direct investment, one will note this figure per head of population is higher than that in any other country in Europe.  Foreign direct investment supports approximately 240,000 jobs here.  Foreign direct investment accounts for 50% of our corporation tax and 70% of exports.  It is estimated that it is worth approximately €19 billion in expenditure in the economy.The OECD estimates that a 1% increase in the rate of corporation tax will lead to a decrease in inward investment of 3.7%.  There will be a corresponding reduction in the yield from corporation tax and also in the yield from all the related taxation elements, including those pertaining to employment.Apart from the impact on the economic take, there is an impact in the sense that the corporation tax rate is extremely important for attracting jobs.  If one considers various sectors, including biopharmaceuticals, biotechnology, financial services and technology services, one will note the private sector is actually the main driver of our economy.  The Government only accounts for approximately 20% of our GDP.  We have done so well in attracting large companies, products and services to Ireland.  Eight of the top ten global medical technology companies are present and manufacturing in Ireland.  They have the highest  per capita employment rate across Europe in this sector.  Each of the top ten pharmaceutical companies is operating in Ireland.  In ICT, nine of the top ten companies are based in Ireland.  The number of Internet-based companies is growing.  They are growing their bases here and there are clusters and networks developing in this area.  We must not forget the importance of indigenous companies.  Half of medical technology companies are Irish.  Software is becoming a significant export.  Reference was made to the quality of our food production and the value it contributes to our exports.We must send out a message demonstrating the importance of our corporation tax rate to protecting jobs and ensuring future development.  If we are to get out of the economic turmoil we are in at present, increasing our corporation tax rate will do nothing to bring that day forward; it will make matters more difficult.  That message must be sent out loud and clear to our European partners.Let me quote the Referendum Commission's remarks on taxation during the recent Lisbon treaty referendum campaign: "The European Council has also made a decision which sets out the effects of the Lisbon Treaty on Irish policy and law in a number of areas: the right to life, family and education; taxation; and security and defence."Furthermore, it stated:Ireland's policies on direct taxation cannot be changed by the EU unless there is unanimous agreement in the Council of Ministers. Ireland therefore has the power to veto any such change and the Lisbon Treaty does not change this.  The European Council has stated that nothing in the Lisbon Treaty makes any change of any kind for any member state in relation to the powers of the EU in respect of taxation.That is a very important point.The debate on this matter has probably become academic.  It is important, however, that the Dáil should send out a clear and unambiguous statement in respect of the importance of our corporation tax rate.  I would have liked to have referred to the economic uncertainty into which we have been thrown in the past 24 hours.  Fianna Fáil's partners in government, the Green Party, have contributed further to the turmoil that exists.  We need a general election to provide the certainty and clarity that are required.  We will debate that matter on another day.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I commend Deputy Noonan and his colleagues on the Fine Gael Front Bench on introducing this timely motion.  The biggest crisis the country faces relates to the fact that 450,000 people are unemployed.  The taxation system, whether it be the part which relates to income tax or that which relates to corporation profits tax, is critical to whether people remain in employment, whether new employment is created, whether businesses expand or fold, whether new foreign direct investment is attracted to this country or goes to other EU or global locations or whether existing foreign direct investment relocates elsewhere.  That is why it is important this debate is taking place.It is also important that the House, in the context of the financial straitjacket in which the country finds itself which has led to others coming to our assistance, lays down a firm marker regarding what we believe to be the pillars of public policy that are sacrosanct.  The corporation tax rate is one such pillar.  It is regrettable, therefore, that the Government saw fit to muddy the waters by tabling an amendment to the motion.  At a time when it is seeking cross-party co-operation, it is disappointing the Government has tabled the amendment.  Those opposite should reflect on this between now and the vote tomorrow.There are approximately 240,000 jobs in Ireland that were created and are maintained by foreign multinationals which established operations here.  Foreign direct investment accounts for in the region of 70% of total exports, the value of which amounts to €110 billion.  The companies involved provide 55% of the total of corporation profits tax paid.  In addition, they pay approximately €7 billion in salaries to their staff and are responsible for direct investment in the economy of €19 billion.  It is regrettable, therefore, that any uncertainty should hang over this sector at a time when the critical issue is jobs.In 2008 the OECD carried out a survey and discovered that for every 1% rise in corporation profits tax, there is a corresponding likelihood of a 4% reduction in foreign direct investment.  If one considers this in terms of the impact it could have on the economy, it is clear that 10,000 jobs and €5 billion worth of exports would be placed in jeopardy and €400 million in wages and €1 billion in direct investment elsewhere in the economy would be lost.  In such circumstances, the stakes are enormously high.  Given that 450,000 people, many of whom may have worked in the foreign direct investment sector or in indigenous companies for which corporation tax is critical, are unemployed, I am of the opinion that this is an opportune time to lay down a marker.I agree with Deputy Noonan that the threat to our corporation tax regime may be more imaginary than real.  If our partners, the IMF or the EU in its many guises, are interested in Irish economic recovery, they must recognise that the engine of such recovery must be job creation.  Corporation tax is critical in this regard.  Rather than the lowest, Ireland has only the third lowest rate of corporation tax in Europe.  The average rate across the 27 member states of the EU is 22%.  Ireland's rate of corporation tax is 12.5% but there are two other member states with even lower rates.  It is important to highlight that fact.There have been a number of hostile soundings in recent times, especially from France and Austria, regarding the fact that the bailout package should be conditional on an amendment to our corporation tax regime .  Such soundings do not necessarily come from critical players in the countries to which I refer but they certainly emanate from those on the fringe.  Against that background, we must take account of comments such as those attributed to Mr. Lionel Alexander, managing director of Hewlett Packard, a company which provides approximately 4,000 jobs at various locations throughout Ireland, who stated today that if the corporation tax rate increased, his company would reconsider its investment in Ireland.  That is a salutary reminder of the stakes for which we are playing.There is another matter which we must consider in this regard.  If we were to alter the corporation tax regime, what guarantees are there that companies which have located their operations here to avail of the 12.5% rate that applies would relocate those operations to other European countries?  There are no guarantees in that regard.  The other 26 member states of the EU should take note of that fact.  If the companies to which I refer decided to locate to countries outside the EU, there could be significant outflows of capital from all 27 member states.  The latter must be borne in mind, particularly in the context of the emerging economies in Asia.  India, for example, is turning out more people with PhDs than any other country in the world.  Singapore, China and Brazil in South America are all chasing foreign direct investment.Our corporation tax regime is but one piece of a jigsaw of incentives which make Ireland an attractive location for foreign direct investment.  Other such pieces include our educated workforce, recent legislation relating to holding companies, taxation on patent royalties, etc. and double taxation agreements.  These incentives make locating operations here very attractive.It is also important to take the indigenous sector into account.  Any interference with the existing corporation tax rate could well be the difference between indigenous companies surviving or going under.  These companies are driving onwards, exporting goods and services and are the real engine of our economy in the context of the number of people they employ.  We should, therefore, make haste slowly.  The House should send out a clear message in that context that our corporation profits tax regime is not open to negotiation.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I support the motion.  I agree with my colleagues, Deputies Noonan, Clune and Creed, who stated that it is a shame the Government could not see its way towards supporting the motion and felt obliged to table an amendment.  I am reminded of the spider's invitation to the fly: "Will you walk into my parlour?"  The Government is seeking our support in respect of the budget on the basis that it is the patriotic thing to do.  This is a time for patriotism, for putting the country first and for national solidarity.  That is precisely the reason we tabled the motion.  We want the national Parliament to send out a clear message to the EU, the IMF, the markets and all potential investors that the 12.5% rate of corporation tax is essential to this country and that it must not be changed because it has been the cornerstone of our industrial policy for some years and is our best hope and probably our only hope of recovery in the context of repaying the kind of debt that now hangs around our necks.By tabling this motion, Fine Gael wanted to provide certainty, clarity and comfort to those overseas businesses which have located their operations here and which may be considering making further investment in Ireland.  We also wanted to provide encouragement to those who are considering investing in this country, especially as it is, I hope, beginning to become more competitive again.  It is a pity Fianna Fáil, even as it seeks to spin us into its web by obliging us to accept its budget, in its parlour and on its terms, has reverted to type.The fact remains that clarity and certainty are still required, particularly if we are not to stem completely the flow of inward investment into this country.  Such clarity and certainty are needed very soon, not only in the context of corporation tax but also in respect of all the conditions surrounding the bailout.  Fear of the unknown is corrosive to any business.  It is obvious from radio and television commentaries that confusion abounds about the role and function of the European financial stability facility, EFSF.  Many people appear to believe this facility is great and is similar to a benign uncle who has come from Europe to give us a dig-out.People have approached me and said that it is great we can borrow again.  It probably is great to some extent that we can do so.  Being able to borrow does not mean, however, that it will again be party time.  Further debt could just prove to be another millstone around our necks.  The answer to too much debt, which we now have, is not necessarily access to more borrowing, especially if we do with the money we obtain precisely what we did with our money in the past, namely, pour it into the black hole that is our banking system.  If we do that, we simply pile more debt onto the backs of the taxpayers and we will never regain our financial independence.What are the conditions of access to this contingency fund?  We have been told by the Government that the corporation tax rate is not a condition.  Perhaps it was never even in question.  If it not a condition, what are the conditions?  What is being negotiated on our behalf?  What will the next Government have to implement?  What will we have to administer?  When will the memorandum of understanding be published?  What are the conditions that are precedent to any aid disbursement?In the Greek case, the memorandum contained details of the maximum loan, the price, the duration and the number of instalments, but also the targets that were to be achieved and the methods of monitoring the targets and how programme performance would be measured.  Also, crucially, it outlined the economic and financial policies that the borrowing country must implement in order to strengthen market confidence and, of course, to restore the financial and fiscal position.Our objective should be to minimise the amount of borrowing and not regard the EFSF as a crock of gold into which we can dip and which somehow obviates the need for us to get our act together.  Before that view takes hold — it will be very difficult for any Government in the future to govern if it does — there is a high price, in terms of cost and conditions, on this money.  We want to know what are the conditions and whether they are realistic, acceptable and achievable.Maintaining the corporation tax rate, which probably was never at risk in any event, is not an adequate negotiating position.  I understand for all sorts of political reasons the Government highlighted it as something that might be taken away from us.  In the preparation of the memorandum of understanding, if that is not one of the conditions, we need to know what the conditions are.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	440	It is good to get the opportunity to speak and I will be positive, if at all possible.  The people in my constituency of Meath East, and those in Meath West, have benefited from the 12.5% tax rate that was given to companies to come in here and they are proud of the homes that they built in my county.  Where we have commitments that this will not be touched, it is something on which we must build and we must make a start.The Government's decision today to flatly turn down my leader's proposal to bring the budget forward has driven many more people in the towns of Ashbourne, Dunboyne, Dunshaughlin, Ratoath, Kells, Duleek, Slane, Navan and in north Meath to make a decision to leave this country.  For two long years they have been left uncertain on what will happen and had the Government come out two years ago and told us the truth, our businesses would have survived.  I listen to people every weekend and everybody knows that if the position is not stabilised by Christmas, businesses will close en masse.  Most say they will get to Christmas.Yesterday was the worst day in the political history of this country.  There were Fianna Fáil Members turning on each other.  The Green Party did not know what day of the week it was.  There were the two Independents.  How dare Deputy Lowry lecture Fine Gael on what to do?  Then there was the spectacle at the gate of Dáil Éireann, where every elected Member of this Dáil has been given the freedom to bring in their supporters in a mannerly fashion, not to ram the front gates.The people of Ireland did not know what to expect today, but I am glad my party leader did what he did.  He had the backing of everyone of my party.  The Taoiseach behaved like Frank Sinatra once again.  He did not even go back to his party to ask would they  accept the offer.  He just continued to sing, "I will do it my way".The Government thinks it will get the necessary support for this budget but I, a simple backbencher, will not support it unless the Government puts its cards on the table.  My party will not humiliate the elderly or those who have decided to stay at home and helped to build this country.

We want certainty.  We should not even be talking about this tonight but the truth could not be told two years ago.Fianna Fáil and anyone who wants us to support them must start putting their cards on the table.  They know their days are numbered.  The men of 1916 knew their days were numbered when they took on the rebellion and they gave up their lives for it.  The Government has made a disgrace of this country and its people.  For once in their lives, they should not run away.Ultimately, no one really cares about party politics.  The Government ought not to look for co-operation and do what it did.  My party tabled a motion in the interests of this country and the Government played politics with it again, like it did today.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	445	Like Deputy McEntee, I am disappointed that the Government could not see its way to support this intelligent motion before the House.  I am equally disappointed, when the Government looks for co-operation, that it does not give co-operation to this side of the House.  The people of Ireland strongly mistrust this Government.  My people and those who want to stand by Ireland want to see the back of the Government as quickly as possible.The country needs hope at this time of appalling economic fallout.  Given the air of quiet despair, the citizens need something to cling on to.  Much to the surprise of foreign journalists, civil unrest and protest at the decimation of our lifestyle and our future prospects, as individuals and as a nation, have not surfaced to any marked degree despite the fact that we are being provoked by the Government.Nonetheless, the need for hope of an improved economic climate is paramount.  That hope is tied up with the expectation that foreign inward investment will be maintained.  However, that will only be possible if the 12.5% corporation tax rate is not increased.That tax rate has been the carrot that has helped build up a perception of Ireland as a business friendly country, but any attempt to increase the rate would wipe out the gains at the stroke of a pen.  Anything that increases the cost base for investors is a blow to our competitiveness.  The benefit of any short-term gain to rectify Government fiscal mismanagement would be far outweighed by the long-term fall-out.Although the 12.5% tax rate has stood us in good stead, our competitiveness is lagging well behind other strongly-performing countries.  For example, our labour costs are far higher than those of China and India, which have now overtaken the US as competing locations for Irish subsidiaries.Ireland's poor infrastructure and lack of broadband roll-out in many areas have been a significant drawback to foreign inward investment.  Longford-Westmeath, which has some of the worst roads in the country and has been shamefully let down in terms of broadband coverage and other infrastructure investment, has seen the closure of companies that have relocated to more business-friendly locations abroad.  For example, the recent closure of B3 Cables and Campbell Electronics in County Longford, Nexon's in Athlone, County Westmeath and Gannon Concrete in Kilbeggan raise questions about the serious lack of competitiveness engendered by the Government.The closure of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's offices, both in Longford and Mullingar, were a considerable blow to the midland farming community.  These closures are a direct result of the lack of infrastructure, high business costs and wage levels.  High fuel costs, along with other stealth taxes, have brought about the current economic downturn in the midlands.Longford-Westmeath has a highly-trained workforce and the number unemployed has now exceeded 16,000.  We have been forced to see the closure of businesses, Longford barracks and Granard courthouse which played their part as sources of revenue in the constituency, and were an important part of our heritage.  Given the track record of the Taoiseach and his Government, it is laughable that my colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, stated in the House that——

I am surprised that a Fianna Fáil politician still believes the Government hype.  We have a huge amount of hype from the Government and I plead with the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to reverse the earlier decision and support the motion before the House.  I want to see him walking through the lobbies with the Fine Gael Party.  Be a man of the people and stand by the Republic of which he speaks.

Normally, I would not agree with an Opposition motion but on this occasion there is great value in this House sending a united message on the importance of keeping our corporation tax at 12.5%.While our corporation tax is critical, we must also remember that it is but one element of the investment offering that Ireland presents to global markets.  Ireland's value proposition to multinationals is strongly based on what we refer to as the four Ts: track record, talent, technology and, of course, our tax regime.  Our reputation for excellence in all of these areas continues to attract a strong flow of companies to Ireland.  In particular, all of the multinationals I have met have commended our investment in research, development and innovation.  No matter what sectors they are in, they all see the potential benefits.  This means the Government's investment strategy for science, technology and innovation is the right one to create high quality jobs and to support economic recovery.  Despite the period of global recession over the past two years, Ireland's own value proposition to multinationals operating from Ireland has not changed.  In fact, it has been enhanced.There have been significant improvements in Ireland's competitiveness.  Building costs including energy, private rents, office rents, services and construction labour have all become far more competitive and they continue to do so.  For investors in Ireland, we now offer a greatly enhanced competitive position.  The cost of industrial electricity decreased by 24% between 2008 and 2009.  Gas prices decreased by 25.9% in 2009 and benchmark salaries for new employees in Irish companies are down between 5% and 22%.  Ireland's track record can be seen in the range and quality of multinational companies, many of which have had operations in Ireland for many years.It is also reflected in the high level of expansions by these companies and in the fact that 80% of our exports are now from the multinational sector.  More than 75 multinationals have chosen to make investments in Ireland so far this year.  Of these, 22 are from companies new to Ireland, 28 are expansions or new areas of investment from existing client companies and 25 of the investments are in research and development.  They could locate anywhere in the EU but they have chosen Ireland.  These investment decisions are a vote of confidence in our ability to deal with our financial problems.  It is a vote of confidence in what Ireland has to offer to the international investment community.  Most of all, it is a vote of confidence in us as a nation and our people.Our export performance shows that Ireland's enterprise sector, combining multinational and indigenous companies, is the engine of growth in this country.  Irish exports continue to perform very strongly, increasing by a total of 3.5% from quarter one to the end of quarter three of 2010.  Given global market conditions, it is fair to state that this is a tremendous performance from our key export sectors.  An export-led enterprise policy is a whole of economy strategy.  Export-driven growth delivers sustainable economic growth through the creation of a virtuous circle which impacts positively on all of the key drivers generating jobs and growth.  The boost in secondary employment and the increased consumer confidence which arises as a result of export-driven growth leads to increased levels of consumer spending in the local economy.  Increased export growth leads to sustainable direct job opportunities above those provided by serving the domestic market.  Growth in revenue for firms beyond what the domestic economy can provide gives increased opportunities for locally trading businesses, a substantial ripple effect in terms of job creation throughout the entire economy and the enhanced tax yields that can ensue for Government.An export-focused approach impacts on the local economy in other ways also.  For example, because export firms are directly exposed to international competition, innovation and high productivity are essential ingredients for success.  In turn, they demand high standards from their suppliers, which impacts positively on Irish-based suppliers.  It is in this context that it is important to point out that foreign direct investment into Ireland is now back at investment levels that we have not seen since 2005 and 2006.  The combined influence of Ireland's increased competitiveness and the strong value proposition commitment to our 12.5% corporation tax rate and quick and decisive measures taken by the Government to combat the challenging economic situation has resulted in this excellent flow of foreign direct investment despite reputational challenges.These pre-crisis levels of investment hail from our traditional markets of North America, mainland Europe and the UK as well as new high growth markets.  On this point, the IDA recently opened offices in Brazil, India, China, Russia and Singapore in order to increase the flow of investment from these growing markets.  Given Ireland's strong and long-standing commitment to the 12.5% rate, any movement away from this rate would have a significant negative effect on existing and potential investments.The Government's position on our corporate tax regime is unambiguous.  This commitment is protected in an EU context by the principle of unanimity in taxation matters and is further enhanced by the insertion of a legal guarantee in the Lisbon treaty.  Over the past decade, the Irish Government has pursued a consistent strategy of maintaining a low tax burden on companies so as to support sustainable economic growth and social progress.  Ireland maintains a low general corporation tax rate by ensuring a wide tax base.  The Irish 12.5% corporate rate is a general rate on trading activity and as such is not focused on any particular segment of Irish industry; there is no distinguishing between small and large enterprises or between enterprises that service the local economy and those which have a multinational focus.The recent independent Commission on Taxation report reaffirmed that a low and stable corporation tax rate should remain a core aspect of Irish tax policy.  This view has also been endorsed by the OECD.  Its recent work on tax and growth suggests that high corporate taxes are most harmful for growth, followed by personal income taxes and then consumption taxes.  Some countries have high nominal rates of corporation tax but much lower effective rates due to the use of various base-narrowing devices.  This is not case in Ireland.  Our system is relatively simple.  Corporation tax receipts in Ireland represent approximately the average collected by such taxes throughout the OECD.  Ireland does not support harmful tax competition.  We continue to play our part in the EU code of conduct on harmful tax competition and the OECD forum on harmful tax practices.  Ireland is fully in compliance with the code of conduct and OECD processes.  It is important also to note that the international community does not regard Ireland as a tax haven.  The Irish tax system is fully transparent and fully adheres to international norms.  This is evidenced by the large and growing network of tax treaties that Ireland has in place with other countries around the world.  Ireland has now signed comprehensive double taxation treaties with a total of 61 countries.  Our treaty network is rapidly expanding and now includes agreements with non-EU and non-OECD members.  Ireland's tax treaties allow for full exchange of information with tax treaty partner countries.  Certainty is a key element desired by investors. High corporate tax rates would change company behaviour by disincentivising activity in Ireland and with such an open economy it would be relatively easy for this change in behaviour to translate into a smaller tax revenue base.An OECD multi country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average.  In other words, it would only take a 2.5% increase in the rate to decrease Ireland's inward investment by nearly 10%.  In addition, internationally traded services are an important part of the economy and are expected to grow further as a smart economy develops.  It is likely that companies providing services products are more responsive to tax rates and, therefore, will react more negatively to rate increases than companies in the traditional manufacturing sector.  It is likely that if the rate increased, some foreign direct investment would choose to leave Ireland.  Ireland competes with Singapore and Switzerland for many of its projects and it is likely that these countries would benefit from any change in Ireland's offering to the international investors.  It is important to point out that the countries against which Ireland competes for internationally mobile investment continually improve their tax offerings.  Any erosion in Irish tax competitiveness enhances the position of competing non-EU jurisdictions.  The OECD has pointed out that raising corporate tax is the most harmful tax on economic growth.  It is obvious that an increase in the corporate tax rate is unlikely to increase tax revenue in Ireland.  While some may argue that an increase in the rate now could increase revenue in 2011, this would be a short-term increase and over the medium term, revenue would be likely to decrease.Our 12.5% corporate tax rate is a key economic driver in Ireland's recovery and will enable Ireland to meet its external debt obligations.  This is good for Ireland and for the eurozone.  The Government has set an ambitious target to create 300,000 jobs over the next five years in our new integrated trade tourism and investment plan.  This plan will benefit all sectors of the economy and these are jobs at all skill levels, in all sectors of the economy and in every county.  Our strategy includes a target of winning 780 new foreign direct investments over the next five years.  Our 12.5% corporation rate is central to our ability to attract these investments to the country.As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, I want to reaffirm Ireland's long-standing and long-term commitment to the 12.5% corporate tax rate, which is and will remain a cornerstone of Irish industrial policy.

I affirm there will be no change to our corporation tax.  It is an absolute red line in terms of any discussions that have taken place.  Our corporate tax rate is critical to supporting our economic recovery and employment growth and is a cornerstone of our industrial policy and an integral part of our international brand.Since the 1950s, Ireland has used its corporate tax strategy to encourage the growth of domestic business and attract foreign direct investment.  In 1956, Ireland introduced a zero rate of corporation tax on income from export sales of manufacturing goods.  In 1973, Ireland joined the then European Economic Community and maintained its 0% export sales relief until 1980.  This was then replaced by a low corporate tax on the manufacturing industry of 10%.  In the mid 1990s, the European Commission raised concerns regarding Ireland's corporation tax rates in terms of them being regarded as a state aid.  We then instituted a single corporation tax rate of 12.5% on all corporate trading income from January 2003, with a transition period up to this year for existing manufacturing firms to retain the 10% rate.Our corporate tax system is open and transparent.  While there are currently three corporate tax rates, one of which, the 10% manufacturing rate, will be phased out at year end, the clear headline rates of 12.5% for trading income and 25% for non-trading income makes our corporate tax system extremely transparent to those wishing to establish here.  Our low corporate tax system does not discriminate based on company size or ownership.  It features a low tax rate applied to a wide base and remains a key policy tool for Ireland. Its importance is likely to grow given the weakness of other factors due to Ireland's loss of competitiveness in the boom years and the fiscal constraints imposed by the recession.  It is also important to remember that Ireland is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe.  A low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to core countries.  Based on the many discussions the Department has with multinational corporations, we believe it is likely that if much of the foreign direct investment that comes to Ireland went elsewhere, it would be lost to Europe in its entirety.The recent independent commission on taxation recommended that a low stable corporation tax rate should remain a core aspect of Irish tax policy to support economic activity in the long term.  Furthermore, recent research by the OECD also points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth.  The OECD, in ranking taxes by their impact on economic growth, found that corporate tax was the most harmful.  In other words, governments seeking additional tax revenues would be advised to consider increasing all other types of tax before increasing corporate tax rates.It is important to dispel some of the myths surrounding our corporation tax regime.  The effective rate of corporation tax is difficult to calculate or compare across countries, but studies indicate that Ireland is one of the few countries in the European Union with an effective rate above the statutory corporate tax rate.  The level of corporate tax revenue in Ireland is similar to other EU countries.  Corporate tax revenue in Ireland in 2008 was equal to 2.9% of GDP, just above the average for the European Union as a whole, 2.7%, and has been consistently higher over the last decade.We are committed to doing everything possible to attract and assist foreign direct investment to Ireland.  As mentioned, Ireland now has 61 bilateral tax treaties in place, a system of full exchange of tax information and proper regulation of activities to the highest standards.Taxation agreements seek to eliminate and minimise double taxation that might arise forcompanies operating cross-border.  The agreements cover direct taxes, which in the case of Ireland are income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  These agreements are also key instruments for developing and strengthening economic and trade relations between countries.  They reduce tax impediments that might otherwise deter the development of bilateral trading and investment activities.  The recent signing of our 61st agreement with Singapore represents a significant milestone and is a reflection of the priority the Government has afforded to the role that international business will play in aiding our economic recovery.Foreign direct investment in Ireland is significant and substantial and is of critical importance to the economy.  In 2008, Ireland was ranked fifth in the OECD in terms of inward investment stock as a percentage of GDP.  Equally important, Ireland ranked seventh in the OECD in terms of the relative size of its outward investment.  Foreign investment in Ireland is substantial.  A recent report ranked Ireland as the top creator of employment, relative to population size, from foreign direct investment.  IDA supported companies alone sustain over 135,000 jobs.  Multinational companies, both Irish and foreign owned, account for approximately 75% of corporate tax revenue paid in Ireland.  This share has been rising during the recession as the domestic focused companies are more severely affected by economic conditions.The foreign-owned sector is the key growth engine of the economy in 2010.  Exports jumped by 7% year-on-year in the first half of the year.  The census of industrial production shows that 88% of Irish goods exports are from foreign-owned companies, while the annual services inquiry indicated that 77% of service exports arise from multinational companies.  Approximately 255,000 people are directly employed by foreign-owned firms in Ireland.  Indirect employment is difficult to quantify because of the knock-on multiplier to consumer spending and suppliers but the statistics suggest it could be as many as 100,000 jobs.  As a result, foreign-owned firms account for almost 20% of employment in the economy.Given Ireland's strong and long-standing commitment to the 12.5% rate, any movement away from it would impact negatively on investment and employment.  Certainty is a key desire for investors and any change of policy would result in increased uncertainty about the future direction of the Irish economy and its attractiveness to foreign investment.  Changes to the corporate tax would be likely to have negative long-term consequences.Estimating the size of the behavioural effects is very difficult but they are significant.  An OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average.  In other words, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate to decrease Ireland's inward investment by nearly 10%.  As the 3.7% figure represents an average across a number of countries, it is likely that the effect on Ireland would be greater in magnitude.  Several important factors in the Irish economy influence this figure.  The impact of a rate increase would be likely to be greater if the baseline tax rate is low initially.  Research on this topic suggests that corporate tax rate increases would have the largest impacts on investment in low tax locations.  The asset mobility of companies is an important determinant of responsiveness to tax changes.  Companies in Ireland that have invested in mobile assets are more likely to react to tax rate increases.  In general, companies involved in services production tend to be more sensitive to tax changes because they have lower capital requirements.  A rate increase would, therefore, more severely impact services than manufacturing.  Services companies are more likely to generate jobs in the future as Ireland moves towards a knowledge economy but these jobs would be endangered by an increase in the corporate tax rate.  All the evidence on the corporate tax base in Ireland suggests that the responsiveness of Irish-based companies is probably greater than the 3.7% average figure presented by the OECD.Our 12.5% rate is our salient competitive advantage.  Meddling with it would reduce potential GDP growth, adversely affect employment and reduce the economy's debt servicing capacity.  Corporation tax has been the best performing portion of Irish tax revenue this year.  It is22%, or €473,000, ahead of target and it has accounted for 11% of total tax revenue thus far this year.  Multinational companies account for at least half of total corporation tax receipts.  Ireland proved that by dropping the rate and providing certainty that it was fixed, we could attract further investment and boost revenue.  By changing the rate, even slightly, investment would quickly depart and revenue would fall.I do not believe that our European partners see our recourse to the programme of support from the EU and IMF as an opportunity to exploit control over what are essentially domestic issues.  A number of European prime ministers have already acknowledged the impact such a move would have on our long-term recovery.  Ireland's historic, cultural and demographic ties with the US and other markets are key compensators for our peripheral disadvantage.  To meddle with the 12.5% rate would be counterproductive and deny us a key plank of our recovery strategy.  That is why this Government is committed to its retention and I appreciate and welcome the cross-party support for this position.

If I recall correctly, export sales relief was introduced by the interparty coalition in the mid-1950s in the form of a tax exemption for exporting companies.  Subsequent to our entry to the EEC, it became a 10% rate in 1980.  Questions later arose about whether the rate discriminated between companies and in May 1997, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, announced the aim of the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  That aim was not achieved for five or six years because the rate for indigenous companies had to be reduced from its original rate of approximately 20%.Given that we gained EU approval for our approach in 1998, nobody can describe it as unfair competition.  Over its 50 year lifetime, the policy has in fact seen increases rather than decreases.  It is a cornerstone of our very successful industrial policy.  In the 1950s, Ireland was perceived as an overwhelmingly rural and non-industrialised country.  With the advent of the Single Market and the eurozone, our corporation tax rate has been one of the principal means of catching up with and possibly overtaking average EU living standards.  It has enhanced our competitiveness and is a cornerstone of initiatives like the IFSC.During the past two or three years, our exports to the US were greater than to Britain.  My favourite historical quotation is the following statement by Thomas Addis Emmet to a parliamentary committee in 1798: "America is the best market in the world, and Ireland the best situated country in Europe to trade with that market."We are at present speaking about a headline rate.  Other countries with ostensibly higher taxation rates may in fact have lower effective rates but skilled accountants are required to take advantage of their complicated and voluminous tax books.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, described the 12.5% rate as a key compensator for regional disadvantage.  The City of London, for example, does not need a tax rate of 12.5% because it already attracts significant financial investment.  Similarly, the German economy has many compensating factors as one of the world's leading exporters.People have asked what harm would be caused by increasing the rate by 2.5%.  However, the central issue is not whether companies could bear a higher rate but if faith in this country would diminish.  During the mid-1970s I was posted to Germany, where one of my duties was economic reporting.  During my time in that country I realised the importance of reliability and trust.  When a Government commits to a policy, it must stick to it.  This is particularly true in the area of tax and investment.  I have heard through private sources information that there would be firms, high profile ones at that, which would leave the country very quickly if they could not rely on the public faith we have committed to the tax rate.This was copper-fastened in the Lisbon treaty.  If there are officials in other countries who look enviously on this, particularly in the most prosperous and successful countries, I urge on them the moderation that has served them so well — I am thinking in particular of Germany's position in recent decades.  It would be very damaging to its interests, let alone ours, to try to press a temporary advantage so as to take the floor from underneath our economy.  I am sure that on reflection neither its Government nor any other Government will want to do something that, in the final analysis, as we are all part of the one eurozone, would only compound the problems of other countries as well.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	454	Given Ireland is now engaged in this pretty awful process of having to be bailed out or dug out by at least three international organisations, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, together with a number of individual countries such as the United Kingdom and Sweden which have offered bilateral assistance to Ireland, it appears there is a list of conditionalities being prepared by many of these organisations.  One of the conditionalities which has been suggested as being on the list is that in some way or other Ireland might be forced to give up the 12.5% rate of corporation tax levied on company profits in Ireland as though the fact we are getting a bailout means that this would be an appropriate payback in regard to something which has acted as a particular driver of investment in Ireland.  The suggestion is this has been to the detriment of others in the member countries which are involved in assisting us in our difficulties with our banks.  It is useful that we have a discussion on this issue, and I thank the members of Fine Gael who have moved this motion.The issue of tax on company profits is not simply a matter of headline rates.  Even if it were a matter of headline rates, the Irish rate is not so out of line as is sometimes suggested by people who might not have actually looked at the situation in detail.  Headline rates are not the important issue, which is the effective rate of tax, including the treatment of dividends and also including the important issue, which does not get counted in corporation tax, of the level of subsidy which can be made available by countries trying to attract mobile international investment.The other major issue in regard to Ireland and other countries is that of write-downs, particularly for depreciation on plant, machinery and buildings, and also, nowadays, of research and development or in regard to work that involves the creation of patents and patent rights and entitlements.  What is interesting is that in terms of the OECD statistics, the corporation tax revenue to GDP ratio in Ireland in 2006 was 3.8 and in the EU-15 was 3.4.  The figure for Ireland was 3.5 in 2001 and 3.4 for the rest of the EU-15 in the same year, and for Ireland it is 2.7 this year.  Therefore, the suggestion that Ireland is way out of line is not necessarily correct.When one considers the treatment of depreciation in regard to writing down buildings, plant and machinery and so on, Ireland is at the more conservative end of the depreciation range.  Ironically, countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Belgium grant far more generous terms according to the OECD information on write-downs in regard to depreciation.  It would helpful, although difficult to achieve, if we had an accurate picture of what the effective tax rates, dividend treatment, write-downs such as depreciation and write-downs of investment in research and development are in all the different countries because I suspect the real picture is a little different.Some are very critical of the low Irish corporation tax rate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has just pointed out that the Irish treatment of corporation tax as an attractor and generator of foreign direct investment goes back to the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman in the Fine Gael Government of that time, if I remember correctly.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	456	He was the Minister for Finance in the 1950s, when there was the development of the world famous concept of the Shannon free airport development area and the notion of tax-free zones as a way of developing in countries which otherwise lacked employment specific areas where foreign investment would be attracted and would not be troubled too much by local tax rates because they were exporting the product.  In 1981 a 10% rate of corporation tax was introduced for manufacturing.  Following European Union approaches on the issue, in 1997 the then Labour Party Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, introduced a 12.5% corporation tax on trading.  This was followed in 1999 when the then Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, confirmed in the Finance Act the negotiation with the EU partners of a 12.5% rate.  This was agreed by the EU because there had been a tradition of generating employment in Ireland through export sales relief.  In those days, much export sales relief effectively equated to a zero rate of corporation tax.  Therefore, the 12.5% rate being introduced effectively brought about a higher rate of tax on foreign multinationals in Ireland while offering a lower rate of tax to companies in Ireland, such as domestic banks.The critics of the Irish lower corporation tax rate often characterise it as a race to the bottom or fiscal or tax dumping, whereby foreign investment will be attracted to countries with the lowest rates.  This is said to represent fiscal dumping by that country against other countries which would otherwise compete more successfully to get that investment.  In the way international mobile investment has developed, that is now quite out of date.  I understand the grievance many people feel.  If an ordinary worker is paying low rate income tax of 20%-41% why can corporation tax not be at the same rate?  It might be said looking for that would be a case of cutting one's nose to spite one's face.The argument for State intervention for a low rate of corporation tax in Ireland is based on two grounds.  The first is the market failure which followed the Act of Union when manufacturing stopped here, through to the Great Famine, the land wars and Irish independence, when we could not produce enough employment to keep our people at home and therefore looked for an attractor for foreign direct investment.  I say to our European friends that, unfortunately, the same need continues.  Irish capital has not generated worldwide firms that maintain their employment in Ireland.   Indeed, it exercises an enormous tendency for such firms to disinvest in Ireland and go abroad.  A second issue is what economists call asymmetry.  The biggest asymmetry for Ireland, I say to our European friends, is that we are a small island out in the Atlantic rather than in the core of countries at the heart of the European Union which share a common mainland and therefore have much lower costs.   We need some kind of measure in order to get over our historical difficulties of market failure in regard to capital and because we are a peripheral country.  Other such countries require the same consideration.  The fact that we have an element of advantage in regard to corporation tax makes the playing pitch more even.  I would also point out to our European friends that the fact that Ireland has an attractive corporation tax rate may assist foreign investment in other European countries because foreign corporations — which call themselves global corporations nowadays — rather like that situation.U2 is a world famous band whose example is one I pose to our European friends.  The band had, and has, all the advantages of artist tax relief on its copyright here.  However, for organisational purposes the band moved many of its activities to Holland which, on the surface, is a very high-tax country.  I pose the U2 conundrum.  Why is it more attractive for U2 to move many of its activities to Holland for tax purposes, despite apparently enjoying such enormous advantages in Ireland?  These include not only the 12.5% corporate rate but the extraordinarily attractive treatment we have for intellectual and cultural works of art, the band's songs included, which are copyrighted here and sold on.  Our foreign friends should consider that.

Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháíl le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre as an am a roinnt liom.On this question James Connolly once used the phrase "ruling by fooling".  He would certainly have had plenty to justify that thought in the midst of the comic opera farce which is the hallmark of the dying days of this Government.  He would also perhaps be tempted to coin a new phrase — Opposition by fooling.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party are attempting to fool the people into believing they are outraged by the current Administration's plans to savage the Irish people in the interests of its banker and speculator friends.  The truth is the parties have accepted the timetable for reducing the deficit and have also accepted the need for massive cutbacks which will be borne by the ordinary people of this State.  They may argue about whether the cuts should be of the order of €6 billion or merely €4.5 billion and may express outrage at control of the country's finances being handed to the IMF.  They may castigate the Government which has been responsible for that outcome.  However, when the smoke clears they, too, have signed up to the consensus for cuts.  They, too, have expressed their willingness to act as the executive arm of the IMF.  Whatever theatre is being acted out between the parties has merely to do with which one of them will have the biggest number of seats in the future coalition that will administer the cuts when the present sorry bunch shuffle off the stage.When Fine Gael and Labour Ministers come to close schools, sack nurses and cut the minimum wage, of course we will be told how much better they do it rather than Fianna Fáil or Green Party Ministers doing the same.  They will do just as they did when they were in government during the 1970s and 1980s.  It is puzzling, in the midst of the current turmoil when inspired leaks hint at what the budget has in store for us, that Fine Gael, using this Private Members' time, should hone in on the issue of corporation tax.  We are told that the minimum wage will be reduced, people's homes will be taxed,  we will have to pay twice for our water,  social welfare payments will be cut and thousands of public servants will be thrown on the dole.  One would imagine that Fine Gael might regard these as issues of major concem and an appropriate subject for Private Members' time.  Most people certainly would assume they were.  However, to do so would be hypocritical as that party has already indicated it will do the very same thing——

The motion concerns corporation tax and why it is or is not appropriate to discuss this matter today.  I am setting that context, pointing out it is hypocritical to continue in that line when the party has indicated it will do the same or worse when it is in power.In regard to taxation or any other aspect of domestic economic policy my party will not accept being dictated to by the IMF or the EU.  That includes not being forced to increase the rate of corporation tax.  My party is the only party which is consistent on that issue because we are the only party in this House which is not willing to implement anything the IMF tells us to.  We are also the only party in the House that opposed the Lisbon treaty which surrendered further control over this State to Brussels.  In fairness, that appears almost irrelevant in the context of the current abject surrender to the IMF.Is Fine Gael telling us it is acceptable for the IMF and the EU to tell us to sack thousands of workers or sell off State assets but not to raise corporation tax?  Clearly, that is what it says.  Does the Labour Party agree with Fine Gael on that point?  If not, how will that party resolve the issue if and when it is in position on the other side of this House?  Will the Labour Party use the excuse it has been placed in a straitjacket and has no choice but to do beastly things to the people who elected it?We oppose all diktats from the IMF and Brussels that have to do with destroying our public services or raising corporation tax.  In that we are at least consistent. As far as I am aware,  no party currently advocates raising the rate of corporation tax.  Why waste time in the middle of an unprecedented economic calamity having all of us  say what everyone knows already?  Perhaps there is a reason but it does not lie in this House.  It may lie in the north west of the country where a by-election is being held.  I say that only because in announcing this motion Deputy Kenny specifically asked my party to state what our position is on corporation tax.  All he had to do was ask our good friend Google who would have told him exactly what our policy is.  He might even have picked up the telephone and put the question to my office or to the office of any of the Sinn Féin Deputies.  How much help that would be to Deputy Kenny's candidate in Donegal South West is another matter.  The motion is a red herring and was such when Deputy Kenny raised it.  If it was tabled in an attempt to score political points or to influence the electorate it was misplaced and badly researched.  It is also a bizarre topic on which to base a debate in the current circumstances.  No party here advocates increasing corporation tax and in the context of what is coming down the line it is hardly the most pressing issue.Much has been made of the part the tax rate has played in attracting overseas investment.  That is fair enough.  However, perhaps we ought also to reflect on the reasons the tax exists in the first place and why this State has become so dependent on overseas investment.  The reasons have to do with the historical failure of those in this country who have real wealth to invest it productively here.  Anyone familiar with the economic history of this State between the 1920s and the 1950s will know successive Governments beat their heads against a stone wall in attempting to get the so-called Irish capitalist class to invest in manufacturing in this country.  This was at a time when a huge proportion of the assets held by the Irish banks were invested overseas and through the London Stock Exchange.  At one stage Seán Lemass accused them of ritual economic treason.  What would he say today if he was here and what would he think of his party's capitulation to the very same traitors?  When he went out on the morning of Bloody Sunday, 21 November 1920, with the Dublin brigade of the IRA, did he ever conceive that one day a so-called republican party would indenture the Irish people in the interests of those economic traitors, as my good friends, the Garda, has called them?It was the anti-national refusal of those banks to invest in Irish development that persuaded Lemass to seek overseas investment.  That is why we have the current taxation structure and why it is necessary.  It was the anti-national behaviour of the banks and major speculators which landed us in the current mess.  While the productive base of our economy was largely driven by overseas capital, such people were gambling in property and finance.

I wish to know whether the site can be acquired by the State from the Mercy Order under the redress scheme.  These are two major schools in Cahir town which is the fastest growing district electoral division in south Tipperary according to the previous census.  The boys school caters for 180 boys and the girls for 298 girls, including junior and senior infants.  The staff, boards of management and school community provide an excellent service to local families but despite that they operate in facilities which are inadequate, inappropriate and not fit for purpose.The boys school, established in 1964, pays €40,000 a year for rented portakabins while the girls school pays more than €20,000.  The Sisters of Mercy some time ago provided figures which indicated the amount of interest paid over the past 20 years alone would have paid for the site.  The need for the amalgamation of the schools has been long acknowledged and has been agreed locally by both school communities.  The adjacent site, which is between both schools and is in the ownership of the Sisters of Mercy, is the only site which is suitable and amenable to both schools.The acquisition of this land is an urgent matter and I hope the subject can be progressed.  It must be progressed.  I have been dealing with this issue since 2007 and before as a member of the county council.  I met the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Hanafin, in Thurles with a deputation.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, visited the school when he was Minister for Education and Skills, saw it at first hand and gave some hope.  There was a blockage at departmental level with officials which was very unfair to the Sisters of Mercy.  The officials insisted they were not engaging in negotiations.  The head bursar, whom I complimented, gave me correspondence which she sent on two occasions to the Department, but it got lost somewhere in the bowels of the organisation.  She was willing to sell the site and facilitate the need for the school.Land prices have decreased since then.  I have asked the previous Minister and the current one whether the site could be included in the redress scheme which has been agreed by the Sisters of Mercy and the Government.  The site must be acquired in order that we can give some hope to the teachers and pupils in the school and the wider community that a proper, modern and decent building in which to educate the young children of Cahir and the surrounding areas every day will be built.The situation is wholly inadequate.  I thank the Department officials who have engaged with me, previous Ministers and the current one but action is now needed because the situation is perilous.  If the site is acquired, the planning and design process will have to be started and the many other stages will have to be gone through.  The site between the two schools is lying idle and is in the ownership of the Sisters of Mercy who are willing to sell it at a reasonable rate with independent valuations or whatever.  Correspondence sent to me from the Department indicated the order was not willing to sell or was not engaging, which is an injustice.  The information was misleading and very unfair to the Sisters of Mercy who have given tremendous service to the town and community of Cahir in education and many other areas over the past century.It is time this was brought to a head and meaningful negotiations took place.  Whatever officials are needed should visit the area and try to do the deal.  It was recently suggested that moneys have been returned to the Department of Finance from the Department of Education and Skills.  Cases like this are held up by bureaucracy.  It is unfair, unacceptable and must be dealt with.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I am happy to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan, who, unfortunately, cannot be present.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the current position of the proposed amalgamation of Cahir boys national school and Our Lady of Mercy national school.Modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The Department's planning and building unit assesses all applications for capital funding.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting, based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc. leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.The staffing level of Cahir boys national school comprises a principal, seven mainstream assistants, two permanent learning support teachers, one release time post and two temporary language support posts.  It had an enrolment of 180 pupils in September 2009.  Our Lady of Mercy national school has a current staffing level of a principal, 11 mainstream assistants, one permanent shared resource teacher for Travellers, one permanent resource teacher, two learning support-resource and two temporary language support teachers. It had an enrolment of 298 pupils in September 2009.  In 2004, agreement was reached to amalgamate the two primary schools in Cahir.  The application was assessed and the project was assigned a band rating of 1.4.  The long-term projected staffing for the proposed amalgamated school was determined as an administrative principal, 24 mainstream assistants and four learning support-resource teachers.  A special needs unit will also be provided as part of the accommodation.A technical inspection was carried out in 2006 on the existing school buildings to determine which would be suitable to act as a host for the amalgamated school.  The report concluded the most suitable building to facilitate the amalgamation would be the girls' school due to its relatively large floor area, good condition of the general building fabric, reasonable development potential and relatively good access to a public roadway.  The report also recommended an additional portion of land be acquired from the Sisters of Mercy to the north east of Our Lady of Mercy national school to facilitate the development.  The Department has received an offer of lands from the Sisters of Mercy under the residential institutions redress compensation scheme.  The Department is considering this offer in the context of the religious order's response to the Government request for an increase in its contribution under the redress scheme.On conclusion of the acquisition of the site, the progression of this building project required to facilitate the amalgamation from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  The amalgamated school building project for the primary schools in Cahir, County Tipperary, will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the current position regarding the school building project for the primary schools in Cahir, County Tipperary.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, is in the House to deal with it because responsibility for the Dell element of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was transferred from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the Minister of State's Department a few months ago and he is directly responsible for it.I raise this matter because I want a definite answer.  The Dell redundant workers association was established in December 2009 following the announcement of a huge number of redundancies in Dell and in a number of related companies.  Since then it has provided a service for redundant workers as well as lobbying for the fund to be set up and for the application to be submitted on behalf of Government.  It has been doing this on a voluntary basis over the past year and has provided a huge service to its approximately 1,700 members.  It is recognised as a social partner in the EGF project and is represented on the steering committee.The Minister of State's predecessor in charge of this fund was the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  On 1 February 2010, he advised the workers that any expenses legitimately incurred in respect of EGF-related activities would be reimbursed, especially since it was effectively the only organisation actively working EGF-related issues with the redundant workers.  At that time, the EGF co-ordination unit had not been opened.It subsequently submitted a spread sheet in April 2010 but was told the format was not appropriate.  It resubmitted its accounts in accordance with Department regulations on 9 June 2010.  It made frequent inquiries but it was not until 26 July 2010 that it was informed its accounts were not acceptable in their current format.  Again, it got to work and had its accounts audited with the advice of the departmental office.  It submitted another application on 22 September 2010, which is more than two months ago, and it still has not had any news about the funding.This is very urgent because the association is in danger of having to close its office unless it gets this funding quickly.  That would be a tragedy for the workers concerned.  A large number of them come to see me.  They are still trying to access support from the fund, whether for training, community employment schemes, higher education, setting up their own businesses, co-operative groups working to set up enterprises or for advice on social welfare and a variety of other matters.  That group of workers has given huge support to all the people concerned.  It informs people of their rights.  There are still people who do not realise they are allowed to access the fund, in particular people in the other companies.  The people in Dell were, by and large, aware of their rights but people in the other companies, whether down stream or up stream companies, did not know about their rights and would not have been able to get the kind of help needed were it not for this group.It has done trojan work and is entitled to funding for the work it does.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to clarify the matter.  My colleague, Deputy Penrose, tabled a parliamentary question which was answered last Tuesday.  The reply stated that expenditure claims are currently under examination.  I hope there will be a successful conclusion to this application.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  As the House may recall, Ireland successfully applied to the EU budgetary authorities under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGF, for co-financing assistance in support of redundant workers formerly employed at the Dell computer manufacturing plant in Raheen, County Limerick, and at a number of approved ancillary enterprises.The application for assistance was made by the Irish authorities in June 2009 and was subsequently approved by the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament in December 2009.  EU funding transfers under the EGF were made to Ireland in March 2010.  The EGF application was for a total of €22.8 million, of which the 65% EU contribution received is €14.8 million.  The remaining 35% of total costs is being met by the Government from Exchequer and national training fund sources.From the point at which the large-scale redundancies in Dell, which so affected the mid western region, were first announced in January 2009 up to the present time, considerable efforts have been, and continue to be, made by the Government, State agencies and educational institutions to support and assist the more than 2,800 workers affected at Dell and at the approved ancillary enterprises.  In an overview to date, 2,600 workers have received occupational guidance; almost 370 are availing of VEC training programmes and vocational guidance; almost 320 are utilising the FÁS administered EGF training grant for private training; almost 530 are on FÁS training courses; 180 are on third level courses; almost 100 have been approved by city and county enterprise boards for new business start-ups with more than 140 more proposals being assessed; by the end of the year up to 100 will have been placed on internships with companies in the areas of medical devices, logistics, business administration and finance; and more than 60 more are on FÁS community enterprise schemes.  All supports are demand led with take-up ultimately dependent on individual choice.The workers in Dell were not unionised and in September 2009 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as the Department with policy responsibility for the EGF nationally was contacted by a group of former workers calling themselves the Dell employees representative committee.  On request, Department officials subsequently met in October 2009 with a delegation from this group and the general background to the EGF and the application process was explained to them.  No other group came forward then or subsequently claiming to represent the Dell redundant workers or cohorts of them.  As such the Department engaged with the only group which held itself out as representing the interests of some element of the redundant workforce from Dell and other ancillary enterprises.Subsequently in December 2009, the group appeared to change its name to the Dell redundant workers association.  By request, it met the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Calleary, in Limerick on 1 February 2010, as mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan.  The group was also granted representation on the EGF steering committee established by the Department and which met for the first time in April 2010 to advise on the implementation of EGF co-financed supports from the workers' perspective.The group's representation on the EGF steering committee was agreed to ensure the former workers could relay any on the ground concerns to the agencies and bodies involved in providing EGF assisted supports and directly to the EGF co-ordination unit in FÁS established to co-ordinate all such efforts.  A dedicated EGF co-ordination unit was established locally by FÁS and put in place in February 2010.  This unit was dealing daily with large numbers of redundant Dell workers, apprising them of the services on offer and trouble shooting all relevant EGF related issues.  A two day information fair was hosted by FÁS in Raheen in February 2010 at which all relevant agencies and educational institutions showcased the services and supports on offer to the redundant workforce under the EGF.The work of the EGF co-ordination unit has been pivotal in achieving considerable progress in providing a wide range of guidance, training, educational opportunities and enterprise supports to EGF clients in Limerick and the mid west region.  The unit monitors the take-up of supports across all service providers and associated levels of expenditure while the Department of Education and Skills is the managing authority for EGF funding at the national level following the reorganisation of certain Department functions earlier this year, as has been noted by the Deputy.As the Deputy will be aware all public expenditure, whether nationally or EU-sourced, must be accounted for in detail and be totally transparent.  Before any decision can be taken in this matter it is required that any claimed expenditure must be clearly linked to the progression of the aims of the EGF.  Again in an audit context there must be transparency on all expenditure in terms of a verifiable and accountable audit trail.The EGF co-ordination unit in Limerick sought initially to assist the group on an exploratory basis to organise and review the expenses, which its members claimed were its due on a "without prejudice" basis.  The EGF co-ordination unit currently continues to seek to elicit sufficient documentary information in order for the Department of Education and Skills as national managing authority for the fund to make a decision on this matter.  I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to address this issue and I will continue to keep in touch with her on the matter.

The first anniversary of this flooding passed on 20 November this year and we are still awaiting confirmation of what type of relief work might be done, with nothing done as of yet.Up to 20 families had to leave their homes at the time and some have abandoned their homes completely, living in rented accommodation while continuing to pay mortgages on the houses affected by flooding in the area.  I am aware of two families in the Caherlea area whose insurers will not cover them for flood damage, quoting increases from €500 per year to almost €2,000, which is a 400% increase in premiums.  These houses are worthless and people could not sell them even if they were offered for sale.  Some people are very anxious to get out of the area but the Government has not provided for any relocation scheme.  If a property tax is introduced in the upcoming budget, how can people be taxed on a worthless house?Last November saw the worst flooding in a number of years but there have been threats of flooding and flooding in the area on five different occasions in the past ten years.  It is constantly under threat.  Two weeks ago the water rose in the area and people were worried again.  This problem will not go away.  People are living in constant fear and despair, which is why some sought relocation which they did not achieve.  Some of the affected people would leave those houses and gladly take some of the properties owned by NAMA just to get out of the area and have peace of mind.  They do not want to live in constant fear that the flooding will occur again; there is no doubt that the flooding will return.  Despite this, not a spade has been put in the ground to give those people some hope.I received correspondence from the Minister of State on 4 November, for which I thank him, but I was not very encouraged by it.  The letter indicated that the main stumbling block is archaeology and it seems that Claregalway is an archaeological hot spot, with a preliminary geographical and topographical survey having been carried out.  The results have been forwarded to the national monuments unit in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which will decide on whether future investigation and monitoring is necessary prior to and during the proposed work.Has the appropriate Minister received the report?  We are sick and tired of seeking and waiting on reports.  The Minister of State indicated it was not possible to give a timescale for the advance works due to the uncertainty associated with the archaeological work.  He also indicated that the Office of Public Works is in the process of procuring environmental and engineering consultants needed to complete the scheme design.How much has already been spent on the reports and any work done since the flooding?  I was involved in a similar case in south Galway in 1995, when the entire area flooded, with a national school and nine houses cut off for nine weeks.  The local people at the time carried out an unofficial drainage scheme, opening a channel from Kilternan national school to the sea.  That area has not flooded in subsequent years, despite the fact that last November all other areas in south Galway were under six feet of water, a greater depth than the flooding in the 1990s.  That is proof that the work can be done.South Galway was in my constituency at the time when the Peach report was commissioned by the Government, costing €1.2 million.  No work has been carried out in the area since.  The people of Claregalway, Lisheenavalla, Caherlea and Carnmore are worried that no work will be carried out.  They are living in fear and I would like the Minister of State to give me an assurance tonight.  We have had many public meetings, with the Minister of State attending at least one of them in Claregalway.  Great hope was given to the people that those works would be carried out but nothing has been done.I fear very much when I hear of preliminary geographical and topographical surveys.  I have met such work before in the wildlife section of the Office of Public Works but it bogs down schemes.  Are people's lives not more important than these surveys?  They are and people should not be condemned to live in fear of nothing being done to alleviate problems.  I hope the Minister of State will have some news for those people tonight.

I am pleased to say that during 2010 considerable progress has been made in Galway in addressing the many flooding problems which have afflicted the area over recent years.  Following the November 2009 flooding, a joint working group, comprising the Office of Public Works and Galway County Council officials, was set up with the objective of identifying flood mitigation measures for Galway.  This group was tasked with assessing the flooding impacts at over 90 locations throughout the county.  In light of their assessment, the OPW has provided funding to the local authority in excess of €3 million under the minor flood works scheme in respect of a range of flood mitigation measures at more than 60 locations throughout County Galway.  That is far in excess of minor flood relief works approved in any other part of the country.The joint working group also concluded that given the extensive nature of the flooding affecting Claregalway and the Dunkellin areas, major flood studies were required to identify a plan of measures to address the significant risks involved in these areas.  Subsequently, Ryan Hanley consulting engineers were commissioned by the joint working group to undertake the Clare river flood study.  The study was published in June this year together with the recommendations of the joint working group, and I discussed this at a public meeting in Claregalway in July.In essence, they have recommended a major scheme of works on the Clare river as follows.  At Miontach south, the access road is to be raised and culvert sizes are to be increased together with some maintenance work on existing drains.  At Miontach north, the access roads are to be raised.  At Claregalway a flood eye will be installed at Claregalway bridge and the channel will be regraded from a distance upstream to under the bridge.  A breach in the wall will be repaired at An Mhainister estate and a local embankment at old Nine Arches bridge will be provided.  At Kiniska, the capacity of existing culverts will be increased on the OPW scheme channel and some maintenance works on the channel will be carried out.  At Lakeview a surface water outlet downstream of Claregalway bridge will be provided.  At Caherlea and Lisheenavalla flood eyes will be installed on Crusheen bridge and the existing channel will be widened for a distance of 900 metres upstream of Crusheen bridge to Claregalway.  Islandmore drains, which are located on existing OPW scheme channels, will be cleaned and regraded.Furthermore, a study of the Carnmore area has recently been completed and the flood relief measures proposed in this report will be considered for inclusion in the overall programme of works to be undertaken in the Claregalway area.My officials are in the process of procuring both engineering and environmental consultants to complete scheme design and attain the necessary statutory permissions for the scheme.  Funding for the detailed design of the scheme and commencement of construction works is currently included in the financial programme of the Office of Public Works for 2011.A number of environmental considerations associated with the proposed main flood relief scheme may need to be addressed in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  These can only be determined on completion of the appropriate assessment by our consulting engineers in accordance with the Article 6(3) of the habitats directive and an environmental impact statement.  It is also a prerequisite that the scheme be exhibited by the OPW to elicit public reaction and if generally welcomed, the OPW will put it forward to the Department of Finance for confirmation and financial approval.  Subject to everything proceeding as envisaged, it is hoped the scheme will be on the ground in 2011.  However, the timescale will be influenced by a number of factors, including the scale of the proposed measures and the progression of the associated statutory consent processes.  Every effort will be made by the OPW to ensure any approved scheme is implemented as quickly as possible.The OPW has also agreed to carry out some interim flood relief measures in advance of the main scheme.  These consist of the construction of a flood eye at Claregalway bridge and subsequent replacement of Crusheeny bridge.  However, a number of archaeological issues have arisen near the Claregalway bridge site.  It is expected that these issues will be resolved in the near future, thereby allowing the interim works to commence shortly thereafter.In general, I concur that lives, livelihoods, homes and so forth take precedence over other considerations, although this does not mean they simply override them.  However, as I have stated on many occasions, in an accommodation, in the last analysis flood relief and protection must take precedence.I reassure the Deputy that I continue to give priority to the efforts of my office to minimise and mitigate the flood risks in the Claregalway and general Galway areas.  I am confident that the next Government, whatever its composition may be, will find that we have done very good groundwork.  Many measures are either in the process of being implemented or have been readied up for implementation.

I also believe the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey, responded on at least one of those occasions.Adults with special needs who require dental services, including routine or minor treatments such as fillings and cleaning, must have the work done under general anaesthetic.  This usually requires a day procedure in hospital for which theatre space is required.  In the Cork area such procedures are performed in Cork University Hospital.  Following the development of a significant waiting list for dental services for adults with special needs, a new service was established in Cork in October 2009.  As it amounted to only one session per month and usually involved the treatment of only one or two persons, depending on the nature of the work, the service has failed to make an impression on the waiting list in the 12 or 13 months it has been in operation.I have spoken to people who have been waiting for more than three years for services and there is still no sign they will be treated.  Recently, for example, the mother of a man of 29 years contacted me because her son was waiting for treatment at Cork University Hospital.  He required a filling and had a developed an abscess which could not be treated owing to another medical complication.  As a result, antibiotics could not be administered and he howled in pain for more than a week until some form of pain management was eventually provided.It is pathetic that individuals in this position who deserve to have a dental service provided to them are neglected in this manner.  Everyone, whether a medical card holder or private patient, should be able to access routine and commonplace procedures such as fillings.  The individuals in question, their families and carers are experiencing major trauma.Additional theatre space is required to reduce the waiting list for treatment.  A serious attempt must be made to eliminate the backlog of more than 200 patients.  Once this has been achieved, it will be possible for the service at Cork University Hospital to function as envisaged.  The limited service provided at present will not make an impression on the waiting list.  When I wrote to the HSE I was informed the matter could be addressed in the reconfiguration of hospital services in the HSE south area.  We do not have time for long-term planning of this nature.  The matter must be addressed immediately.I wrote to the director of Cork University Hospital, the centre that is failing to provide the necessary service, who indicated that the matter is one for the HSE.  The individuals in question are being passed from Billy to Jack because a proper service is not being provided.  The neglect of their dental heath may lead to further complications, which is a source of major frustration for parents, carers and the adults who depend on the service.I hope the Minister of State will not indicate that the issue is one to be addressed as part of a reconfiguration process and will instead outline a plan to provide some form of emergency service to accommodate the 200 or more individuals on the waiting list and relieve the awful distress they are experiencing.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I thank Deputy Clune for raising this matter, to which I will respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.It was estimated in 2007 that 43% of special care adults required either intravenous sedation or general anaesthetics for completion of their care.  Where general anaesthesia is provided, access to resources such as anaesthetists and theatre space is necessary.  Some patients, especially adult patients, who are seriously medically compromised require supporting hospital services.  In the HSE south area, Cork University Hospital, CUH, has been the principal provider of such services.  In Waterford and Wexford, local hospitals provide these services, with only the most complex cases referred to Cork University Hospital.The service in  Cork University Hospital was suspended in 2007 for safety reasons and reactivated in September 2009.  There is currently a waiting list for this service of 113 patients.  The current facility only has the capacity to meet the needs of the most urgent cases.Since August, the HSE has been working on a plan to prioritise and target vulnerable groups and those with intellectual disabilities.  A pilot initiative has been established in the HSE south area for children and adults with intellectual disabilities who require dental services.  It is expected that the outcome of this initiative will lead to a reduction of up to 50% in the current waiting lists for general anaesthetic.  The initiative takes a multifaceted approach.  I will outline the initial steps, the first of which is the reprioritisation of waiting lists.  An audit is near completion which will provide information regarding the complexity of care that patients require.  Following this, a clinical assessment will be carried out on patients.  Early results indicate that the majority of patients have moderate to mild medical complexity.  This means their dental care may be carried out in a district hospital setting.The second step is to take a two phased approach to treatment.  This will involve providing more urgent as well as less complex care.  This will mean stabilising the patients to ensure they can enter a preventative programme while awaiting treatment for any remaining oral health needs.  This is to begin in January 2011.The third step is the training and up-skilling of dental staff.  Training dental staff in relative analgesia and intravenous sedation will enable those patients who can be treated by other means to be removed from the general anaesthetic waiting list.  The training of staff will begin in spring 2011.  The HSE is also exploring the opportunities for the realignment of services in the south in order that access to other general anaesthetic facilities outside of Cork University Hospital will be available to less medically compromised patients.  The impact will be immediate since patients with less complex medical histories will be removed from the Cork University Hospital waiting list.The capacity of other hospitals is currently being determined with a view to treating patients with the least complex medical needs.  This will support the two phased approach.  As a result, in six to nine months this approach will be used to treat approximately 40% of patients on the current general anaesthetic waiting list.I thank the Deputy again for raising this matter on the Adjournment.

A person who does not satisfy the habitual residence condition is not eligible for specified social welfare payments, regardless of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.  The purpose of this condition is to safeguard the social welfare system from abuse by restricting access for people who are not economically active and who have little or no established connection with Ireland.Fewer than 1.5% of applications for carers allowance are refused on habitual residence grounds.Given the continuing rise in applications for carer's allowance there could be significant cost implications in any change to the qualifying criteria.  A proposal along the lines of that suggested by Deputy Ó Caoláin, to transfer the habitual residency requirement from the carer to the person being cared for, has previously been examined in the Department.   While such a change could be of benefit to the small number of applicants who are refused on the grounds of HRC, it would have significant administrative, financial and legal implications.  For example, it would be necessary to establish the means of a person whose centre of interest, spouse/partner, family and property are abroad, which could be difficult if not impossible.  It would transfer the burden of proving habitual residency onto the person being cared for which could lead to situations in which carers might not be eligible for carers allowance if the person for whom they care has recently arrived in Ireland; this might include elderly persons returning to be cared for by their adult children.In the light of these potential problems, I have no plans to change the current arrangements.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	470	As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach announced on 23rd March 2010 that the Department of Social and Family Affairs would be reconfigured as the Department of Social Protection with the transfer to it of a number of functions including the employment and community services programmes of FÁS and the transfer from it of functions relating to social inclusion and family supports.  The training services of FÁS will remain under the remit of my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills.  The purpose of this reorganisation is to provide a more effective and streamlined service to the unemployed by integrating the income support provided through the social welfare system with supports for activation and re-entry to employment.The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 provided the legislative basis for transferring policy and financial responsibility for the employment and community services programmes of FÁS from the Minister for Education and Skills.  It is intended to commence the relevant provisions of the Act with effect from 1 January 2011.  From that date FÁS will continue to provide these services but will do so under the direction of my Department.  The recently published Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2010 provides for the transfer of the relevant staff and related resources from FÁS to my Department.  It is intended to commence these provisions during the course of 2011 once the necessary practical arrangements have been put in place.A major programme of change is currently being developed by my Department, in close consultation with senior management in FÁS and the Department of Education and Skills, with the objective of developing a new service vision and model for the integrated Department.  The aim is to create a Department which is focused on case management rather than transaction management, activation rather than just income support and is structured around the customer rather than the schemes it delivers.  The intention being to ensure that the people can obtain the services they require, and are entitled to, in a seamless, effective and efficient way.FÁS and my Department are already working closely together and considerable progress has already been made on a number of measures to enhance the delivery of services to people on the Live Register.

This was published last October and the launch was attended by an official from my Department.  The report presents some very useful information and the updated findings will certainly be studied with interest by the Department. However this is just one of a number of research models.I fully understand that a wide range of groups — such as the unemployed, people with disabilities, carers and pensioners — depend on the welfare budget for vital support.Last year we reduced welfare payments made to people under 66.  This was necessary in order to contribute to the overall stabilisation of the public finances.  In doing so, we avoided making any change to the rate of payment to state pensioners. Including these reductions, the lowest rate of payment is still 45.4% (€61.20) higher than in 2004 while during the same period inflation has only increased by 11%.  State Pension (Contributory) and State Pension (Non Contributory) also increased by 37.7% and 42.2% respectively during this period.Consumer prices are back at April 2007 levels and we have managed to maintain payment rates higher than the rates paid in 2007, i.e. the lowest rate of social welfare is currently €10.20 higher than the rate in 2007 and the rates of State Pension (Contributory) and State Pension (Non Contributory) are also higher at €21 and €19, respectively.Despite the social welfare changes made in the last Budget, the expenditure of my Department will still increase in 2010.  Nearly €21 billion will be spent on social welfare this year or €526 million more than in 2009.The economic turmoil has resulted in a deterioration in the public finances with a large gap between the income the State earns and our level of day-to-day public spending commitments. My priority will be to ensure that the Government strategy to stabilise the financial position is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead and in this context the social welfare expenditure for 2011 will be considered for the forthcoming Budget, having regard both to needs and to the resources available to meet those needs.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 62 together.The Department of Social Protection already assists low income households with heating costs through their basic payments, through the fuel allowance scheme and through the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances.  These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.  Social welfare rates have increased at a significantly greater rate than price inflation in recent years.  Social Welfare rates have increased by between 77% and 88% since 2001 while overall inflation has increased by over 20.2% in the same period.The fuel allowance is paid for 32 weeks each year from end September to early May following an extension of the duration of the payment period by 2 weeks in Budget 2009.  In the 2010/2011 heating season it is estimated that over 350,000 recipients will benefit from the allowance at a cost of over €239 million.There are also 380,000 households, mainly older persons and persons with disabilities, in receipt of the household benefits package which provides up to 2,400 electricity units per annum (or the gas equivalent) over the year.  It is estimated that 140,000 of these households are receiving both the fuel allowance and the electricity/gas allowance under the household benefits package to assist with heating and other energy requirements.  The electricity and gas allowances under the household benefit package cost €184 million in 2009, with €225.8 million provided in 2010.  In addition, I have recently announced that the electricity allowance has been increased with effect from 1 October 2010 to cover the cost of the Public Service Obligation levy on domestic electricity, which will increase the annual cost of the scheme by €12.6 million.The Government is also committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of fuel poverty through investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock and energy efficiency awareness initiatives such as the Keep Well and Warm booklet and accompanying associated website.  Some 150,000 copies of the booklet have been distributed to date in the last couple of years.  The Warmer Homes Scheme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, is the primary mechanism for alleviating the key underlying cause of energy poverty — that of thermal inefficiency of houses.  Over 19,000 low-income houses were retrofitted in 2009 with a target of a further 22,500 in 2010.In his Carbon Budget Statement, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlined details of €130 million in funding for insulation, €76 million of which will be used to assist low income families.The significant income support measures already in place and the Government's commitment to schemes such as the warmer homes scheme and the local authority insulation scheme are concrete actions currently being taken to address fuel poverty.The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an Inter- Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy to coordinate and drive Government policy in this area. They were tasked with devising an Energy Affordability Strategy.  This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability.Any increase in expenditure on the fuel allowance scheme must be considered in the context of current financial constraints.

The Government's Green Paper on Pensions, published in 2007, acknowledges that occupational pension income for women is substantially lower than for men.  This is undoubtedly due to a number of reasons, such as the level of female participation in the labour force in the past. However, pension coverage for women has increased significantly from 40% in 1994 to 50% in 2008. In recent years, women have been one of the target groups in the National Pensions Awareness Campaign.  As the Deputy is aware, Government proposals for an auto-enrolment scheme for employees currently without access to a pension scheme will dramatically increase pension coverage rates for both men and women.A number of measures contained in the Government's National Pensions Framework are currently being developed for introduction in the short term.  Firstly, proposals to streamline the retirement options for defined contribution (DC) scheme members are currently being finalised by the Implementation Groups with a view to being brought to Government shortly.Secondly, I recently announced the fast-tracking of a proposal in the National Pensions Framework for the development of a new defined benefit model with fixed contribution rates for both employers and employees and flexible benefits, but with a level of ‘core' benefit which would have to be guaranteed.  Work on this initiative is also progressing with a view to necessary legislation being introduced by mid-2011.The proposal for a sovereign annuity scheme is being given careful consideration in both my Department and the Department of Finance.  It must be stressed that the issue is by no means straight-forward and the benefits and risks involved for all stakeholders will be fully assessed before any decision is made.

The social welfare schemes concerned are jobseeker's allowance, one parent family payment,  disability allowance, carer's allowance, widow/er's (non-contributory) pension, guardian's payment (non-contributory), State pension (non-contributory), blind pension, supplementary welfare allowance (except urgent or exceptional needs payments), domiciliary care allowance and child benefit.I am not aware of the European Commission statement as mentioned by Deputy Morgan, but I would point out that under EU law it is permissible to apply a residence test to certain non-contributory payments, such as disability allowance.  On 29th October, Commissioner Andor stated in the European Parliament that the Irish practice in relation to habitual residence is in line with the relevant EU Regulations.   However, if the Deputy wishes to provide details of the case he has in mind, I will be happy to follow up on it.The Department's guidelines are currently being reviewed with the intention of making these clearer and more user-friendly for deciding officers and customers alike.  It is planned to have the new guidelines available by the end of the year.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	475	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of the Department. Under the current arrangement where a person is not satisfied with a decision in relation to their entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance, they can appeal this decision to an Appeals Officer in the HSE. In addition, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides for a further appeal to be considered by the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  It is assumed that this is the two-step appeals process to which the Deputy refers.  The appeals process in the case of the schemes administered by the Department differs in so far as there is only one right of appeal and that is to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  However, the Department process also involves a review of the case by a deciding officer before it is forwarded to the SWAO.When the Community Welfare Service is transferred to my Department, the HSE Appeals Office will no longer have a role in relation to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Instead it is proposed that appealable decisions will be dealt with by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in the same way as for other schemes administered by my Department.The legislative provisions relating to the supplementary welfare allowance appeals process were provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007. These provisions are subject to a Commencement Order.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The scheme is intended as a temporary income support payment and is not designed to be a medium to long term housing support or a permanent solution to a person's housing needs.   Rent supplement has responded to the increased demand for income support to support accommodation costs. There are currently 96,400 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 62% since the end of December 2007.Current legislation already provides for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's request and is subject to the consent of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Approximately 20% of rent supplement payments are currently paid to a person other than the tenant.Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. To remove the right of the tenant to receive this payment by making it payable only to the landlord would require legislative amendment and I have no plans at present to make this change.Under the current arrangements, even with direct payment, landlords still have to collect the tenant contribution towards their rent (a minimum of €104 per month). The amount of rent supplement payable depends on the tenant's income; in some cases tenants pay only the minimum contribution while for others the tenant makes an additional contribution to their rent based on their financial circumstances. For example, where a person is in part-time income and receives just 10% of his or her rent directly from the State, the landlord would receive the 10% directly whilst still having to collect the 90% from the tenant.The efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected if this arrangement were to be changed, for example Community Welfare Officer's (CWOs) would potentially have a formal relationship with some 96,400 additional clients, the landlords. This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties. In particular, it would also result in CWOs being drawn into disputes between landlords and tenants.There may also be financial and control implications in cases where a tenant moves address and neither the landlord nor tenant inform the Department. Similarly, where a tenant is no longer eligible for rent supplement and the Department ceases paying the landlord, the Department may find itself involved in eviction proceedings.Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the board's dispute resolution process. It is also open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the HSE any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent. Where a CWO becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement for the purpose for which it was intended the matter is investigated.Since 2004 local authorities have specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Local authorities are now meeting the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular the rental accommodation scheme (RAS). In such cases the local authority has a direct contractual relationship with the landlord in RAS tenancies and as part of that contract the local authority pays rent directly to the landlord.The current arrangements provide tenants with flexibility in terms of location housing quality and the freedom to move to a different location whilst allowing recipients time to seek alternative long-term housing solutions provided by their local authority. The tailoring of additional payments, such as rent supplement, to meet the specific needs of individuals and making the payment direct to the tenant is regarded as an effective way of helping individuals realise their potential and take individual responsibility.

Any plans to change the child benefit and family income supplement payments are a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.The Department is currently finalising a value-for-money review in the area of child income support payments with a view to publication in the near future.  The primary Departmental programmes covered by the review are child benefit, qualified child increases to the main adult payments and family income supplement but the review also looked at other payments.  In line with the overall approach of the expenditure review process, conclusions reached in the review, while not necessarily representing Government policy in this area, can be expected to play a role in informing future policy development particularly directed at securing more coherent, effective and efficient spending of public money on families with children.Clearly child benefit, qualified child increases and family income supplement provide an important income support to families with children. However, their primary objective is not to provide support with mortgages.The Department has a scheme that provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.The mortgage interest supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  In order to qualify for mortgage interest supplement, a person must satisfy a number of statutory qualifying conditions including that the person is not engaged in full-time employment, more than 30 hours per week.  This means that persons who have suffered unemployment or had their working hours severely reduced can avail of this support.The issue of children begging is a much broader one than income support and includes child protection issues, which are matters for my colleagues the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and the Minister for Health and Children.

From January 2010 the treatments available have been limited to a free dental examination.  Current trends in 2010 indicate that around 280,000 people will receive the free dental examination.  These have been retained in order to encourage people to continue attending for checkups and help address the concerns expressed about the general dental health of the public.In addition to this, some 210,000 customers who had applied for approval to commence treatment prior to the end of 2009, either directly to the Department or through their practitioners, will receive the full range of treatments as available under the schemes prior to 1st January 2010.There is also strong evidence that increased competition in the market is having an effect on price. Shortly after the announcement of the changes to the scheme, for example, one major dental chain announced a price cut of 30%, and the Irish Dental Association (IDA) subsequently announced that its members would either freeze or reduce their prices.  Indeed I understand that recently the IDA estimated that around 50% of dentists have reduced their prices during 2010. Developments such as these are to be welcomed as they will make treatment more affordable for consumers.Tax refunds are available from the Revenue Commissioners for certain kinds of more expensive dental treatments.While a full-scale cost-benefit analysis was not possible, decisions were taken with the public health in mind. Tax refunds, enhanced competition, and the retention of free examinations all mean that routine dental care should remain affordable and widely available in Ireland.

The processing time for individual disability allowance claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the three main criteria listed above.  Certain claims have to be referred to social welfare inspectors for means investigation and this can add to the overall processing times.  In addition, factors outside the department's control can have an impact, for example, the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers or other third parties.The volume of disability allowance claims has increased in recent years as the scheme rules changed to, for example, extend eligibility to persons in residential care and to persons aged 16-18 whose family were previously in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  The general growth in the population and the relatively beneficial terms available to disability allowance applicants, compared to other EU countries, have also had an impact on this growth.  Going forward, my Department is addressing the challenge posed by this increased level of activity by deploying new computerised processing systems.In the meantime, measures taken to reduce delays in claim processing include an increase in the number of claims being desk assessed thus reducing the number of cases being referred for investigation by social welfare inspectors.  Since August 2009 all claims are now being desk assessed by medical assessors to determine medical suitability, ongoing review of existing processes and procedures and the approval of overtime working.In the meantime, people who have urgent income support needs can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) from their local community welfare officer.The department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  Operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed in all areas of the department, including disability allowance section, to ensure that claims are processed and decided in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.

Customers claiming jobseeker's allowance may have to be interviewed by an inspector at the beginning of their claim and at any subsequent review of their means.  Once a customer is three months on the Live Register, he or she will be selected for interview by FÁS under the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) and may also be interviewed or elect to consult with the job facilitator at any stage during their claim. The Department refers a number of people that have been through the NEAP process to facilitators on a monthly basis.  For entitlement to a jobseeker scheme, the customer must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  As part of the normal control process, a future review date is entered on the payment system for all jobseeker customers. Additional review dates are entered, as necessary, throughout the life of the claim. At each date the claim is reviewed and, where necessary, the customer is interviewed to ensure that he or she continues to satisfy the conditions of the scheme.The current system of interviews and consultations provides the Department with opportunities to assess a customer's commitment to seek work and his/her availability for work.  In addition, it provides customers with opportunities to discuss the employment and education opportunities available to them at various points in their claim.  The current arrangements are kept under review.

This represents a 120% increase since the end of 2008 when there were 8,100 recipients.The Department's review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was published in July 2010 in conjunction with the interim report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group.  The main purpose of the Department's review was to examine how the scheme could continue to meet its primary objective of catering for those who require short-term assistance. The review group included representatives from my Department, the Community Welfare Service, the Departments of Finance and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, together with a representative from the Office of the Financial Regulator. The Review is available on the Department's website.The MIS review makes a number of recommendations centred on the delivery of significant customer service improvement by ensuring that State support for those unable to deal with mortgage arrears is better targeted, consistent and easily understood. Allied with the focus on customer service improvement are recommendations that seek to ensure that lending institutions, borrowers and the Exchequer share responsibilities and commitments in a balanced way.The key proposals of the Department's mortgage interest supplement review are as follows:1. Mortgage interest supplement will become a time bound payment.2. To remove the ‘30 hour rule' — this will allow couples / single people who, due to the economic downturn, have suffered a significant loss of income and now find themselves in a distressed mortgage and require MIS support. Under current rules, due to these people working a full working week they would not be entitled to MIS.3. The rule excluding mortgage interest supplement where a property is offered for sale is unduly restrictive in the current market and should be suspended and re-introduced when the housing market recovers.4. Mortgage interest supplement should not be provided where repayments of the capital element of the loan are being made to the lender. This will insure the borrower is not placed under additional financial stress.5. The applicant should be afforded a six month period of forbearance with the lender before the State intervenes in providing mortgage interest supplement.6. Mortgage interest supplement should not be payable in respect of any housing loans of other State agencies or housing authorities.7. Successful applicants must be assisted to ensure that their long term housing support needs, if any, are met prior to the cessation of mortgage interest supplement payment.My Department is currently developing an implementation plan that will set out a framework for the future of the mortgage interest supplement scheme. This plan will incorporate the recommendations and findings from my Department's mortgage interest supplement review and from the two reports from the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group whose final report was published on the 17th November 2010.

In this regard, the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has primary responsibility in this area is liaising with my department.  Ireland has been generally supportive of EU initiatives to enhance the minimum level of protection for pregnant workers and is committed to supporting gender equality and ensuring there is a high participation by women in the labour force. Current national provisions extend well beyond the current minimum requirements at EU level of 14 weeks for maternity leave. Maternity leave of 26 weeks is provided for, during which maternity benefit may be paid at the rate of between €225 and €270 per week. A further 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave may also be taken.

The emphasis is to minimise risks of fraud and eliminate incorrect payments.  A four-pronged control strategy has been adopted by my Department, namely prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage, early detection through effective review of claims in payment, measures to deter fraud, and the pursuit and recovery of overpayments.   The increase in the levels of people unemployed arising from the economic turmoil, poses challenges for the prevention and effective management of fraud and control.  My Department's response to these challenges has been to introduce new measures, which are evidence based, to target control activity at high risk categories of claimants.Overpayments raised by my Department are categorised as ‘Fraud', ‘Non-Fraud' or ‘Estate' cases.  ‘Estate' cases arise where undisclosed means by customers (usually pensioners) come to light after their deaths.  ‘Non Fraud' cases are primarily due to customer or third party error, with some due to departmental error.  ‘Fraud' cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income and family status.The overpayments reported in the year 2009 are as follows:FraudCustomer/ Third Party ErrorDepartmental ErrorEstateTotalTotal 2009 overpayments€20,200,506.13€30,831,055.103,856,763.78€10,622,808.64€65,511,133.65Overpayments arise in relation to past events where a deciding officer has sufficient evidence that a person has been paid an amount in excess of their entitlement for a given period, either through payment at a rate above that which they should receive or where they are paid beyond the relevant date.  As such, overpayments reported in 2009 will not exclusively represent suspected fraudulent activities of that year.I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  In this regard, the control programme of my Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are refined to ensure that they remain effective. Fraud detection measures have increased and improved significantly over the last number of years and will be continuously reviewed to prioritise resources towards achieving results.

In an uncertain economic environment, my priority will be to ensure that the Government strategy to stabilise the financial position is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 228 together.The Department has developed, in conjunction with a number of other Government Departments, the specifications for a Public Services Card (PSC) under the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, or SAFE, programme.  The specification provides for identification features, including a photograph.  The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.Legislative provisions in relation to the introduction of the Public Services Card have been included in Section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended by Section 32 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007). The recently published Social Welfare Bill provides for a number of amendments to this legislation including the addition of place of birth and nationality to the data set to be encoded on the chip.Over the past few years significant progress had been made on the implementation of the project including the selection of a preferred bidder to provide a managed service for card production and related bureau services.  Technical specifications were finalised and the necessary organisational change was designed.However, in view of the uncertain economic climate, the project was suspended until formal sanction to proceed was received from the Department of Finance at the end of last year.  A contract was agreed with the managed service provider from early January.The remaining elements of the project commenced at that time.  Significant work has been undertaken since then including decisions regarding the final design of the card and the development of a secure site for the personalisation of the cards.  It is also necessary to develop a technical infrastructure within the Department to support the management and administration of the cards.  Some of this development is being undertaken internally while procurement for the remainder is underway.At the moment it is expected that the card production capability will be ready in December.  Following implementation of the necessary registration infrastructure, including staff training, card issue for customers of the Department will commence early in 2011.The overall timeframe for completion of initial deployment of a Public Services Card is dependent on the rate at which it will be possible to securely register all of those to whom it will be issued.  Initial registration will be carried out in the Department.  Other options that may exist for external registration are being explored.The Public Services Card will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel card, with highly secure cards.Features such as photographs and signatures and electronic card authentication are expected to minimise the rate of fraud and error arising from incorrectly identified and authenticated individuals.A further benefit of the Public Services Card will be the efficiencies that can be achieved by all agencies and customers using the card.  The time spent on establishing identity and authentication will be reduced on both sides, leading to significant potential savings nationally.

In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists.  One of the measures introduced to address the issue of long-term rent supplementation is the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) which gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for eighteen months or more.Rent supplement is not payable where a person or their spouse or partner is in full-time employment, that is for 30 hours or more a week. However, provision was made in 2007 whereby a person on rent supplement, who is accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS, may return to full-time work, subject to a means test, without losing entitlement to their rent supplement payment.The 30-hour per week limit has been in place since 1977 when the SWA scheme came into operation. The use of 30 hours as the part-time limit for SWA is designed to be as advantageous as possible to individuals returning to the employment market without including those in full-time employment, thus reflecting the scheme's original purpose of a short-term income support payment. Support for those in full-time employment and who require long term housing support is provided by local authority housing initiatives which include RAS and other social housing placement schemes. I have no plans to remove the 30 hour rule for the rent supplement scheme.

The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents", which was published in 2006, proposed that the category of lone parenthood would be abolished.  Instead, a parental allowance would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner) with young children on a low income, thus ending the co-habitation rule. It will not be possible for my Department to progress this aspect of the proposal due, in part, to the current economic climate.These proposals have, however, informed deliberations regarding the One-Parent Family Payment scheme.The current duration of the One-Parent Family Payment, which is payable until the youngest child in a lone parent family reaches the age of 18 years — or 22 years if in full-time education — is not in the best interests of the recipient, their children or society.Social welfare supports for lone parents should be designed to:prevent long-term dependence on social welfare supports and facilitate financial independence;recognise parental choice with regard to the care of young children but with the expectation that parents will not remain outside of the labour force indefinitely, andinclude an expectation of participation in education, training and employment, with supports provided in this regard.To meet these social policy objectives, my Department has introduced changes to the One-Parent Family Payment in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2010.  For new customers, from April 2011, the One-Parent Family Payment will be paid until the youngest child in the family reaches the age of 14 years.  For existing recipients of the payment, there will be a six-year phasing-out period to enable them to access education and training and to prepare them for their return to the labour market.  Special provisions will be made for families with children for whom the Domiciliary Care Allowance is paid and for the recently bereaved (both married and co-habiting).These changes will bring Ireland's support for lone parents more in line with international provisions, where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support.

The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment (including family income supplement), or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.  The purpose of the household income limit is to ensure that the allowance is directed at those with the greatest need.In my reply to the previous parliamentary question I outlined that my Department established a Working Group to undertake a review of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme as part of its Expenditure Review Programme.  The Working Group published its report in August 2004.  That review concluded that payment rates did not warrant adjustment at that time.The most recent Consumer Price Index figures show that clothing and footwear costs have:Fallen by 7.4% in the last 12 monthsFallen by 27.6% since December 2006Fallen by 38.1% since December 2001Despite these reductions significant improvement have been made to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme over the last number of years:Since 2006 the rates of payment have increased from €80 to €200 for children aged 2-11 and for children aged 12-22 they have increased from €115 to €305. In addition, the allowance was increased by €215 to €520 per annum payable for eligible 18 year olds, as a compensatory measure where child benefit is no longer payable.In Budget 2009, there was an increase of €50 in the income thresholds for entitlement to back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  This has brought the income limits for the allowance for couples with one child to €563.60 and €410.10 for those parenting alone.  In addition the limit is increased by €29.80 for each additional child. The Government has provided €82 million for the scheme this year — an increase of €59 million since 2006Given these significant improvements to the scheme in recent years it is very clear that the adequacy of the payment is not decided on the basis of a report published in 2004.

Legally, the Exchequer is the residual financier of the fund and Exchequer contributions were the norm for over forty years — for example, in 1967, the State contribution was 38% of SIF expenditure and almost 29% in 1985. However, no Exchequer contribution was required between 1996 and 2009 as the fund was in surplus on foot of contributions from employers and workers.

Each local office has officers who are dedicated to providing information and are available to explain supports and services to people.  Information officers provide a range of information to customers on their entitlements including, in broad terms, the effect that taking up work may have on their social welfare payments.There is also a network of 67 facilitators at local level in the Department.  Facilitators work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that the individual has and ultimately improve their employment chances, as well as help them to continue to develop personally.  They work in close co-operation with other agencies and service providers including FÁS, VEC, other education and training providers and the local and community and voluntary sector.  In addition they provide advice and support to customers who wish to access the back to education scheme, the back to work scheme, and the short term enterprise allowance scheme of the Department.The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.  In the period January to end of August 2010 (the latest period for which data are available to this Department), a total of 60,797 persons were referred to FÁS — this is an increase of 9% (4,914) over the same period in 2009. 46,146 (76%) were interviewed by FÁS and 9,489(16%) were placed in jobs, training or education.The locally-based service in operation in the Department's network of local and branch offices is supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.The Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets and these are available in a wide range of outlets, including Social Welfare Offices, Citizens Information Centres and Post Offices.  Leaflets can also be requested through the Department's website.The Department's website, www.welfare.ie, contains full information on its range of schemes and services, including jobseekers supports, and has a ‘Frequently Asked Questions' section dedicated to Jobseekers; this section of the site is available in English, Irish and Polish and provides answers to some of the most common queries the Department receives on topics such as taxation of benefits and on options available regarding training, employment, self-employment and voluntary work.The employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme, which was launched on June 21st this year, is prominently advertised on the website's home page.  The Department also operates a PRSI mailing list via its website, and almost four thousand subscribers, primarily employers and tax practitioners, receive emails on PRSI changes each year.Jobseeker customers can now close their claim online and customers doing so are provided with a link to a dedicated page, listing the supports that may be available to them on return to the workforce, such as Family Income Supplement, Money Advice and Budgeting Service, etc.Funding is also provided annually to the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed (INOU) to produce their booklet "Working for Work", which contains full information on jobseekers payments, the training and development options available to jobseekers as well as advice on job searching, tax and other social services provided by other Departments and agencies.  INOU provides free copies of the "Working for Work" booklet to people in receipt of social welfare payments.The Citizens Information Board, which comes under the aegis of the Department, is the national information agency with responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information and advice on the broad range of social services including social welfare services.  Information is provided through Citizen Information Centres and other offices throughout the country, through the Citizens Information Phone Service (1890 777 121) which operates from 9am to 9pm Monday to Friday and on their website at www.citizensinformation.ie.  The Citizens Information Board recently launched a new website dedicated to people recently made unemployed, called www.losingyourjob.ie.  This site provides a single point of information for anyone looking for assistance with unemployment or reduced hours.The Department will continue to increase and improve the channels through which it delivers information services to all its customers.

To this end, operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are reviewed in all areas of the Department.  These reviews are supported by modern technology, the potential of which is continuously harnessed.  Claims are processed in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria.  For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes; medical examinations are required for some of the illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  In the case of the insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.The main impact on service delivery has arisen due to the increase in the Live Register which increased from 240,200 at September 2008 to 419,800 at September 2009 and 442,400 at September 2010.  In response, all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims has been examined and streamlined wherever possible.  In this context, the Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives regarding claims for jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit.  One of the most significant initiatives, aimed at reducing queuing times and waiting times, involves the customer attending their local office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.In addition, a range of other process improvements have been introduced which include:A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseeker's allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires;A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years;Application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department's website.  This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps reduce queuing times;More straightforward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced;The Department has also simplified processing methods for some customers who work casually, part-time or on systematic short-time work.Since May 2008, 766 staff have been assigned to my Department, mainly through the transfer and redeployment of staff from other Government Departments.  The staff assigned have filled additional posts and critical vacancies in local offices, support units, scheme areas and the Department's inspectorate.  Some of these posts were sourced through a staff levy imposed on other Government Departments in April 2009.A number of initiatives have also been put in place to enhance the capacity of the Social Welfare Appeals Office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:3 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office since January 2009,A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,The organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity,A project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented, andSignificant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.Eight experienced retired Appeals Officers have been re-employed on a part-time basis since July 2010.In conclusion, I wish to assure Deputies that service delivery remains a key priority in my Department and that processes are kept under continuous review to ensure that services are delivered promptly to customers.  Staffing needs are also kept under constant review to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.

The period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment before accessing BTEA was reduced from 12 months to 9 months (a 2 year qualifying period continues to apply to participants coming from Illness Benefit).  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  In addition, a person in certain circumstances can avail of BTEA to resume studies in a second or subsequent year of a third level course whereas prior to July, a person could only apply for BTEA if s/he was commencing year one of a course.The back to education scheme covers courses of education from second level to higher diploma level in any discipline [level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)] and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching; level 9 in NFQ) which add significantly to a person's employability.  BTEA will not usually be approved if a person holds a qualification equivalent or higher than the qualification for which the application has been received.  Other postgraduate qualifications (level 9 or level 10) are not included.However, a small number of cases have arisen where a college has granted an exemption from the requirement to hold a primary degree and has admitted a person to a Master's course on the basis of relevant life experience. In the context of the ongoing monitoring of the operation of the scheme, it has been decided to extend entitlement to the Back to Education Allowance in these instances on an exceptional basis.The focus of the Back to Education Allowance is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system. People in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a high level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects.  Furthermore, the scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.

As I indicated in a recent reply on this issue, preliminary work has been undertaken by the Department in relation to this matter.  The issues involved are complex, since there could, for instance, be negative impacts on economic competitiveness and negative downstream costs for employers and employees in terms of increased insurance premia in respect of employer liability, public liability and transport cover.  Against that background, the introduction of any changes in this area would necessitate extensive consultations with a wide range of interested parties, including not only representatives of the insurance industry, but also the legal profession and employers representatives amongst others, in order to assess adequately all of the possible implications and to comply with formal Regulatory Impact Assessment requirements.In view of these wider potential implications, it is my intention to consult with my Government colleagues with a view to securing agreement on the most appropriate course of action in relation to this matter.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently over 96,400 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of 62% since the end of 2007.  Over 44,500 have been in payment for 18 months or more.The rental accommodation scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities. Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including: the traditional social housing, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS.Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show that a total of 30,008 transfers from rent supplement to local authorities have occurred since 2005: 16,696 rent supplement recipients to RAS and a further 13,312 recipients to other social housing options.It is accepted that progress in relation to RAS was initially slower than expected. However the pace of delivery has improved significantly.  In total, 14,000 recipients were transferred to RAS and social housing in 2008 and 2009; achieving targets set for RAS transfers for these years. The target established for 2010 is for a further 8,000 rent supplement tenants to be provided with a housing solution by local authorities.In consultation with the Department, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has approved a number of pilot programmes in different local authorities to increase the flow of transfers. These include allowing applicants for RAS to seek out their own properties which, subject to compliance with the normal conditions and the agreement of the landlord, may then be taken into the leasing programme. Approved housing bodies under the leasing initiative have also been advised that they can source applicants for social housing support from long-term rent supplement tenancies also.The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is represented on a number of RAS implementation groups. The purpose of these Groups is to ensure that the RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.

These reductions were made as part of the overall objective to reduce public expenditure and restore stability to the public finances.  In the Supplementary Budget in 2009 and in Budget 2010, changes were also introduced in the level of weekly payments for new recipients of jobseeker's allowance aged under 25.  The new reduced rates were introduced in order to incentivise younger jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and try to prevent their becoming welfare dependent from a young age.Affected persons who participate in a FÁS or similar training/education course get the full rate of the relevant payment (e.g. FÁS training allowance, Community Employment rate, Back to Education Allowance), instead of a reduced Jobseekers' Allowance and this provides a major incentive for such participation.Recipients of jobseekers' payments are obliged to advise my Department of any employment or self-employment they engage in as such participation in the workforce may affect their continuing entitlement to a jobseekers' payment or the level of payment. Failure to report any employment or self-employment is a serious matter and my Department has a range of control measures in place to prevent and detect such abuses of the welfare system.

The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Similarly, mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.Significant improvements to the means test for rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement were implemented in 2007.  The assessment of means for these schemes now provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive a rent or mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Since June 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.

Information on the scheme is available on the Department's website www.welfare.ie and also on the FÁS website.  The main information web page on this scheme on the Department's website was viewed 10,790 times between 21 June and 12 November 2010.  There have also been a number of press releases in relation to the scheme.In addition, information regarding the scheme was circulated through a number of agencies including Forfás, the Small firms Association and IBEC. Information was also disseminated to the 3,754 people who have subscribed (free of charge) to the Department of Social Protection's PRSI mailing list. This mailing list primarily comprises employers and tax practitioners. Up to 19 November 2010, applications were received from 849 employers in respect of 1,567 employees. 616 employers have been awarded exemptions in respect of 1,028 employees. 274 employers have had claims in respect of 391 employees rejected.An additional 103 employers have applied for exemptions in respect of 148 employees. Employers have been contacted to provide information or clarifications in relation to 102 of these employees which will allow their claims to be progressed to a decision. There are further applications in respect of the remaining 46 employees on hands.The scheme is open to employers who create new and additional jobs in 2010. Successful applicants are exempted from liability to pay their share of PRSI for certain employees for 12 months from the date they are approved for the scheme. Extension of the scheme into 2011 is a matter for the Government to consider in a budgetary context.

The mortgage interest supplement scheme provides short term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the portion of the mortgage repayments only.Under the  supplementary welfare allowance scheme an exceptional needs payment may be made to help meet an essential, once off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.The purpose of the back to school allowance is to help towards the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear at the beginning of the school year.  The scheme is administered by the Health Service Executive and operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year.Social welfare expenditure for 2011 will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget, having regard both to needs and to the resources available to meet those needs.  In an uncertain economic environment, my priority will be to ensure that the Government strategy to stabilise the financial position is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	501	As a result of the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure separate programme funding for the work of the Ireland Newfoundland Partnership and the Active Citizenship Office ceased in 2009.  The separate Offices in these areas have been discontinued which has given rise to savings on my Department's Vote of approximately €308,000 per annum.  The National Forum on Europe was closed in 2009 which also gave rise to savings of €515,000.In addition there has been significant savings in the National Economic and Social Development Office.  On 1st April 2010, an Order was made under Section 34 of the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006, which dissolved the National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance (NCPP).   As a result of this rationalisation, the budget for NESDO in 2010 was reduced by 34% from €5.059 million to €3.332 million, with potential for further significant administrative savings once the restructuring is implemented.The CSO are implementing the recommendations of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure and are fully achieving the Special Group's savings targets.  The restructuring savings are being achieved by a range of initiatives including a new organisation structure, consolidation of facilities management and re-engineering of business surveys.The report recommends reducing the Census 2011 costs.  Savings will arise primarily in 2011 and will be achieved by a range of actions including reduction in administration, advertising and field collection costs.  These planned savings on the Census cost will be incorporated into the CSO 2011 estimates.The McCarthy Group recommended that the Law Reform Commission, which is funded through the Vote of the Attorney General, be discontinued and that work on the Legislation Directory and on Statute Law Restatements currently undertaken by the Commission be transferred to the Office of the Attorney General, along with staff and relevant funds.An alternative proposal from the Attorney General was subsequently accepted to the effect that the Commission's annual budget would be reduced by 33% and this recommendation has now been implemented.The report recommended that the Chief State Solicitor's Office should seek further reductions in expert witness fees and professional fees.  The Office and the Department of Finance responded to these recommendations in framing the 2010 Estimate for the Office, which shows a €1.8m reduction over the 2009 Estimate.In common with all Departments and Offices, there has already been a reduction in staff numbers arising from Government policies introduced.  In my Department the number of whole time equivalent staff employed has reduced by 10% since the end of 2008.In summary, I can assure the House that my Department will make significant savings on expenditure in 2010, and that this process will be managed so as to minimise the disruption to the very valuable public services they provide.

Subject to the conditions of the individual schemes, free tuition and grants are available where students are progressing to a course at a higher level.The main objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in progressing, where appropriate, to a postgraduate course of study.Given the level of demand on the student grant schemes budget from first time students and students that are progressing with their studies to a higher level, there are no plans at present to change the terms and conditions of the schemes.However, State support is available for students pursing a second course at the same level.  In this regard, Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges and universities in the State and any other EU Member State. This relief also extends to approved post-graduate courses in non- EU member states.  Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.

There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	514	The Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) was introduced to schools in 1995 and now caters for approximately 7% of the overall student cohort. Participation in recent years is as follows:YearNo. of Schools offering LCALCA Enrolment (2 year cohort)2009/102906,8832008/92937,0972007/82967,4362006/72937,4982005/62907,414The LCA is a two-year programme designed for those students who do not wish to proceed directly to higher education or for those whose needs, aptitudes and learning styles are not fully catered for by the other two Leaving Certificate programmes. The programme offers integrated general education, vocational preparation and training and work experience.  It does not provide for direct entry to higher education, but students can enter Post Leaving Certificate courses and progress from there to higher education.An ESRI report "Engaging Young People? — Student experiences of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme", was published in April 2010. It highlights that the LCA is targeted at students in the lower socio-economic groups who struggle with schoolwork, have had negative educational experiences in junior cycle, experience behavioural problems, wish to enter the labour market on leaving school, or have special needs. The study shows that the programme can act as a safety net for those at risk of early school leaving. Students are positive about the interactive teaching style in the programme, the practical focus, small class sizes, work experience, completion of tasks for assessment throughout the cycle and the provision for accumulation of credits.  The programme also has higher rates of entry to Post Leaving Certificate programmes than is the case for other leavers, and higher rates of entry into employment. However, 18% of LCA leavers in 2005 were unemployed, compared with 11% of other Leaving Certificate leavers.The study raises questions as to whether the process of tracking students into a differentiated curriculum in senior cycle which attracts a distinct social profile acts as a safety net and an effective progression route, or whether it reinforces inequity, and limits opportunity. The study  recommends that the ring-fenced nature of LCA should be re-examined and students should be allowed to take subjects within the established Leaving Certificate as well as LCA options.  The report was commissioned by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and the issues raised are being examined as part of the ongoing review of senior cycle.It must be borne in mind that the Leaving Certificate Applied is designed to address the needs of students who would not be progressing directly to higher education, and for whom the flexibility offered by LCA programmes is more suited to their needs than the established Leaving certificate programmes. I am convinced that LCA offers an integrated and coherent programme of learning which effectively reaches its target group, and has succeeded in providing a positive and motivating experience for many students who might otherwise be at risk of disengagement  from school, or early school leaving.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	515	As the Deputy may be aware over €92m has been provided to primary and post primary schools in ICT grants in the past 12 months as part of this Government's commitment to ICT in education.  Schools are requested to prioritise the purchase of computers for use by teachers and digital projectors.  Once schools have the recommended baseline in place they may purchase a wide range of ICT equipment such as visualisers and interactive whiteboards.Schools are required to carry out purchases in line with public procurement rules.  In this regard existing ICT Purchasing Frameworks must be engaged with and taken advantage of, for the purchase of PCs, notebooks, laser printers, and digital projectors. These Frameworks simplify the process of purchasing ICT equipment for schools. If, having reviewed the market and considered comparative technical specifications, warranties and associated supports schools have satisfied themselves that better value for money may be achieved from non-Framework vendors in a given case, then schools may seek concurrent quotes from both Framework and non-Framework vendors ensuring that identical specification options, and warranties are presented to all vendors at the time of request for written quotations.In relation to reconditioned equipment, schools should be aware that refurbished computers must be of a certain minimum specification and carry a suitable technical support warranty to ensure that they function effectively in schools over a significant period of time. Reliability and confidence in a computer's functionality are essential given the time constraints in the classroom. The National Centre for Technology in Education which advises my Department on ICT Policy for schools is of the view that the minimum PC specification should incorporate a relatively fast processor, a minimum of 2GB of memory, 40GB disk drive and, most importantly, a 3 year on-site warranty on both parts and labour to ensure that any computer component failures are addressed. Feedback from schools to the National Centre for Technology in Education indicates that lower grade refurbished PCs can cause an undue technical support burden on schools and a higher than expected total cost of ownership.  Where the refurbished PC meets the recommended specification, and where the schools makes an informed choice my Department supports the use of quality refurbished computers in schools.

Parents/Guardians have a responsibility to ensure that their children are brought safely to and collected safely from designated pick up and set down points.There is no provision within the scheme to facilitate pupils with pick up or set down points on existing bus routes other than those designated by Bus Éireann.

Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.The Deputy will be aware that in 2005 the school was selected as one which was suitable for delivery of a building project under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme and the school authority was offered funding of €300,000 to build an extension. The school authority accepted this offer and proceeded with the planning of this project while, at the same time, appealing the amount allocated to the project under the scheme.Subsequently, having considered their options, the school authority notified the Department that they had decided to withdraw from the scheme as they deemed the existing site of 1.2 acres to be insufficient to cater for the extension. They requested that they be considered for inclusion in the main programme for delivery by the traditional method, in line with the project's priority band rating and the Patron offered adjacent parish land.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.In the meantime, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department approved funding in the amount of €51,179.94 towards sewerage works and €5,500 towards roof repairs in 2007 and 2010 respectively.  In addition, my Department recently approved funding towards the provision of a resource room for special needs purposes and the school authority has been advised accordingly.

It was also felt that an urban/rural mix could be achieved by ensuring that an adequate number of places were available to the provincial locations. Additionally, it was felt that all counties should be represented in the pilot project. Whilst geographical location was used as the starting point in deciding the selection of schools for progress to stage 2, the working group examined each location with the other criteria in mind. Accordingly, in order to achieve excellent VFM with regard to both backhaul and infrastructure investment, the working group decided to locate a significant number of the provincial locations in places where HEAnet has a major point of presence (PoP) and a contractual agreement to access the PoP.The working group decided that the following regions should be included for participation in the pilot project:Dublin;Cork;Limerick;Athlone;Galway;Letterkenny;Waterford;Dundalk;Tipperary.The remaining places were reserved for locations outside these areas that satisfied specific requirements of the pilot project.Technology Mix:The working group wanted to ensure that all technologies that can deliver a 100Mbit/s connection would be tested during the demonstration project. It was decided that areas within a 30km radius of HEAnet PoPs would satisfy this requirement.  Accordingly, all schools located within this radius for each of the eight PoPs were identified.In the Dublin area, it was anticipated that a variety of access technologies could connect the selected schools. As such, the working group were of the opinion that the telecommunications market in Dublin was sufficiently developed to allow a mix of bandwidth technologies to be proposed without the need for further intervention by the working group. The working group decided that the schools in Dublin should, where possible, include five schools from each of the local authorities.Social Inclusion:The working group wanted to ensure that specific communities could be included in the project from a social inclusion perspective. This criterion ensures that island, rural and DEIS schools were included in the project.Adequate Mix of Schools:While prioritising schools with a significant student population under the criteria set out above, the working group endeavoured to ensure that an adequate mix of schools were also chosen to be invited to participate in the demonstration project. Consequently, a number of schools were selected with reference to the following selection criteria:Schools with a large cohort of students with special educational needs;Post Leaving Certificate Schools;Gaelscoileanna/Gaeltacht Schools;ICT Adoption;Gender mix;Rural/urban mix;Schools type;Size of school.STAGE 2Stage 2 of the selection process sought to ensure that the schools shortlisted from Stage 1 had the commitment, infrastructure and support to realize the potential of 100Mbit/s bandwidth. Shortlisted schools were invited to apply for inclusion in the project outlining how participation in the project would support their e-learning plan, and what would be required of them in being involved in the project. The working group felt a range of schools with differing levels of ICT usage and infrastructure would be desirable in the project.  Schools had to agree to the project commitments to qualify for the project.3 sub criteria were identified under stage 2 of the selection process as set out:Current structures and Infrastructure;Usage of internet for learning and teaching, including any projects; andCommitment to the project requirements over the next 2 years.Current Structures and Infrastructure:The working group wanted to ensure that all schools qualified from Stage 1 would be examined with regard to their ability to utilise the proposed connection as quickly as possible. It was proposed to focus on the schools individual e-learning team and plan, current ICT infrastructure (specifically devices) and teachers ICT proficiency.Usage of internet for learning and teaching, including any projects:The working group wanted to ensure that the schools invited to participate in the project had a digital agenda with regard to ICT within the learning and teaching environment.From a project feasibility point of view, all schools identified as suitable for participation in the pilot were subject to examination with regard to cost effectiveness and the ability to deliver the required infrastructure within budgetary constraints.

The Commission is due to report to me shortly at which time I will have to consider the policy matters and necessary arrangements and revised procedures that will need to be put in place.The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection and with reference to recent schools' enrolment data.The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected enrolments at primary level increase from the current total enrolment of circa 505,600 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 563,300 pupils by the year 2016.

In that regard, the Framework includes proposals for, among other things, a new supplementary pension scheme based on "auto-enrolment" for those without private pension arrangements where part of the State contribution would be the equivalent of 33% tax relief. In addition, the same level of State contribution or 33% tax relief is proposed to replace marginal income tax relief for existing contributors to pension savings.The Government made clear in the Framework that the introduction of the new  auto-enrolment scheme (targeted for 2014) would depend on prevailing economic conditions. Further details on the Government's position in this general area will be set out in the Four Year Plan to be published tomorrow.

The new scheme is aimed at securing considerable long-term Exchequer savings, while continuing to offer fair and reasonable pensions to retired public servants. Its principal features will include career-average benefit accrual, inflation-indexation of benefits and an increased pension age. The Government considers these features to be important and appropriate.  Extensive consultations on the proposed new scheme with Government Departments and with the staff side have in fact taken place over the past 18 months. Draft legislation to introduce the new scheme is currently in preparation, and it is planned that the scheme will be operational in 2011.My Department is aware of the report by Trident Consulting entitled "Future Pension Provision" which was commissioned by the three teachers unions, ASTI, INTO and the TUI. In addition, my Department is aware of the views of these unions concerning the Government's planned introduction of a single pension scheme for all new-entrant public servants.  The Trident Report was made available to officials of my Department and was the subject of a specific meeting between my officials and the teachers unions.I do not accept that single scheme members will make contributions in excess of the value of their benefits.  In this context I would note that the pension-related deduction is not a pension contribution, this is set out in section 7(2) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.I welcome the Trident Report as a contribution to the debate on pension provision.  However the Report's recommended approaches to pension provision differs in fundamental respects with the Government's policy and I cannot accept the Report as a policy basis for pension provision for new-entrant teachers at this time.

A regional application was made as the estimate of the extent of the damage does not meet the Solidarity Fund's threshold of 0.6% of GNI or 935.5m euro for a national disaster.  Some 111.5m euro of the 276.9m euro costs to the State were eligible for assistance under the EU Solidarity Fund criteria or 21.4% of total direct costs. This included damage to roads, infrastructure, the provision of temporary accommodation and the costs incurred by the rescue services.The Commission informed the Department on 14th September 2010 that it is proposing financial aid amounting to 13.02m euro in response to Ireland's application to the EU Solidarity Fund. This amount will now have to be confirmed by the European Parliament and the European Council by way of an amending budget procedure.  The funds received will be used to recoup in part the significant expenditure incurred by the State in responding to the emergency. As soon as the budget appropriations become available, consultation will begin with the relevant Departments and local authorities to determine how the money will be recouped to them.As part of the expenditure incurred by the State, the Government funded the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme which is operated by the Department of Social Protection. The scheme was administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social Protection. The scheme, which is means tested, provided emergency financial assistance to households who were not in a position to meet costs for essential needs in the period immediately following flooding. The scheme covered emergency income support payments to those in need and damage to a person's home and its basic essential contents, such as: carpets, flooring, furniture, household appliances and bedding and structural damage where appropriate.

The relief also applies to the disposal by an individual of all or part of the shares of a company, which is both a farming company and the individual's family company.  Finally, the relief is also available for certain assets owned by the individual but used by the individual's farming company.Full relief is available where the proceeds from the disposal do not exceed €750,000. If the proceeds exceed €750,000, marginal relief may apply.  In order to qualify for the relief, the individual must be at least 55 years of age and must have owned and used the assets for a period of ten years prior to the disposal or, in certain circumstances, prior to the letting of land for farming purposes.  Where the disposal is of shares in a farming company, the company must have been a farming company and the individual's family company during a period of not less than ten years ending on the date of disposal.  Moreover, in such cases, the individual must have been a working director of the company for a period of not less than ten years during which he/she must have been a full-time working director for not less than five years.The relief is confined to assets used for the purpose of farming.  For this reason, shares or securities or other assets held as investments are explicitly excluded from the scope of the relief.  As the shares in question are not assets used for the purposes of farming, they are, accordingly, excluded from the relief and any gain on their disposal is liable to Capital Gains Tax.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for collection and recovery of a wide range of taxes and duties including VAT. Revenue expects businesses, notwithstanding the difficult economic and financial circumstances in which they are operating, to organise their financial affairs so as to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. Apart from the critical importance of timely compliance to the Exchequer, unfair competitive advantage achieved through persistent late or non-payment of tax undermines compliant businesses.  I fully support what Revenue are doing in that regard.Revenue has encouraged early engagement with them by businesses experiencing particular challenges in being compliant with a view to facilitating the putting in place of an agreed approach to the management of those challenges. Revenue's objective is to confirm the basic viability of such businesses and to secure timely compliance and payment of any tax debt in the shortest possible timeframe.Arising from amendments in the Finance Acts, Revenue introduced a scheme in 2006 and 2007 for smaller PAYE/PRSI and VAT registered customers that reduced the frequency of tax returns and payments required of such businesses.  Smaller businesses benefit from the less frequent filing and payment facility under the scheme through improved cash flow and reduced costs of administration.  I am satisfied that the overall approach to small businesses in relation to their obligations to pay VAT as reflected in the measures outlined, are of importance and considerable help in the current difficult trading environment.With regard to small businesses paying rates, I have been informed by my Colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley T.D., that local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  However, the Minister has urged local authorities to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in this and previous years and they have responded positively in this regard. Across the 88 local authorities, the average change of ARV from 2009 to 2010 shows a decrease of 0.62%.  As part of a range of measures to aid economic recovery, the Minister is clear on the need for continued reductions in commercial rates over the coming years.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I understand that the Deputy's question relates to large, globally active, investment firms.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment directly on the Deputy's concerns as set out in his question in the absence of more specific information on the issues to which it might relate.However, I would like to advise the Deputy of a number of important initiatives that have taken place at EU and international level to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework for international financial firms and in particular in relation to the regulation of hedge funds and proposed restrictions on short-selling in light of some of the lessons learned from the international financial crisis.  The Deputy may be aware that the G20 agreed on a range of measures to tackle the financial crisis. Among those measures was a commitment to better regulate the activities of hedge funds. At EU-level, the European Commission's proposal for a Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (the AIFMD) has recently been agreed by the European Parliament and the Council. This Directive sets down rules with which the managers of hedge funds, as well as private equity and other alternative funds, must comply.As well as increasing the level of transparency of fund managers towards investors, the AIFMD will also require greater transparency with supervisors. This will ensure that supervisors will be in a much better position to monitor and respond to any possible financial stability risks which might be generated by hedge funds.  Similar steps have been taken in the United States where the Dodd-Frank Act imposed substantive regulatory and reporting requirements on hedge fund managers.  The AIFMD will also provide greater safeguards for employees of firms which are acquired by private equity funds. The timely disclosure of, for instance, the financing of the acquisition as well as strategic plans for the acquired firm, will be required. Specific rules to limit the effects of "asset stripping" will also apply.Another significant proposal which is also being considered at EU level is in relation to restrictions on "short selling". On 15 September last, the European Commission adopted a formal proposal for a Regulation on short selling and certain aspects of Credit Default Swaps. This proposal is currently being discussed by the relevant working parties in the Council and the European Parliament.Many Member States had already introduced measures aimed at banning or restricting short-selling. The Commission have identified that a much more consistent approach is required to minimise divergences between Member States in their treatment of this issue. The Commission's draft Regulation is their response to address this issue. In Ireland, the Central Bank maintains a ban on the short-selling of shares in financial institutions.While national competent authorities will have powers to implement bans or restrictions in emergency situations, the proposal envisages a strong role for the soon-to-be-established European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in co-ordinating situations where bans are being contemplated. Full details of the comprehensive EU programme of financial sector reforms are set out in the European Commission's Communication on Financial Services 2010-11 which is available at http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/finances/index_en.htm
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	544	Consideration of how to ensure that the financial sector contributes to the cost of dealing with crises is under way in various fora internationally, including the EU and the UN.  The European Council in June agreed that EU Member States should introduce systems of levies and taxes on financial institutions to ensure fair burden-sharing and to set incentives to contain systemic risk.  The Council called for careful assessment of the main features and issues of level playing field and cumulative impacts and invited the Council and the Commission to take this work forward and report back in October.The IMF report to the G20 in June analysed various options including a financial transaction tax and proposed two possible contributions from the financial sector: a Bank Levy, or "Financial Stability Contribution" levy (FSC), to pay for the fiscal cost of government support of the sector; and a tax on financial transactions which involved two options, a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT), charged on financial transactions undertaken by financial institutions covering dealings by those institutions in stock, bonds and derivative transactions in exchanges as well as instruments traded "over the counter" rather than in a recognised exchange, but not transactions undertaken by individuals and businesses, or a Financial Activities Tax (FAT), a broader tax levied on the profits and remuneration of financial institutions, which is sometimes described as a form of VAT on financial institutions by targeting the ‘added value' of the services they provide (there is no VAT on financial services in the EU).In a May 2010 Communication, the European Commission supported the establishment of ex ante   resolution funds, funded by a levy on the banks to facilitate the managed failure of ailing banks in an orderly manner and suggests that a resolution fund should form part of the toolbox of measures available to Member States in an EU crisis management framework.  An objective of the Commission’s proposal, in conjunction with its wider proposals on a crisis management system, is to mitigate the burden on the taxpayer arising from financial crises.   In its Conclusions of 14 June 2010, the European Union Foreign Affairs Council decided that the EU should “seriously consider proposals for innovative financing mechanisms with significant revenue generation potential, with a view to ensuring predictable financing for sustainable development, especially towards the poorest and most vulnerable countries”. To that end, a Taskforce on Innovative Financing for Development has been established at the EU level, with Ireland’s participation. The Taskforce is playing a role in assessing innovative financing mechanisms, contributing with concrete and feasible proposals, and co-ordinating the work on innovative financing within the EU.This is a complex area and careful consideration is being given at EU and UN level to the issues involved. Ireland is of course participating in those deliberations.  At UN level, much of the international discussion on innovative financing is being conducted through the Leading Group on Innovative Financing for Development, a group of interested countries and international organisations and NGOs.  The next meeting of the Leading Group is to be hosted by Japan, the current Chair, in December.  Ireland is not a member of the group, but will attend as an observer.  The Leading Group held a session on the sidelines of UN High Level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in September this year. This highlighted possible new instruments under study for innovative development financing. One of these is the possible introduction of a tax on currency transactions.The Final Declaration adopted by the UN High Level Plenary Meeting refers to the role of innovative financing to achieve the MDGs, and noted that voluntary mechanisms should be effective and should aim to mobilise resources that are stable and predictable, supplementing and not substituting for traditional sources of finance for development.  Following negotiations in the Second Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, it is likely that the General Assembly will adopt a Resolution on the issue of innovative financing in the coming weeks. The Resolution is expected to request that the Secretary General of the UN prepare a report to examine the contribution and potential of innovative mechanisms of financing for development to achieving international development goals.

The total amount of funding paid to charities under the Scheme was €7.618m in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, €7.730m in 2005 and €8.618m in the years 2005 to 2009 inclusive.Details of the amounts paid to each of the charities under this Scheme in each of the years 2002 to 2008 appears under the Appropriation Account for Vote 6 (Office of the Minister for Finance), in the Comptroller and Auditor General's website, for each of those years.  Similar information in relation to payments under the Scheme for 2009 can be found on my Department's website.Under the terms of the Scheme, applicants for funding are required to provide an auditor's letter confirming that any funding received under the Scheme in the preceding year has been spent on the charitable activities of the organisation. Monies received under the Scheme must be shown separately in the audited accounts of the charity.

In my role as Minister for Finance I have no function or influence in this matter.   In this regard, it should also be noted that there can be different levels of risk within the same area depending on where a house is located and this may be a factor in deciding whether a policy is renewed or not. Other factors which may influence such a decision include the design of the house and the number and nature of claims previously made.The persons in question have the option of referring this matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman at www.financialombudsman.ie for investigation and adjudication.

These are under active consideration in my Department in the context of the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the new measure and have not yet been decided by Government.  While I am not in a position to give the detailed figures requested by the Deputy, I can confirm that the new scheme will reduce the gross pension cost as a percentage of pensionable remuneration. In this connection I would direct the Deputy to the Comptroller & Auditor General's recent Special Report on Public Service Pensions (published October 2009), as updated by the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Accounts of the Public Services 2009 (published September 2010).  These Reports contain indicative cost figures based on certain assumptions. I would add that the cost benefits to be delivered by the new scheme will vary depending on levels of future recruitment to the public service, service periods, pay and other factors over the next half century.

Schedule 26A, Part 1, of the TCA, sets out the approved bodies for which donations relief is available. The majority of educational establishments in the State are eligible. The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on such donations varies, depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a person who is subject to self-assessment or a company.   Section 1003 of the TCA already provides tax relief in respect of the donation of important national heritage items to the Irish national collections. The relief consists of a tax credit equal to 80% of the value of the heritage item(s) donated, which can be credited against particular tax liabilities incurred by the donor.All tax reliefs and incentives are reviewed regularly as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.

The Fourth Schedule listed a number of services that were to be taxed in the Member State where they were received.  The Fourth Schedule was discontinued from 1 January 2010 as part of the introduction of the EU wide changes to the Place of Supply rules for intra-community services, which provided that the majority of services, and not just those listed in the Fourth Schedule, are taxable where received.   In general the supply of goods and services by a VAT-registered trader in one EU Member State to a VAT-registered trader in another EU Member State qualifies as an intra-Community supply. In the case of goods, a VAT-registered trader in another EU Member State may zero-rate the supply to a customer in the State if the customer is registered for VAT in the State.  In the case of services, the place of taxation is the place where the recipient is established (generally registered for VAT) in the case of business-to-business supplies.  In both cases, the customer registered for VAT in the State accounts for VAT on the acquired goods and received services at the appropriate Irish VAT rate.  Where the VAT registered customer uses the goods and services for the purposes of his taxable supplies a simultaneous input credit may be taken thus cancelling the VAT liability.With regard to the intra-Community supply of services to persons not registered for VAT the place of taxation is the State where the supplier is established.  I would point out that the Place of Supply rules provide for some changes in the coming years but these are not relevant to the Deputy's question.With regard to the revenue generated by altering the VAT rates applied to received services from suppliers established in other EU Member States, it should be noted that the majority of these services are already charged to VAT at the standard rate and as such it would negatively affect Exchequer yield were a reduced rate to be applied to them.  In any case, where the received services are used by a VAT-registered person for business purposes the VAT is reclaimed and as such any VAT rate changes would have no Exchequer impact.I would point out that the Place of Supply rules have EU-wide application and as a consequence it is not open to Ireland to unilaterally amend the rules.

The EU Commission undertook a study of the possibility of using reduced VAT rates as a tool to support the climate change agenda. While Ireland expressed support for such a study, the EU Council of Finance Ministers decided in 2009 not to allow reduced VAT rates as a tool for achieving environmental policy objectives. In general it was considered that if assistance was required, providing it through direct expenditure measures was the better approach to adopt.  In this context, the VAT reduction proposed by the Deputy would have to apply to repairs, maintenance and improvements in all situations and not just those related to energy efficiency.   Reducing the VAT rate on the repair, maintenance and improvement of private housing in general to 5% would alone cost some €270m in a full year.  This would have significant implications for Exchequer revenues which are difficult to justify in the current economic climate.Furthermore, introducing a VAT rate of 5% on energy upgrading would entail the introduction of a second reduced rate of VAT.  This would render a VAT system that is complex, even more so, increasing the number of VAT rates in Ireland to five.  Were a new reduced rate of 5% to be introduced, there would be calls for all goods and services that currently apply at the 13.5% rate to be charged at the new lower rate.  For example if only half the goods and services currently subject to the reduced rate of 13.5% were to be moved to a 5% rate the cost to the Exchequer would be around €1.1bn in a full year.

The ‘end of year' for financial accounts purposes varies from moneylender to moneylender.  I should point out that there is a requirement on the Central Bank to publish a register of licensed moneylenders.

This is because the number of new licensees is generally offset by the number who cease operating as moneylenders.

The vehicle was also used for delivering post and other materials between Dublin and Trim, and for conveying staff from one location to the other for the purpose of business meetings. Now that a public transport service is in place for the times required for normal attendance hours, since 12 November 2010, the OPW vehicle is no longer used for this purpose.A single vehicle was used with a maximum capacity of 16 persons. While it was in operation, the average usage was 12 to 14 persons per trip. The additional marginal total cost, over and above drivers salary, which is a cost that would have been incurred in any event, for the relevant period of April 2010 to November 2010, amounted to €13,000 approximately. This amount covers fuel costs and supplemental drivers time but not insurance as the State carries its own insurance in such circumstances.

Work on other recommendations is in hand. The new measures referred to by the Deputy in her question are summarised below under the headings ‘Interim Report Main Recommendations' and ‘Final Report Main Recommendations' for completeness. A complete list of all the recommendations is included in Chapter 2 of the Final Report available at (www.finance.gov.ie  ).Interim Report Main RecommendationsAll lenders will be required to put in place a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process. This will ensure consistent treatment of borrowers in difficultyThere will be much greater emphasis on communication with borrowers at all stagesThere will be standardised documentation and a consistent approach to borrowers in difficultyThere will continue to be a strong emphasis on forbearance to give borrowers the opportunity and time to resolve their difficultiesThe Department of Social Protection should introduce an alternative and more equitable approach to achieving the MIS objectives an maintaining its sustainability in light of changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market.Final Report Main RecommendationsA Deferred Interest Scheme should be introduced for borrowers who can pay at least 66% of the interest.  This would give borrowers up to 5 years to get back on their feet.Where a mortgage is unsustainable, assessment for social housing should be done before repossession takes place.A mechanism should be put in place to allow repossessed borrowers to remain in their homes for a time, allowing the housing authority time to source appropriate accommodation.New bankruptcy legislation should be introduced.A statutory non-judicial debt settlement system should be establishedThe time limit for discharge of debt should vary in line with the total value of debt.

The current legislation on stamp duty provides no special relief for trade downs.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	561	As highlighted in the Deputy's question, an indemnification scheme is one option that has been suggested for households who are unable to obtain flood cover. A key factor in any decision on this matter will be the impact on future expenditure, particularly in the current economic climate.    As the Deputy will be aware the Government is considering the options open to it in order to try and address the non-availability of flood cover on a cost effective basis for the Exchequer. The costs associated with indemnification are however potentially quite high and are difficult to quantify for any particular year. However, over a period of time it is possible to say that the costs would be significant on the basis that there have been six major floods costing the insurance industry approximately 516m euro in flood claims over the 10 year period 2000-2009.  These costs would be in addition to the normal infrastructure costs which arise from flooding such as repair of roads, bridges etc.Furthermore, there exists a very real possibility that the potential costs of the scheme would increase over time because once indemnification was introduced,   industry would have a strong incentive to discontinue the provision of flood cover in medium and high risk areas.  This would be a serious and retrograde step in seeking to maximise the availability of insurance coverage in the marketplace. Therefore such a proposal has the potential to weaken the existing private insurance regime, thus making it more difficult to withdraw an indemnity, even if introduced on a short-term basis.

A study of the Carnmore area has recently been completed and the flood relief measures proposed in this report will be considered for inclusion in the overall programme of works to be undertaken in Claregalway area. Funding for the detailed design of the scheme and the commencement of construction works is currently included in the OPW's financial programme for 2011.The OPW has also agreed to carry out some interim flood relief measures in advance of the main scheme. These consist of:1. The construction of a flood eye beside Claregalway Bridge.2. The subsequent replacement of Crusheeny Bridge.However a number of archaeological issues have arisen near the Claregalway Bridge site. The Commissioners of Public Works advise that they are hopeful that these issues will be resolved in the near future thereby allowing the interim works to commence shortly thereafter.

The Deputy will be aware that the HSE has reorganised services in the Louth/Meath Hospital Group, and this Hospital continues to play an important and expanding role in the provision of health services in the North East region, with a particular focus on diagnostic and day services.A minor injuries unit and additional ambulance services have been put in place in Dundalk to support this plan. Gynaecology, medical and surgical day services, stroke rehabilitation, radiology and step down services remain in the hospital. In addition, an elderly day assessment service has transferred to Louth County Hospital. Project teams have also been established to progress with development of plans for both the orthopaedic rehabilitation and medical palliative inpatient beds in the hospital.The development of the above services demonstrates the Government's commitment to the future of Louth County Hospital. Patient safety is central to the delivery of health services. People must have confidence in the care they receive and have the best possible outcomes.  All decisions regarding the operation of health services will be taken with patient safety as the priority.

The person's contribution to care is then worked out based on 80% of the person's assessable income, which includes their pension, and 5% of the value of their assets per annum. The person retains the remaining 20% of their assessable income. The first €36,000 of the person's assets, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, is not included at all in the assessment.  It should also be noted that a person will never pay more than the cost of their care.Finally, if 80% of a person's pension per week exceeds the weekly cost of care, they will not qualify for State support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The Government will be considering the 2011 Estimates for the health service over the coming weeks in the context of its strategy for economic recovery and its target to reduce the general government deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014.  Notwithstanding the difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect services, to respond to priority demographic and other needs and to support ongoing reform of the public health services within the resources available for health.  To achieve this, staff at all levels will have to work together to deliver services in a more flexible way.  It is essential that the impact on frontline services of any cuts is minimised while ensuring that the needs of service users remains the highest priority.The HSE is working within limited financial resources.  The appropriate management of the public finances means that the health sector, which represents over 27% of public expenditure, must operate within the approved budget set out at the start of the year.  Under Section 31(1) of the Health Act, 2004, the HSE is required to prepare an annual National Service Plan.  The Plan, which must indicate the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided by the HSE, is submitted to the Minister for Health and Children for approval.  The appropriate management of the health services also means that the mental health services must be funded in an equitable and sustainable manner.The estimated cost of the implementation of ‘A Vision for Change’ is €150m over 7 to 10 years.  Development funding totalling €54 million has been allocated to the HSE since the launch of the Report in 2006.  In addition, almost €1 million was allocated this year under the Dormant Accounts Fund for a programme of suicide prevention measures to help communities to develop integrated local action plans for suicide prevention.  To further the implementation of ‘A Vision for Change’, the 2010 Employment Control Framework for the health service provided an exemption from the moratorium on recruitment and allowed 100 psychiatric posts to be filled by nurses or therapists.There are substantial resources already invested in mental health.  The reconfiguring and remodelling of these resources will be the main focus for the immediate future.  While implementation of ‘A Vision for Change’ has been somewhat slower than originally anticipated it is important to say that in many parts of the country, services are pressing ahead with the implementation of the policy.  Significant progress has been achieved including: shorter episodes of inpatient care, improved child and adolescent mental health services, fewer involuntary admissions and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.  Acute admissions to St Brendan’s Hospital have ceased.  Plans for the transfer of acute inpatient admissions from St Ita’s Hospital to a new purpose built unit on the Beaumont Hospital Campus are proceeding.  New Community Nursing Units in Ballinasloe and Mullingar have been developed.The number of child and adolescent inpatient beds will increase from 30 to 52 before the end of 2010.  This together with the Mental Health Commission code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001 will greatly reduce the need to admit children to adult units.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	582	Under the Health Act 2008, a much simplified system of assessment for eligibility was introduced in respect of persons aged 70 or over, based on the significantly higher gross income thresholds rather than the standard net income limits.  The gross income thresholds are €700 per week for a single person aged over 70 and €1,400 for a couple.Where a person aged 70 or over does not qualify for a medical card by virtue of their gross income being over the specified thresholds, the HSE will assess if the person qualifies for a medical card or GP visit card under the existing net income thresholds.Notwithstanding the above, the HSE may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for himself/herself and any dependants.  To assist the HSE in making such a determination, it is necessary for the applicant to provide information about medical issues and expenses.In January 2009, the Health Service Executive's (HSE) Primary Care Reimbursement Services (PCRS) took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  Under the centralisation plan, the HSE's Local Health Offices continue to have access to the national system and provide the public with assistance and information locally in relation to medical card eligibility and making an application, and the current status of their application or review.To date, the central office at PCRS has processed 232,461 Medical Card applications and reviews.  186,512 Medical Cards were issued, 2,034 applications were unsuccessful, 14,141 applications were incomplete and further information is awaited and 7,534 applications are currently being processed.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	585	The Director of the Office of Quality and Clinical Care in the HSE, met the Irish Consultant Neurologists' Association earlier this year to discuss how best to move neurology services in Ireland forward. Following these discussions it was agreed to set up national programmes on stroke management, epilepsy and access for neurology outpatients.  These programmes were established in the summer and are currently in the planning phase of the process.  The setting up of these programmes shows both the importance that the HSE gives to neurological care, and its commitment to improving access to neurological services.  Specifically, plans for epilepsy and stroke will include developing protocols of care and delivering expert care closer to people's homes as well as in the expert centres and will have a focus on patient advocacy.  Additional revenue funding of almost €8m has been allocated to the HSE between 2006 and 2009 for the overall development of services in the area of neurosciences.

Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

However, as the Deputy is aware, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved. In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy. This position remains unchanged.

The charge applies to everyone with the exception of those who have a letter of referral from a registered medical practitioner and certain other categories of persons, such as persons with full eligibility, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks and children suffering from prescribed long term diseases.My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform has confirmed that in all circumstances where a person requires medical attention, be they a person in custody, an injured party or a member of the public who has become unwell and whom a member of An Garda Síochána encounters in the course of their duty, the primary concern of An Garda Síochána is the well-being of the person concerned having regard to the duty, as provided for in section 7 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, to protect life.  The decision as to whether the circumstances require an ambulance to be summoned is dealt with on a case-by-case basis, in the best interest of the person.  In relation to persons in custody, however, the Garda Síochána have a clearly defined particular legal responsibility.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations 1987 as amended, prescribe the standards for the treatment of persons detained.  In relation to the attendance of a doctor at a Garda Station the regulations provide inter alia that if a person in custody appears to the member in charge to need medical attention, then he or she shall summon a doctor or cause one to be summoned.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 199 together.I met with the Jack and Jill Foundation on Tuesday 12th October last.  The Health Service Executive was also represented at the meeting.  We discussed a range of issues including the funding and provision of services.  I will continue to engage with the Jack and Jill Foundation.Both the Minister and I and the Health Service Executive recognise the valuable contribution that the many agencies and charities make in the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.Reflecting the current economic situation the health sector must manage service levels within available resources. The HSE together with the ‘non-statutory organisations' who provide services on behalf of the HSE, will continue to review how these services are provided in order to protect the delivery of front line services as much as possible. In the current environment, this is a challenge for all, including the HSE and non statutory charity organisations. The HSE will continue to work closely with all agencies and bodies in the sector, including Jack and Jill, to provide whatever assistance it can from within its resources, in the context of the annual Service Level Agreement arrangements.The very difficult financial position facing the country will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure, including the disability sector. Notwithstanding this difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect patient services, to respond to priority demographic and other needs, and to support ongoing reform of the public heath services within the resources available for health.

Statutory Instrument number 87 of 2009, on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, transposes this Directive, alternatively known as the Eurovignette Directive, into national law.  The Eurovignette Directive has already been implemented in Ireland.  There are a number of toll schemes in operation in the State for the purposes of charging for the road infrastructure being used.  The review of the use of the Eurovignette Directive is a matter for the European Commission.

The person referred to by the Deputy was informed of the decision to refuse his application and the basis for this decision by letter dated 1 November, 2010.The person concerned was advised that, if they felt the Deciding Officer had erred in fact and/or law, then they were entitled to request a review of the decision.  The details of how they could seek such a review were set out in the letter.  I should advise that to date my Department has received no such request from the applicant.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

These are matters entirely for the presiding Judge and it would be inappropriate for me to comment or intervene in such matters.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	616	The Fines Act 2010 provides for an innovative, balanced and more humane approach to the determination and collection of fines.The Act will be commenced on a phased basis and the capacity to pay provisions will be among the first features of the legislation to be commenced in January, 2011. Section 14 places an obligation on the court to take account of the defendant's financial circumstances before a fine is imposed.The remaining sections of the Act will be commenced as soon as the necessary arrangements have been put in place by the Courts Service to fully facilitate its operation.The legislation does not make provision for attachment of earnings or social welfare payments. However, section 15 of the Act will allow a person on whom a fine has been imposed to make an application to the court to pay by instalments.  A fine can be paid over a period of 12 months and exceptionally, over a two year period. I would like to see how these arrangements operate in practice before considering the possibility of adding attachment measures to the legislation.The Act also provides for alternatives to imprisonment in the event of default on payment of a fine. In these circumstances, a recovery order — made at the time the court imposed the fine — can be activated and a receiver will be entitled to recover the fine, or to seize and sell property belonging to the person and recover the fine from the proceeds.If the receiver fails to collect the fine or its value in seized goods, section 18 of the Act will make it possible for the court to impose a community service order on the defaulter rather than sending him or her to prison. Imprisonment on default of payment of a fine will be a last resort.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	619	In the absence of details relating to a specific case, the Deputy will appreciate that I am unable to provide a definitive response. However, I can advise of the position generally. At the outset, I should point out that the legislation governing naturalisation does not provide an inherent right to any applicant to a grant of naturalisation on foot of their application. Citizenship in this context is a privilege, not an entitlement.A Certificate of Naturalisation is an exceptional and important document that facilitates a non-national becoming a citizen of Ireland. The making of an application for a certificate of naturalisation is an individual's choice. Applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. The average processing time from application to decision for the generality of valid applications for a certificate of naturalisation is currently 26 months and this has been maintained despite the substantial increases in the volume of applications received in recent years. This has been possible as a result of the allocation of additional resources to the Division and further refinement of procedures. These procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and   continue to be kept under review by my Department to ensure that the integrity of the naturalisation process is maintained.Certificates of naturalisation are issued on payment of the prescribed fee at the time of certification as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. Certification fees for Citizenship were last changed in 2008.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together.As the Deputy is aware, the report concerns a refusal of leave to land case which occurred in January, 2003. Since then there have been a number of developments in relation to the general immigration policy and practice which also have relevance to the findings set out in this report.Moreover, my Department along with other Departments and agencies, co-operated fully with the Irish Human Rights Commission in the conduct of the Enquiry.In particular, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 which sets out a legislative framework for the management of inward migration to Ireland. It sets out in a single code, comprehensive statutory provisions for visas, entry to the State, residence permits and protection as well as streamlined provisions for the removal of foreign nationals unlawfully in the State in place of the current deportation process. The Bill provides for a review mechanism in the case of a decision to refuse to grant a visa and for certain categories of residence permission. I can assure the Deputy that the Human Rights obligations of the State have been fully taken into account in the drafting of the Bill's provisions. The Bill is currently at Dáil Committee Stage. The Bill will be supplemented by detailed guidelines in secondary legislation relating to a range of immigration issues which will provide clear direction for staff and migrants.Furthermore, the visa application and tracking service AVATS which includes an on-line application facility has been rolled out to all visa processing sites in Irish Embassies, Consulates and Visa Offices since July, 2009. The new process provides travellers with a more convenient means of attaining the required documentation for travel to Ireland, whilst at the same time simplifying the process.As regards the Deputy's question in respect of Immigration Officers operating outside this jurisdiction, I would refer him to my reply to Dáil Question No. 952 of 29 September, 2010. In my reply to that question,  I stated that in the event of a member of An Garda Síochána who is an immigration officer travelling outside the State for the purpose of interacting with the law enforcement authorities operating in Northern Ireland or any other jurisdiction, he/she is not in a position to utilise the immigration powers conferred on them by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform as those powers relate only to the control of non-nationals entering, residing in or leaving this State.

The President of the Council was notified accordingly on 21 October 2010.Discussions on the draft Directive are ongoing in the preparatory bodies of the Council. As this is a measure in which the European Parliament is a co-legislator, it would be neither appropriate nor possible for me to say when agreement on the measure will be reached.A decision on how the Directive will be transposed into Irish law can only be made when the final text is available.  However, I can say that preliminary indications are that new primary legislation is unlikely to be required.

This approval was sought on the basis that it is, in my view, important to address this issue, given its trans-border nature, with as coherent and common an approach as possible. A number of the provisions of this proposed Directive are already provided for in Irish law under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008 or are provided for on an administrative basis.  The manner in which outstanding issues will be implemented will be determined in consultation with the Attorney General after the proposed measure is agreed including the timescale for adoption.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 226 together.Citizens over the age of 65 are currently entitled to a passport free of charge.  Introducing an arrangement whereby adults of any age would be eligible to apply for a passport for a period of less than 10 years would increase the total demand for passports and thereby require the recruitment of additional staff, something which cannot be accommodated in the context of the public finances.  In addition, because the logic behind such a suggestion is that such persons would pay a fee lower than that due for a 10 year passport, the significant gap between the fee paid and the cost of producing the passport would have to be met by the taxpayer.  For these reasons, I have no plans to introduce passports of less than 10 years' validity for adult applicants, regardless of age.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	629	As the incident to which the Deputy refers is the subject of legal proceedings in another jurisdiction, I will not comment on any elements which are sub judice, but will limit my reply to the role of my Department in providing consular assistance to the person concerned.   In regard to this case, the relevant Irish Embassy dealt with an Irish citizen who requested consular assistance on behalf of the person mentioned.  As with every Irish citizen who contacts an Irish Embassy, my Department sought to deal with the matter professionally and sympathetically. However, as the person concerned is a citizen of a third country, travelling on a third country passport, our Embassy involved did not have standing to intervene with the local authorities or police on behalf of this person.  The Embassy, nonetheless, endeavoured to provide all appropriate assistance to the Irish citizen acting on this person’s behalf, and contacted the Embassy of the country of the passport which he used to enter the host country to alert them to the situation.The question has since arisen as to whether the person concerned is eligible for Irish citizenship by virtue of naturalisation.  Citizenship legislation and policy is a matter for the Department of Justice and Law Reform in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended. My Department is not aware of the position of the person involved regarding any application he may have made for Irish citizenship.All Irish citizens are entitled to hold an Irish passport, and to seek consular assistance from our Missions abroad by virtue of this.  In general terms, when a person travels outside their country of citizenship, where consular assistance is required, it is provided by their country of citizenship. Where a person holds more than one passport, established international consular practice generally holds that the passport used to enter the host nation will dictate the State through which consular assistance can be sought.Under international law there is no express obligation on countries to legally recognise dual-citizenship and this can have serious implications in the provision of consular assistance. Irish citizens with dual-citizenship travelling on the passport of their other citizenship and requiring consular assistance in the host nation are expected to approach the consular post representing the country of their other citizenship, i.e. the country of the passport used to enter the host country.Although my Department remains ready and willing to assist all Irish citizens, regardless of any other citizenship held, in the host country, the degree to which Irish Missions can intervene in cases of dual citizenship may be limited where the individual has chosen not to travel on their Irish passport.  The authorities in a number of countries will only recognise the citizenship of the passport used on entry.  This is particularly the case when the individual has been arrested or charged with the commission of an offence.I can assure the Deputy that my Department remains at the service of all Irish citizens to provide any consular assistance possible to them in situations of distress overseas.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	630	On 9 November my Department was contacted by a family member of the person referred to by the Deputy, who alleged that the person concerned had been attacked by prison officers in Barlinnie Remand Prison in Glasgow.  On my instruction, our Consulate-General in Edinburgh was in immediate and direct contact with the relevant Scottish authorities at the prison to raise concerns about his treatment and to confirm our interest in his well-being.  They have also contacted the person concerned to offer consular assistance, including, if he wishes, a prison visit.The Consulate-General has today been informed by the prison authorities that the person concerned has ended his hunger strike and is receiving appropriate medical treatment.  Officials of my Department will remain in contact with the prison authorities and will ensure that consular assistance continues to be provided to both the person concerned and his family.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 and 225 together.An annual revenue/cost statement for Passport Service for the period 2006-2009 is set out below.  Figures for 2010 will not be available until the Department's Appropriation Account has been signed after the end of the financial year.The statement shows that whereas the number of passports issued fell by 6.75% over the period, passport fee income has remained relatively stable, reflecting increases in passport charges in 2009.  The average cost of producing a passport varied slightly over the period reflecting the one off costs associated with the introduction of the enhanced security features of the ePassport.I must emphasise that the annualised fee for a standard Irish passport compares favourably with many other jurisdictions.  At €8 per year the Irish passport fee compares with approximately €9 per year for a British passport, €9 per year for a French passport, €8 per year for a Danish passport, €10 per year for a United States passport and €15 per year for an Australian passport.2006200720082009Total Revenue€30,856,000€30,544,000€29,720,000€31,687,000Current Expenditure€34,759,000€42,606,000€37,723,000€36,245,000Capital Expenditure€4,089,000€153,000€435,000€467,000Total Costs*€38,848,000€42,759,000€38,158,000€36,712,000Surplus/Deficit-€7,992,000-€12,215,000-€8,438,000-€5,025,000No. Passports Issued614,215606,937576,617572,783Revenue Per Issue€50.24€50.32€51.54€55.32Cost Per Issue€63.25€70.45€66.18€64.09The cost figures do not include the cost of a range of shared services provided to the Passport Service e.g. financial management and human resource management services provided by the Department, and legal services provided by the Office of the Attorney General.

Within Vote 28 there are two main programmes that provide funding to organisations: the Emigrant Support Programme and Reconciliation and Anti Sectarianism Funds. While some of organisations funded under these programmes have been granted charitable status by the Revenue Commissioners, it is not possible in the time available to identify which organisations hold this status. In addition, in some instances funding is provided to organisations outside of the State where definitions of charitable status may differ.Since 2004, total funding of some €80million has been granted through the Emigrant Support Programme to not-for-profit organisations which provide welfare, information and advisory services to Irish citizens living abroad, particularly those who are most vulnerable and marginalised, including the elderly. Whilst the Emigrant Support Programme does not provide direct support to services for victims of institutional and religious abuse, a number of organisations which receive funding for other elements of their activities through the Programme do provide such services.Since 1999, the Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds have, between them, disbursed over €24 million to over 900 projects to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work and efforts to create better understanding between people on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, and to assist local initiatives aimed at tackling sectarianism. No awards have been made under these funds towards direct support for the victims of institutional and religious abuse.My Department has maintained a significant programme of overseas development aid for many years.  In the current year, the Government has allocated €536 million for this programme from Vote 29. Funding is implemented through Partner Country Governments, Irish and International Non-Governmental and Missionary Organisations, United Nations Agencies and other International Development Organisations. Funding is provided for development programmes in areas of Health, Education, Hunger Eradication and Humanitarian Assistance in some of the world's poorest countries.While upward of 25% of this funding is channelled to, and through, Irish and International Non-Governmental Organisations, Missionary Organisations and other Civil Society organisations in support of their development programmes, no awards have been made towards direct support for the victims of institutional and religious abuse.Details of all expenditure under this programme are available in the Irish Aid Annual Report at  www.irishaid.gov.ie  .

People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.In addition, a person can avail of BTEA to resume studies in a second or subsequent year of a third level course whereas, prior to July, a person could only apply for BTEA if s/he was commencing year one of a course.  This also applies to people who are granted an exemption from a period of their third level course. A person who completed earlier year(s) of his/her third level course on a part-time basis but is now getting a jobseeker's payment, may apply for BTEA to continue the course on a full-time basis.The focus of the back to education allowance is on providing assistance to the highest possible number of those in greatest need in terms of meeting the requirements of the labour market and to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system. It is not considered that existing graduates should have an entitlement to BTEA to pursue a course at a similar qualification level.State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one. There would also be a displacement effect in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level. Furthermore, the scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.However, if a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while still obtaining their jobseekers payment.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and be able to show that the course does not reduce their availability for work.  In the case of jobseekers benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period for which jobseekers benefit is paid.The scheme will continue to be monitored in order to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.

People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.In addition, a person in certain circumstances can avail of BTEA to resume studies in a second or subsequent year of a third level course whereas prior to July, a person could only apply for BTEA if s/he was commencing year one of a course.

A person who completed earlier year(s) of his/her third level course on a part-time basis but is now getting a jobseeker's payment, may apply for BTEA to continue the course on a full-time basis.The back to education scheme covers courses of education from second level to higher diploma level in any discipline [level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)] and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching; level 9 in NFQ) which add significantly to a person's employability.  BTEA will not usually be approved if a person holds a qualification equivalent or higher than the qualification for which the application has been received.  Other postgraduate qualifications (level 9 or level 10) including a Masters qualification are not included.However, a small number of cases have arisen where a college has granted an exemption from the requirement to hold a primary degree and has admitted a person to a Master's course on the basis of relevant life experience. In the context of the ongoing monitoring of the operation of the scheme, it has been decided to extend entitlement to the back to education allowance in these instances on an exceptional basis.The focus of the back to education allowance is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system. People in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a high level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects. Furthermore, the scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.The Government has devoted significant resources to the back to education allowance. This year the budget for the scheme is €169.76m. The number of participants on the back to education scheme in the 2009/2010 academic year was 20,808 which represented a 79% increase on the previous year. As of 12th November 2010, in the region of 24,500 participants were approved for the back to education allowance.

Primary responsibility for this matter rests with the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs and my Department is liaising with them on an ongoing basis.Ireland has been generally supportive of EU initiatives to enhance the minimum level of protection for pregnant workers and is committed to supporting gender equality and ensuring there is a high participation by women in the labour force.  In this context current national provisions extend well beyond the current minimum requirements at EU level of 14 weeks for maternity leave.  Maternity leave of 26 weeks is provided for, during which maternity benefit may be paid at the rate of between €225 and €270 per week.  A further 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave may also be taken.

Officials will meet the organisation to discuss this further at that time.  In this regard the Department will contact the organisation shortly.

The group met on six occasions during 2008 and the expertise of other Departments and Agencies was drawn on as particular issues were being considered.  Discussions were also held with colleagues in Northern Ireland.  A wide ranging consultation process was also undertaken which included a meeting with the social partners; two meetings with carer representative groups; and a public consultation process.  While each of the themes set out in the terms of reference was examined in terms of the current position, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to agree future targets or time limits which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.  This position remains unchanged.

These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation.  This part of the process took on average 35.8 weeks.A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. During 2009, 59% of all appeal cases were dealt with by way of oral hearing but, due to some of the initiatives outlined below, this has been reduced to 31% in 2010 to date.  In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are dealt with in chronological order.Since January 2009, 3 additional Appeals Officers have been assigned to the Office, as well as 4 additional staff to the administration area.  In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired Appeals Officers strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and eight of these officers have been operating on a part-time basis since July.  In addition to the provision of more staff, more emphasis is now being placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity, a project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented and significant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.As a result of all of these initiatives, a total of 22,995 appeals have been finalised until the end of October in comparison to 14,278 in the same period in 2009.  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.

The income and gains of such funds are exempt from tax within the fund. Any amounts withdrawn from an ARF are referred to as a distribution. A distribution is treated as income from an employment. It is subject to income tax and the fund manager must operate the PAYE system on it.Under social welfare legislation any payments received by way of pension are not regarded as reckonable emoluments for the purposes of self-employed Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). However, unlike annuity products, ARFs are not pensions but are treated as assets. As such distributions from ARFs fall within the charge to self-employed PRSI.There has been no recent change in legislation pertaining to this area but my Department did recently clarify to qualifying fund managers that, as the legislation stands, they are required to apply the appropriate PRSI when making distributions. In this regard, it may be noted that only distributions made before pension age will attract the charge to PRSI, as social insurance only applies to individuals between the ages of 16 and 66.My Department, working with the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Pensions Board, is currently engaged in a review of ARFs and the interaction between PRSI and pensions in the context of the National Pensions Framework. This review will have particular regard to the necessity to achieve the correct balance between ensuring that the social insurance fund is supported by contributors and providing incentives for people to save for retirement.

During 2009, 59% of all appeal cases were dealt with by way of oral hearing but, due to some of the initiatives outlined below, this has been reduced to 31% in 2010 to date.  In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are dealt with in chronological order.Since January 2009, 3 additional Appeals Officers have been assigned to the Office, as well as 4 additional staff to the administration area.  In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired Appeals Officers strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and eight of these officers have been operating on a part-time basis since July.In addition to the provision of more staff, more emphasis is now being placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity, a project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented and significant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.  As a result of all of these initiatives, a total of 22,995 appeals have been finalised until the end of October in comparison to 14,278 in the same period in 2009.I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, the appeal from the person concerned has been referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing on 8 December 2010.  The person concerned has been notified of the arrangements.  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.YearReceivedNo. of StaffAverage Time200613,80054.5521 weeks200714,07053.8022 weeks200817,83354.5022 weeks200925,96356.5024 weeks2010 to 31 Oct27,75160.4028 weeks

EU Nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families reside in another EU Member State may have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under EU Regulations.  As a Member State of the European Union, Ireland is bound to apply these Regulations in accordance with the objective of the EC Treaty of the free movement of persons.  Before payment of Child Benefit is made for non-resident children it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will determine entitlement to Irish payments.Control checks are carried out by my Department every three months to ensure that claimants are still resident or are still employed in Ireland.  Applicants for the One-Parent Family Payment are required to make efforts to seek adequate maintenance from their former spouses, or, in the case of unmarried applicants, from the other parent of their child, and must satisfy my Department that they have made reasonable attempts to obtain such maintenance.  Similarly, under the "Liability to Maintain the Family" provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, absent parents have a responsibility to support their children, and this is pursued by my Department in instances where the absent parent is not making sufficient effort to provide adequate support.In every case where a One-Parent Family Payment is awarded, the Maintenance Recovery Unit of my Department seeks to trace the other parent, referred to as the "liable relative", in order to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of the One-Parent Family Payment.  Liable relatives who earn more than €18,000 per annum are assessed with maintenance liability.  Certain categories of liable relatives are not pursued due to personal circumstances or because they have low incomes.All liable relatives assessed with maintenance liability are notified by the Maintenance Recovery Unit and are then issued with a Determination Order that sets out the precise amount of contribution that they must make.  Liable relatives are obliged under law to pay these contributions and could face legal action from my Department if they are found to be reneging on their regular payments.With regard to the statement on unemployment assistance, Jobseeker's Benefit is a short-term insurance-based payment that is designed to provide income support to insured workers during periods of involuntary unemployment.  As such, it is not subject to a means-test and can be paid for a period of up to twelve months.  After a person exhausts their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit, they may qualify for the Jobseeker's Allowance, which is a means-tested payment.

The Government is committed to seeking to maintain the State Pension at 35% of average earnings. The framework includes a number of changes to the State pension in order to make it more transparent, simple and equitable for those who reach pension age.The Deputy will be aware that significant progress has been made in recent years in securing the position of older people in Irish society.  Between 1994 and 2008 social welfare pensions increased by 148% while the consumer price index for this period increased by 51%.  In real terms, increases in the State pension (contributory) have brought the personal rate of pension to a maximum weekly rate up to €230.30 per week with additional benefits provided such as the household benefits and free travel. These pension increases exceeded increases in prices over the period so that significant improvements were made in real terms in pension rates.In Budget 2010, the Government avoided any cuts in the State pension. Weekly rates of payments to pensioners (those 66 and over) were not reduced and neither were other supports such as the household benefits package which includes the free TV licence, electricity/gas allowance and telephone allowance.  The living alone and over 80 allowances were also retained at existing levels. In 2010 more than €4.5 billion has been made available to support over 400,000 pensioners.The Government has already made difficult decisions and the next steps towards recovery will require further such decisions.  Social welfare expenditure for 2011, including expenditure on State pensions, will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget, having regard both to needs and to the resources available to meet those needs.  In an uncertain economic environment, my priority will be to ensure that the Government strategy to stabilise the financial position is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.The issue of medical cards raised by the Deputy is a matter for my colleague, Mary Harney T.D., Minister for Health.

A person who does not satisfy the habitual residence condition is not eligible for specified social welfare payments, regardless of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.The purpose of the habitual residence condition is to safeguard the social welfare system from abuse by restricting access for people who are not economically active and who have little or no established connection with Ireland.I am not aware of any country that makes its assistance schemes freely available to all persons without some condition as to nationality or residence.  Determination of a person's habitual residence is made in accordance with Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended.  The factors set out in this legislation have been derived from European Court of Justice case law which examined the concept of habitual residence in the context of social welfare benefits.  That case law also confirms that including a habitual residence condition for social assistance payments where persons have had little or no link to the employment market is not in conflict with the freedom of movement rights within the EU.The habitual residence condition does not apply to exceptional needs or urgent needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  These payments may therefore be used to meet the immediate needs of any person who is in need.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	657	In considering any changes to social welfare schemes, full consideration is given to the impact of any proposals on the recipients involved.Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  In the case of persons being cared for at home, the care they receive is usually a balance of support from family and professional help.  The Department of Social Protection provides income supports for family carers while the Department of Health and Children provides professional support.The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.Following this year's Budget, the carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at €239.  The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.  Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.These levels surpass the ‘Towards 2016' commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.The professional support provided for people at home is delivered through a range of community services such as home-help, home care packages, meals-on-wheels, and day/respite care.  Such supports have the added objectives of reducing inappropriate admissions by older people to acute hospital or long-term residential care.The importance attached to these services is highlighted by the fact that over €200m additional funding has been provided in recent years for these services.  The HSE has responsibility for the delivery of home care services, in line with its National Service Plan 2010.  This commits the Executive to provide 12 million home-help hours nationally this year to over 54,000 people. The target for 2010 for home-help hours is unchanged over the 2009 figure. In addition to the mainstream home-help provision, the current plan is designed to deliver home care packages to around 9,600 people at any one time, or to some 13,000 clients over the course of the year, and to cater for the provision of around 21,300 day/respite care places.In the period 2006 to 2008, over €425m was provided to the HSE under the National Disability Strategy Multi-Annual Investment Programme for the provision of additional specialist health and personal social services for people with a disability. In 2009, the HSE provided 3.2 million hours of personal assistant/home care services to people with a disability.In Budget 2010 additional funding of €19.5m was provided to the Executive to respond to demographic growth in demand for emergency residential placements, additional day places, and personal assistant/home support hours. The current HSE Service Plan commits the Executive to providing the same level of service as in 2009, in other words, 3.2 million hours, and an additional 140,000 hours of personal assistant/home care services for people with a disability.The Government will continue to support carers and the people they care for within the resources available.

It is not possible to give the monetary value involved in these cases.There has been a significant increase in the numbers of appeals being made to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Currently it is anticipated that some 33,000 appeals will be received for 2010, which is compared to roughly 15,000 a year in the years up to and including 2007.  The scale of the increase has resulted in significant delays in the processing of appeals.Overall, the average time taken to process a summary decision is 28 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing is 44.5 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.

Since May 2008, some 450 additional posts have been assigned to the Department to deal with the significant increase in claims for the schemes operated by the Department.  In addition, a significant number of staff within the Department have been redeployed to critical front-line positions.It is also recognised that the provision of additional staff in itself is not the only appropriate way to deal with the rising claim load.  Since early 2008 all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims has been examined and streamlined wherever possible without, of course, compromising our scheme controls.  In this context, the Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives regarding claims for Jobseeker's Allowance and Jobseeker's Benefit.  One of the most significant initiatives, aimed at reducing queuing times and waiting times, involves the customer attending the office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.In addition, a range of other process improvements have been introduced which include:A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseeker's   allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires;A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years;Application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department's website.  This means that anyone who wants to make a claim  can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps reduce queuing times;More straightforward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced;The Department has also simplified processing methods for some customers who work casually, part-time or on systematic short-time work.

Most of the agreements came into effect between 1989 and 1999.  The Agreement with the Republic of Korea came into effect on 1 January 2009.  Ireland also has a bilateral understanding with Quebec since 1 October 1994. In the cases of Austria and Switzerland the agreements have limited application, as the EU Regulations now apply to these countries.  An agreement with Japan was signed on 29 October 2009 and will come into effect from 1 December 2010.The agreements with UK and Australia are the only agreements which have been revised.  The current agreement with the UK, which came into effect on 1 October 2007, provided for the repeal of previous agreements which had been superseded by EU Regulations.  Provision was made to extend social security protection for migrant workers moving between Ireland and the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands which are outside the EU.  The agreement with Australia was revised mainly to accommodate changes in Australian legislation.  The process also facilitated technical updates on the Irish side (changes of scheme names etc.), but no substantive change was required.Revisions to the agreement with New Zealand are currently being negotiated. The New Zealand authorities are examining the impact on Bilateral agreements of changes to their national legislation.  The changes being considered on the Irish side are similar to the technical updating made in the revision of the agreement with Australia.These agreements are working well and meeting their intended purposes.  Revision of the substantive provisions on the Irish side are not considered necessary at present.

In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department.Planning authorities and the board are required to give the reasons for their decisions on planning applications and, in the case of board decisions, the reasons for the decision will be given in the board order, the direction and the inspector's report.  The board's order is given to the planning applicant in every case and is placed on the board's website, with the direction and inspector's report, within three working days of the decision.  In the case of a refusal of permission, the applicant can consider whether, in the light of the reasons for the decision, it would be possible to make a revised planning application which addresses the concerns of the board to the original proposal.  It is open to the applicant, under section 247 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to seek a pre–application consultation with the planning authority in relation to a further planning application.Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.

This initiative was discontinued in 2009 in light of developments in the economy at large, and in the housing market in particular.  While all existing scheme approvals under the initiative, for which contracts had not been signed or letters of intent had not issued, were withdrawn, authorities were given the opportunity to make a case for the continuation of a scheme where it was necessary for the proper development of an area.As a result of submissions made in this regard by Cork County Council, Crookstown Sewerage Scheme is included in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 as two contracts to start with a combined estimated cost of €2.4 million, with €1 million in respect of the network and €1.4 million for a waste water treatment plant upgrade.  A copy of the programme is available in the Oireachtas library.  Further progression of this scheme is a matter for Cork County Council.The Council has indicated to my Department that an upgrade of the Crookstown water supply scheme is not required. In this regard, Crookstown currently provides water for Cloughduv, and the Cloughduv water supply scheme, which is included in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, is scheduled to come on stream in March 2011. This will result in the supply in Crookstown being sufficient to serve the town of Crookstown and its environs.

The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  There is a single liability date in each calendar year and the Act provides, at section 3(2), that this is 31 March in 2010 and subsequent years.The Act places the onus on the owner to assess his or her liability in the first instance and there is no obligation on local authorities to issue invoices or demands.  Any such obligation would increase the administrative and resource requirements of implementing the charge and would make its collection less cost-effective.  As the charge is set at an essentially modest rate of €200 per annum, it is essential that administrative costs be kept to a minimum.However, I understand that anybody who paid the charge in 2009 and provided an e-mail address has been sent an e-mail reminder in respect of possible liability in 2010.  In addition, a number of local authorities have separately sent reminders to property owners registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  As the Act places collection of the charge under the care and management of the relevant local authority, any contact made by a local authority with those who may be potentially liable for the charge is a matter for that individual local authority.

Borrowings drawn down are at prevailing interest rates.  It is important to note that any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property.  In other words, if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing interest due on the local authority's share, the purchaser stands to gain because the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.  In addition further support is available through rent subsidy.  This is available to households purchasing under the Shared Ownership Scheme who have a gross household income of up to €28,000 per annum in the preceding tax year.

Offence and penalty provisions are also set out in the Act and associated Regulations made under section 12(2) prescribe where maps and lists of monuments are to be exhibited and the arrangements for providing information to the public in that respect.Any issues in relation to the constitutionality of these provisions would be a matter for determination by the Courts.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	672	I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 to 277, inclusive, and 280 together.The UNESCO World Heritage Convention requires that all properties inscribed on the World Heritage List are safeguarded through regulatory measures at national and local levels that assure their survival and protect them against development and change that might negatively impact on their outstanding universal value, or their integrity and/or authenticity. Ireland's two World Heritage properties, Brú na Bóinne and Skellig Michael, are national monuments as defined in the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended, and benefit from the protection regime provided by that code.The Brú na Bóinne World Heritage Site Management Plan published in 2002 and the Skellig Michael World Heritage Site Management Plan 2008–18 were produced by my Department in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, following an extensive consultation process. The aim of these plans is to assist in the protection and conservation of the World Heritage Sites. My Department has commenced preliminary work on a new management plan for Brú na Bóinne. Also in co-operation with the Office of Public Works, my Department manages and funds a substantial targeted programme of conservation and maintenance of other monuments in state ownership or guardiandship.  All related works are undertaken in accordance with international best practice.More generally, the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004 provide the overall statutory framework for the protection of all archaeological elements of the built heritage, including national monuments. Section 26 of the 1930 Act is a key element of that regime and provides the legal framework relating to the control of excavation for archaeological purposes. The provisions of section 26 accord with article 3 of the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage, also known as the Valetta Convention, which Ireland ratified in 1997.In addition to the statutory provisions governing regulation and oversight of this area, a range of guidance documentation relating to archaeological excavation has been published by my Department, including Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage  which sets out overall policy on the protection of the archaeological heritage and Policy and Guidelines on Archaeological Excavation which deals specifically with excavation, including licensing issues, excavation strategies, the conduct of excavations and reporting. A detailed guidance document on report writing is also available.While I have no general oversight role in relation to the award of contracts to archaeological consultants, I am responsible for excavation licensing under the 1930 Act. Such licences are issued subject to a standard set of conditions relating to the proper conduct of the excavation, including a requirement for the excavator to furnish reports on the results of the excavation.  My Department's policy and practice is to seek to ensure that licence conditions are complied with, including conditions relating to the submission and publication of such reports. I am aware that, although there have been delays in the production of some reports, there has been a substantial improvement in the extent of arrears in recent years.  My Department will continue to liaise with licence holders to ensure that outstanding reports are submitted as quickly as possible.Although the existing provisions for regulation of archaeological activity have generally been effective, the Government has approved the General Scheme of a Monuments Bill following a major review of archaeological policy and practice overseen by an Expert Advisory Committee. The Bill will provide for a new and comprehensive licensing system which will provide the Minister with the power to require a joint application where it is clear that the applicant is acting on behalf of another person: this should help to improve levels of compliance with licence conditions.Moreover, applications will be considered taking account of a range of statutory factors, including the previous record of the applicant in complying with the conditions of any earlier licences. A statutory basis will also be established for the assessment of the competence of a licence applicant, together with a formal appeals mechanism where applications are refused. Finally, it is intended that comprehensive provisions will be set out in the Bill in relation to the conditions that may be attached to the grant of a licence, including detailed requirements relating to reports, and offence provisions in cases of non-compliance.

For example, section 5 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987 requires individual notification of landowners in respect of any entries in the Register of Historic Monuments (RHM) on their lands.  In addition, regulations made under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994 prescribe where maps and lists of monuments compiled under the Record of Monuments and Places (RMP) are to be exhibited and the arrangements for providing information to the public in that respect.  The standard application form to seek planning permission requires applicants to state whether the application relates to development which affects or is close to a monument or place recorded under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994   and advises applicants as to the availability of the Record of Monuments and Places.

It is a matter solely for the housing authority concerned to determine whether an applicant for social housing support is eligible for and in need of that support in accordance with the provisions of section 9 of the Housing Act 1988 and having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.Current regulations governing rent supplement provide that, with the exception of certain categories of household, an assessment of housing need is required as part of the process of determining eligibility for rent supplement.  Details on the carrying out of assessments of housing need for rent supplement purposes are set out in Circular N09/09 issued by my Department in July 2009.  A copy of the circular has been sent to the Deputy for information.

Approvals were largely based on the prioritisation afforded to individual proposals by local authorities. The project in question was placed eighth on the list of proposals submitted by Cork County Council.  It is intended to issue a call for proposals in the course of 2011 for new projects to be included in the ongoing CAS work programme. It will be a matter for Cork County Council to submit a prioritised list of projects for inclusion in the programme having regard to the merit of the proposals received and the extent to which proposals will meet local housing needs.

The amended section 42 provides that planning permission may be extended where substantial works have not been undertaken, or where the development has not commenced, in cases where a planning authority is satisfied that there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission. This latter provision is subject to the following qualifications—that the planning authority is satisfied that there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the regional planning guidelines for the area of the planning authority since the date of the permission such that the development would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area,that the planning authority is satisfied that the development would not be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area having regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28 of the Act, notwithstanding that they were so issued after the date of the grant of permission in relation to which an application is made under this section, andthat the planning authority is satisfied where the development has not commenced, that an environmental impact assessment, or an appropriate assessment, or both of those assessments, if required, was or were carried out before the permission was granted.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	680	The Water Framework Directive establishes a legal framework for water management, for protection and restoration of waters, and for ensuring the long-term sustainable use of water. The Directive's river basin planning process involves an integrated planning approach with regard to land, water and ecosystem management, involving economic considerations and requiring a high level of public participation. The first River Basin Management Plans were finalised for each of our seven river basin districts in July 2010.My Department is finalising proposals to give effect to the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government  to introduce charges for water services in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied. The installation of water meters in households connected to public supplies will encourage householders to conserve water and will complement the investment on water conservation measures in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012  which I announced earlier this year. The new investment programme includes an increased focus on water conservation. Levels of unaccounted for water need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The full integration of water conservation measures into the investment programme will ensure that network rehabilitation and conservation measures are addressed in the planning of water supply schemes.Some €1 billion or 27% of total Exchequer spending on major public water and waste water schemes over the period 2000 to 2009 has been related to water infrastructure. As a result, there has been an increase in water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of over 1 million and an increase in water supply storage capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of over 1.6 million in the period 2000-2009. A further €900 million in Exchequer resources has been spent under the Rural Water Programme, the majority of which has funded improvements in water infrastructure in the group water sector.

The Authority is a content regulator for commercial, community and public service broadcasters.Section 124 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 allows for the Authority to recommend in a report to the Minister an annual licence fee modification.  This recommendation is to be based on a review on the extent to which RTÉ has fulfilled its commitments in respect of its public service objects stated in its annual statement of performance commitments for that financial year and the adequacy or otherwise of public funding to enable the corporation to meet its public service objects.A review of RTÉ's 2009 public service commitments has been carried out by the BAI, the findings of which will be discussed at the next meeting of the Authority's Board on 13 December. It is expected that the Authority will be forwarding a report on this matter to my Department following this meeting.In relation to easy-pay methods, An Post's ‘Easypay Direct Debit Plan' allows people to spread their payments for their TV licence over the year — with options for biannual, quarterly or monthly payments.  The monthly option which costs €13.33 per month has grown with over 2,000 new people signing up for this option last month. To avail of the Direct Debit Scheme a person must complete a mandate form which they can request from their local TV Licence records office or can download from www.tvlicence.ie.  A bank account is required for this option.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	686	The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  ComReg's website www.callcosts.ie   provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis, including County Donegal.While my Department does not hold information on broadband penetration and speeds by region, ComReg publishes quarterly statistical reports on national developments in the fixed-line, mobile and broadband communications markets.These reports demonstrate the significant progress in broadband roll-out over recent years.  At the end of June 2010 Ireland had in the region of 1.48 million broadband subscriptions and narrowband connections had reduced to less than 5% of all Internet connections. 85.8% of SMEs are now using broadband speeds between 2mbps and 10mbp and of the homes with broadband access, 77.8% of them are also using broadband speeds between 2mbps and 10mbps.  The year-on-year growth in subscriptions over the preceding 12-month period from June 2009 was over 16.5%.A list of the 52 Electoral Divisions (EDs) covered by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in County Donegal is provided below.  The provision of broadband services under the NBS advanced incrementally over a 22 month period and services are now available throughout the entire NBS area.  My Department and its external consultants actively monitor coverage within the NBS areas.  In summary, broadband services in the NBS EDs in County Donegal are available to 98.55% of premises by means of mobile wireless broadband coverage, with coverage to the balance of 1.45% of premises being provided by way of satellite.It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally launch a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of this year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.  While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS.  This process will be technology neutral — it will be a matter for the bidders to decide which technical approach they propose in their bids.Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.Electoral Divisions (ED) Covered by the NBS in County DonegalED NameED Reference No.ALTNAPASTE ED57001ARAN ED57003ARDMALIN ED57005ARDS ED57006BALLINTRA ED57007BALLINTRA ED57008BALLYSHANNON URBAN ED57012BINBANE ED57014CARROWKEEL ED57025CARTHAGE ED57026CAVANGARDEN ED57031CHURCH-HILL ED57032CLIFF ED57033CLOGHAN ED57034CLOGHER ED57036CREENASMEAR ED57043CREESLOUGH ED57044CROVEHY ED57046DOE CASTLE ED57052DUNAFF ED57056DUNLEWY57060EANYMORE ED57061FANAD NORTH ED57064FANAD WEST ED57065FEDDYGLASS ED57066FINTOWN ED57068GARTAN ED57069GLEN ED57070GLENALLA ED57071GLENLEHEEN ED57076GORTAHORK ED57081GRAFFY ED57083GROUSEHALL ED57086INISHKEEL ED57090KILGOLY ED57094KILLYMASNY ED57099LAGHY ED57104LETTERMACAWARD ED57108LOUGH EASK ED57110MAAS ED57112MALIN ED57116MALINBEG ED57117MEENACLADY ED57119MEENCARGAGH ED57120PETTIGOE ED57126SEACOR ED57134ST JOHNSTOWN ED57135TAWNAWULLY ED57139TEMPLECARN ED57140TEMPLEDOUGLAS ED57141TERMON ED57142TULLYNAUGHT ED57146

The inspection process is complete and the results are now being processed.Under EU regulations governing the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payments Scheme all Ground Eligibility Inspections must be completed before any payment can issue to any applicant under either scheme, including those not selected for a Ground Eligibility Inspection.In the vast majority of cases that were inspected amendments have had to be made to the maps in order that the Land Parcel Identification System that is used for making payments to farmers is kept up-to-date. Processing of these changes is continuing with priority being given to applications that were the subject of a Ground Eligibility Inspection.Applications were also received requesting the transfer of 55.82 Single Payment entitlements and 90.69 Single Payment entitlements from the sole names of the persons named into the joint names of the persons named by way of Milk Production Partnership.

Under the Terms and Conditions of the Welfare Scheme, it is necessary in the case of herds with more than 10 animals that calves be weaned in at least two separate groups with each group being removed at a minimum interval of 5 days.As the person named submitted a weaning date of 8 October 2009 for all the animals, the correct procedures as outlined have not been followed. To this end, a letter issued to the person named advising him of the non-payment of his animals.  An appeal was received in June 2010 but offered no new information to warrant a reversal of the original decision. A letter has now issued to the applicant advising him of the review decision and informing him of his right to appeal this decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office.

This application was not accepted for processing as it was received after the date the scheme was suspended for new applications, i.e. 14 October 2008. My Department's decision to reject this application was upheld by the Agriculture Appeals Office.The scheme was reopened for applications for the period from 23 September to 30 October 2009. The person named resubmitted an application on 2 October 2009. This application was accepted and subsequently approved. The first payment issued on 31 January 2010 with arrears backdated from the date of receipt of the valid application.

A number of parcels listed on the application of the person named required re-digitisation; while this process is now complete it was found that the reference areas on a number of parcels had been over-claimed.  These errors were raised with the person named and as a result of the reply received from the applicant the area established for one of the over-claimed parcels is being reviewed. Once this is complete and provided there are no further errors, the application will be further processed with a view to the payments due issuing as soon as possible thereafter.

During the course of the ground inspection carried out on 04/12/2008 and 11/12/2008 discrepancies were found with parcel numbers P12610011 and N10521009 resulting in these parcels being rejected. Parcel P12610011 was not stock proof and was not defined by a permanent boundary on 04/12/2008 and N10521009 was not stock proof on 11/12/2008.  As there is an over declaration of over 20% no payment will be made under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Area Compensatory Allowance Scheme for the year in question.Furthermore evidence was found of intermixing of stock between the herd of the person named and that of his wife. The applicants were informed that their herd numbers must be amalgamated and that they must nominate one herd under which all payments are to be processed.  The person named was informed of these findings on the 6th   January 2009 and of his right to seek a review of this decision within 21 days and of his right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office.At review stage it was decided by the District Inspector to uphold the penalty decision. At present this file is with the Independent Agriculture Appeals Unit.The Independent Agriculture Appeals Office scheduled an oral hearing for the 6th September 2010 but the hearing was cancelled by the person named on the 3rd September as his planner was not available for the hearing date. The Appeals Office has since been in contact with the person named to rearrange a date for this hearing.The 2009 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme application was received on 15th May 2009. A stop has been placed on the 2009 application pending the outcome of the appeal on the 2008 application.The 2010 Single Payment Scheme/ Disadvantaged Areas Scheme application was received on the 11th May 2010 and was selected for a Ground Eligibility and Animal Identification inspection.The inspection process is complete and the results are now being processed.Under EU regulations governing the Disadvantaged Areas and the Single Payment Scheme all Grounds Eligibility Inspection must be completed before any payment can issue to any applicant under either scheme, including those not selected for a Ground Eligibility Inspection.In the vast majority of cases that were inspected amendments have had to be made to the maps in order that the Land Parcel Identification System that is used for making payments to farmers is kept up-to-date. Processing of these changes is continuing with priority being given to applications that were the subject of a Ground Eligibility Inspection.

The inspection process is complete and the results are now being processed. During the course of the ground eligibility inspection the following parcels H12901017, H13602045, H13615065 and H14910089 were found not to be eligible due to inadequate deductions for OPW backdrain, scrub and a derelict outbuilding. The claimed area for Single payment of 75.04ha is reduced to 73.58. As the total area found is sufficient to support the number of entitlements held no penalties will be applied. During the course of the cross-compliance inspection breaches were discovered with regards to Statutory Management Requirement relating to Good Agriculture and Environmental Condition — a designated landscape feature hedge was removed from parcel H1291017. This resulted in a cross compliance penalty of 1% being applied to 2010 Single Payment.A formal decision issued to the person named on 26 October 2010 that advised him of his right to seek a review of the decision within 21 days to the District Inspector and of his right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office.Under EU regulations governing the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payments Scheme all Ground Eligibility Inspections must be completed before any payment can issue to any applicant under either scheme, including those not selected for a Ground Eligibility Inspection.In the vast majority of cases that were inspected amendments have had to be made to the maps in order that the Land Parcel Identification System that is used for making payments to farmers is kept up-to-date.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	706	I understand that the estimated deforested area for the past five years, i.e. from 2005-2009, is 2,063.64 hectares. This estimate is based on felling licences issued and may be subject to amendment once the National Forestry Inventory is completed.In relation to the preservation of our forests in the context of privatisation, I am not aware of any proposals in this regard.  The Deputy will, however, be aware that a review of State Assets and Liabilities is currently being undertaken.Coillte advise that it has sold approximately 15,500 hectares since it was established in 1989, the vast bulk of which was either un-plantable or poor quality, low yield class, forestry.   I am also advised that approximately 3,500 hectares of this was sold to State Bodies.In accordance with Section 39 of the Forestry Act, 1988, under which Coillte was established, the bulk of the State's forestry estate was vested in Coillte upon its establishment.  At this stage, it is difficult to differentiate and collate details of the lands acquired under the Forestry Act, 1956 and track their use and ownership over the intervening 54 years.I wish to advise the Deputy that the Irish Land Commission was dissolved on 31 March 1999 in accordance with the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992, while Coillte was established a number of years earlier, on 1 January 1989.  No land was directly transferred from the Land Commission to Coillte.  I understand that the Land Commission had allotted suitable tracts of land to the Department responsible for forestry with the bulk of such lands subsequently vested in Coillte upon its establishment, in accordance with the Forestry Act 1988 and Section 39 thereof.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I am not aware of any proposals to purchase Coillte.  In relation to the financial state of Coillte, the company recorded a profit of €4.2 million in 2009 despite operating in a difficult trading environment.  The company has recorded retained profits of €256m and eliminated the need for Exchequer funding for operational purposes. It has also funded a major programme of capital investment and increased the value of the forest and land asset through expansion of the estate, improved productivity and output and developing new added value businesses.  The company advises that it is adequately financed and expects to record a profit for 2010.I note that the Irish Forestry Contractors Association met with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 14 April 2010 at which they outlined a number of issues of concern in relation to Coillte following which that Committee then met with Coillte to inquire into those concerns.Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act, 1988 and day-to-day operational matters, such as the use of pesticides, are the responsibility of the company.  The company has advised that it currently has some out of date chemical pesticides in its bundled chemical stores and that it is in the process of having the material disposed of by a licensed waste management firm. Coillte further advise that it only uses pesticides permitted to be used by both FSC and the National Authority, the Pesticide Control Service (of this Department) and that the company has not used lindane for over 10 years.In relation to the ‘nine million euro' to which the Deputy refers, I am taking this to refer to the premium payments previously received by Coillte, of which the EU element amounted to €6.3 million.  Forestry premiums are a means by which landowners are compensated for the loss in income earning potential from the afforestation of their land.  It should be noted that Coillte engaged in a significant land acquisition programme and afforestation in the period in question. The use of the premiums by Coillte, as in the case of other recipients, was a day-to-day operational matter for the company.  As a commercial semi-state company, Coillte must publish an Annual Report and Accounts each year, which includes the Group's audited profit and loss account, the Group and Company Balance Sheet, cash flow statement and other financial data as required under company legislation.While I am aware of the International Forestry Fund, I have no particular views in this regard.

As the total area found is sufficient to support the number of entitlements held, no penalties will be applied. During the course of the cross-compliance inspection breaches were discovered with regards to Identification/Registration of animals under Statutory Management Requirements 7 and 8.  This resulted in a cross compliance penalty of 5% being applied to his 2010 Direct Payments.A formal decision issued to the person named on 27 October 2010 that advised him of his right to seek a review of the decision within 21 days to the District Inspector and of his right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office.

In keeping with standard procedure, all parties concerned were written to; in response, by letter dated 28 September, the person named indicated that he did not have the right to claim the land parcels in question. Following re-calculation of the area in question, the person named was found not eligible for the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, as the over declaration exceeded 20%, as per the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme.As the applicant's determined land after the deduction for the dual-claims is greater than the number of payment entitlements he holds under the Single Payment Scheme, the dual claims deductions will not impact on his payments under that Scheme.

Workers not included within this definition are normally covered by separate schemes of Conciliation and Arbitration.Workers in some parts of the public service, e.g. Local Authorities, Health Service Executive, are already covered by the definition of "worker" and, accordingly, have access to the State's industrial relations machinery.Section 23(1)(e) of the 1990 Act excludes, inter alia, "an officer of a vocational education committee" from this definition of "worker".  Arising from an agreement between management and union sides to abolish the existing Conciliation and Arbitration machinery for vocational educational committee officers and to bring them within the scope of the Industrial Relations Acts, it is now proposed to amend the definition of "worker" to include such officers, with the exception of teachers, within the definition of "worker" in the Act.  An amendment to this effect is included in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil.The question of an amendment to the Industrial Relations Acts to provide for the inclusion of persons employed in the civil service in the definition of "worker" may arise in future in the context of ongoing discussions between civil service management and unions in relation to possible changes in arrangements under the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  These discussions would be a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Finance.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidationI can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim in respect of the individual concerned on 24 May, 2010.  This claim awaits processing.In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements claims dating from April 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff   working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget   towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility  in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  In 2009, my Department processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on the previous year.  Furthermore, the level of new claims processed in the first ten months of 2010 was 63,484 — up over 66% on the corresponding 10-month period in 2009 (38,149) and surpassing the total amount of claims processed for the full year 2009.  The backlog of claims is decreasing — reducing from its highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a current level of 28,300.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Prelude	738	Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme, all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  The entitlement to statutory redundancy is an employment right, and is available to any employee over the age of 16 who is a class A contributor in insurable employment with the employer for a period of two years prior to the date of termination of employment.  Eligible employees are entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a maximum ceiling of €600 on gross weekly pay.A redundancy situation arises in general where an employee's job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.  It is up to the employer concerned in the first instance to determine whether or not in fact a redundancy situation obtains and to submit to my Department an application form (RP50) completed and signed as appropriate by the employer and employee.  This form can be downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ie  Disputes in relation to statutory redundancy entitlement can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.If it is the case that the individual considers that an entitlement to statutory redundancy exists and has sought and been refused statutory redundancy or if the employer refuses or neglects to complete the necessary documentation to allow a claim to be lodged with my Department, the individual concerned may seek a determination on his right and entitlement to redundancy by applying directly to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT).  The Tribunal offices are located at Davitt House, Adelaide Road, Dublin 2.  Please note that an employee must make application for redundancy payment or seek a determination from the EAT within twelve months of ceasing employment, although the EAT has the power to extend the deadline from 52 weeks to 104 weeks.  The 52 week deadline applies both to the making of a claim to the employer and to the making of a claim to the EAT in a situation where the employer disputes payment of redundancy.A claim can be made to the EAT by submitting a form T1-A directly to the Tribunal.  These forms can be obtained from the EAT website http://www.eatribunal.ie.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.It is my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50s) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.Under Redundancy legislation the onus, in the first instance, is on the employer to pay to the employee their redundancy entitlements.  The employer is then entitled, by virtue of pay related social contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, to recover 60% of the amount paid to the employee.In circumstances where the employer is unable to pay the redundancy entitlements, a claim can be lodged with the Department and the documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and the latest set of financial accounts for the company.The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.

The Commission did not propose any change to the payment regime during this proposed period of maternity leave.  The period in question is below the current Irish provision of 26 weeks and, accordingly, the Commission proposal did not impact on the Irish situation.  Discussions have taken place on the Commission proposal at a Council of Ministers technical working group and, while some amendments were made to the original proposal, these still did not impact upon Ireland's position.Commission proposals such as this are subject to the co-decision procedure whereby both the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament must agree the new proposed Directive.  Following its first reading of the Commission proposal, the European Parliament proposed an extension of the period of maternity leave to 20 weeks, which was still below the Irish provision. However, the Parliament has also proposed that this period of leave would be fully paid, which would have a significant cost for most Member States, where the maternity leave regime is shorter and/or not fully remunerated at present.  This latter aspect of the Parliament's proposal would impact on Ireland's Exchequer bill and/or employer costs.Under the rules of procedure agreed between the Parliament and the European Commission, the Commission must now carefully examine the amendments to its legislative proposal adopted by Parliament. The Commission is continuing a consultation process with Member States at official and political levels in relation to the Parliament's proposals in this regard.

Ireland does not tend to become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition,  the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable the State to ratify the Convention.  The Committee has developed a programme on which work is progressing to address the matters that need to be aligned with the UNCRPD.  One of the key requirements in this regard is mental capacity legislation, which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  As indicated in the Government's Legislation Programme, it is intended that the Mental Capacity Bill will be published in the current Dáil session.

The grant paid in quarterly amounts to the Irish Red Cross Society includes the Government's annual contribution (currently €130,000) to the International Committee of the Red Cross.  The balance is used towards the administration and running costs of the Irish office.  The Minister for Defence does not get involved in the day-to-day running of its affairs.  The Geneva Convention places an obligation on Governments to protect the independence of National Red Cross Organisations.
