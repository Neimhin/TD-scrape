#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	Good morning Minister, Minister of State, Deputies and staff of the House. We will take questions to the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Deputy Kyne. I remind Members that they have 30 seconds to introduce their questions. The Minister has two minutes to reply and then Members have an opportunity to ask two supplementary questions. I ask everyone to stick to the time limits laid out.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	Contrary to a sometimes popular perception, the reality is that the most deprived communities in the State are in urban areas. Many of them are in this city, even though we are told it is a very successful one, but they are also in towns around the country. How is the Minister going to ensure that the RAPID programme helps the most disadvantaged communities and does not get spread out into more affluent areas?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	In line with a commitment under the programme for Government, I launched a new RAPID programme in 2017. This was a brand new programme to replace the original RAPID scheme that was funded a number of years ago. Under the new programme, funding is provided for local authority areas instead of for specific RAPID areas as had been the case in the past. Local community development committees, LCDCs, operating under the aegis of the local authorities, allocate the funding to individual projects at a local level. My Department is currently developing proposals for an enhanced programme to support disadvantaged communities and I hope to make an announcement in this regard in the coming weeks. My intention is that the programme will continue to focus on addressing areas of local disadvantage and that LCDCs will continue to administer the programme at local level. By using local structures and local knowledge, we can ensure that funding is given to those areas most in need.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I am concerned by the Minister's answer. By their nature, the LCDCs are going to focus right across the whole local authority area. Taking the Minister's county of Mayo as an example, there is a RAPID area in Ballina but the LCDC represents urban, rural, affluent and not so affluent areas. How is the Minister going to ensure that the focus is on the areas that got the designation? They tended to lose out. What structures are in place to ensure that the housing estates that were the cause of the designation have a big input into where the RAPID funds go?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	In respect of the recent programme, I allocated €6 million in funding, of which €2 million went to the LCDCs. I divided that equally around the country this year. Some €3.5 million will be ring-fenced this year and last year there was €2.5 million ring-fenced for Dublin inner city, in particular. Some €500,000 of that funding was for legacy schemes that had been there in the past. The Deputy is quite correct. That is why I am asking the LCDCs. They are the people who are on the ground, have the local knowledge and should be able to identify where the difficulties are. The Deputy is correct that there is both urban and rural disadvantage. In particular, there are very serious problems in urban areas of disadvantage. That is why we ring-fenced the €3.5 million this year for Dublin inner city. That is why I gave Cherry Orchard €100,000 at the end of last year. It came and made a case to me in respect of difficulties that it had. The Deputy is quite correct. We are looking at the scheme and I intend to have a new scheme up and running by the end of May. I want to identify the areas most in need of funding. I do not want it to be going to areas that do not have the same need. I want them to target the areas that need it most. That is why we are reviewing the scheme at present. The Deputy asked me about the funding and how every county gets the same funding. We need to look at ways and means of identifying the counties and areas most in need of funding.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	The Minister is calling this RAPID, which was the name of a previous programme. Under the previous programme, there were geographically defined areas in which we know scientifically from statistics there is the greatest level of deprivation. Can the Minister tell me if the funding is ring-fenced for the benefit of those areas, or have the LCDCs the power to spend it anywhere they want in the county? Previously, when we had the area implementation teams, AITs, which are now replaced by the LCDCs, there were regular meetings around a table with the Garda Síochána, the HSE, the education and training boards, ETBs, and SOLAS to focus on these areas of concentrated disadvantage. I am concerned that the Minister seems to be diluting the scheme away from those areas. What mechanism has he got in place to focus specifically on the RAPID areas, or has he done away with the concept of a RAPID area as a defined area in which we know statistically that we have massive concentrations of disadvantage?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	In respect of the last programme, there was a value for money audit done in 2011. From that audit, we were told that we were not to continue the practice of the previous scheme. That was in the report. I took over this programme in the middle of last year when I took over the new Department. I was anxious to get the programme out before the end of the year.This is why I made sure that funding was made available to me. The LCDCs and the local authorities gave out to me on the basis that it was too late in the year to get that funding out. The value for money audit programme told me it did not want the structure that was in place. There were 51 areas at the time with co-ordinators so it felt we were not getting best value for money. This is why I must introduce a new scheme, why I am looking at the scheme and why when I announce the scheme at the end of May I intend to address some of the issues mentioned by the Deputy. I gave a commitment to the Deputy in the committee that I would come back to the committee. This is one of the issues we can tease out then.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	We have just finished talking about RAPID. I will tell the Minister one thing. The Leader scheme is far from rapid because there is nothing rapid about the pace at which people around the country are getting the money. It started in 2014. It is now May 2018 and in my county of Leitrim, not one community project and not one person who applied for funding has got a red cent. The statistic showing that only 0.3% of funding has been allocated is a scandal. It is time to recognise that the way in which this has been put in place is not working.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	Leader funding is delivered through local action groups, LAGs, in each of the 28 Leader sub-regional areas around the country. Leader has a budget of €250 million over the period to 2020 and €220 million of this total has been allocated to the LAGs for the delivery of their local development strategies. The amount of funding which is available for projects, as outlined in the strategies developed by the LAGs, is €164.5 million. The remainder of the €220 million covers the administration costs of the LAGs and their engagement with communities to generate projects. An additional €30 million is available for Leader schemes which will be delivered at a national level. These are at an early stage of delivery. As of 31 December 2017, almost 600 projects were approved for funding of over €16.4 million. This accounted for 10% of the funding available for projects - €164.5 million - in the strategies developed by the LAGs. As the Deputy will appreciate, these projects need to be implemented before they can submit payment claims and draw down funding. The pace of project approvals has increased substantially in recent months in line with the historic cycle of Leader delivery. To date, over 900 projects with a total value of almost €27 million have been approved for Leader funding by the LAGs representing over 16% of the project funding outlined in the LAG strategies. A further 320 projects with a value of €17.7 million are within the approvals process. On the basis of the continuing increase in the level of project approvals, together with administrative improvements to Leader which my Department introduced over the last year, I anticipate a significant increase in Leader project expenditure in 2018. 
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	We know that. In fairness, I am not blaming the Minister but he is the person who is now responsible. The truth is that communities the length and breadth of the country are at their wits' end. I come across community projects that tell me that they will never again apply for Leader and go through this process because the way they are being treated is scandalous. I spoke this morning to somebody who works for one of the LAG projects. The person received notification from Pobal saying it had found a typo in a 27-page document and that it needed to be corrected before it could proceed. The person had to search to find a number that was put down backwards. Say the number was 1,710; it had been put down as 1,701 in the document. That number was in the document about ten times but in one spot, Pobal found it was backwards and, therefore, it told the project it had to go through all this again. Who in the name of God is paying this person to sit down and study a thing in that degree of depth that he or she will find a typo and use it as an excuse to hold up funding for a community project? That is what it is doing the length and breadth of the country and it is time to call it out. It is not working and has not worked. It was a disaster from before it started and it is time to say that Leader needs to go back to the way it was in the old programme.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	A Leader forum was hosted by the previous Minister. We made 31 changes to the programme.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	Was it not a bad sign when the Government had to do it?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	Twenty-nine of these were implemented by the LAGs. What I have to do is ensure that this is working. I have met and talked to the national organisation. It now tells me that this programme is working better. I will give some examples. I will give the figures as of 30 April this year. The number of projects approved up to 2017 was 592 with a value of €16.412 million. Up to today, 929 projects to the value of €26.908 million have been approved. In the Deputy's own country where figures have improved since I gave him the figures at a meeting of the committee last week, the number of projects awaiting approval was 14 with a value of €831,000 so someone is drawing it down. A total of 15 schemes have been approved to the value of €224,000. The programme is now ramping up. There is no doubt about it. Let us be honest and fair. When these people make an application, if they are putting up a building or any kind of job they are doing, be it a public or community building, hall or sporting organisation, they must put the building in place. We will not pay them until the building is finished. We will not prepay them so they must wait for the money to be drawn down. The projects are being approved, the scheme is beginning to ramp up and I am confident the Leader programme is now beginning to work with the changes we made as a Government and Department.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I am not denying that and I know that. I know many of these projects that have been approved. Some of them have been approved in Leitrim. However, many of them have not been approved and have been set aside on the flimsiest of criteria. If the smallest mistake is made, out they go. This is the problem. During the last programme, the LDCs worked with people and if there was a bit of a problem, they sorted it out. Now there is no working with anybody. It is my way or the highway and that is the problem these community projects face the length and breadth of the country. I understand that the Minister is doing his best. I am not disputing that but the fact is that when it comes to Leader, the best is not enough. We are not getting the money out to the communities. People are not receiving this money and the people who are receiving it are afraid that when these inspectors come, they will find some problem with it and kick the whole lot out again because the process has been made far too complicated and costly. Too much money is going on red tape and not enough money is going to the people. In fairness, the Minister knows that as well. If he knows it, the time has come to call it out and say that the changes made in 2014 were a mistake and that we need to change it.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	I will take a quick comment from Deputy Breathnach on the same issue.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	I think, particularly with regard to-----
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	The Minister should not tell the Chair what he can or cannot do. I am telling Deputy Breathnach, and I have done so before, that he is entitled to make a very quick comment.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	With regard to community funding, particularly community groups, where bona fide projects are sanctioned, some facility should be available through the banks and credit unions to allow money to be used. It is difficult for small community groups to find upfront money.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	A total of 63% of this funding comes from Europe while 37% of it comes from the Irish Government. There are some rules and regulations with which we must comply with regard to European-----
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	They are over the top.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I simplified this scheme. Deputy Martin Kenny talked about paperwork. We changed the rules and made 31 changes. We got rid of 55% of the paperwork. I cannot do any more. I am happier now than I was last year. I was frustrated last year with some of the companies that did not make any effort to do something to get this funding out. I want this Leader funding spent and used on the ground and I want to see the projects up and running. I want to see jobs created from it and communities benefit from the Leader companies. I am happier than I was a year ago because I now see that the applications are coming in and are being approved and that the work is starting. I can see a problem down the line. At some stage, some Minister will have to find extra funding because in some year, a lot of this funding will have been drawn down from the Department. The Government and the Department know this but at least now, I see a big improvement. Deputy Martin Kenny's own county is not doing too badly but I see counties with five, four, three or two projects. I want to see projects approved and up and running and I want to see the money spent and in place. I have it in place. It creates a problem for me at the end of the year when this funding is not spent.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	It is a tragedy that when the Minister's Department was established, it was given so few functions. Some 99% or 99.5% of the functions and spend in rural Ireland do not come within the Department's remit; therefore, despite the Minister's best efforts, his effect on the well-being of rural Ireland is, by definition, limited. Has he asked for more powers and functions? There are functions in other Departments which should rightly have been transferred to the Minister's Department.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	The Taoiseach’s decision to establish the Department of Rural and Community Development in July 2017 was an important one for communities throughout the country. It underlines the Government’s commitment to ensuring the economic recovery can be felt by every community and that we will build greater resilience for the future. My Department has an important role to play in enabling economic development through the creation of jobs and the infrastructure required to support them and supporting communities to become sustainable and desirable places in which to live, work and raise families. To help bring this about, the Department is working with our colleagues across government to create the conditions to support increased economic opportunities and local employment in all areas of the country; to deliver schemes and programmes that support the revitalisation of towns and villages; to improve access to services and social networks that ensure a high quality of life; to enable communities disadvantaged by location or social issues to reach their full potential now and in the future; and to support all communities to be able to have a voice in shaping their own futures and addressing their common goals. The Department is doing this through the delivery of a variety of programmes, including flagship programmes such as the Leader and the social inclusion and community activation, SICAP, programmes, the revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, RAPID, programme, the town and village renewal scheme, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, the CLÁR programme, the local improvement scheme, LIS, the Dormant Accounts Fund, the seniors alert scheme and the communities facilities scheme. My Department is also playing its part in the roll-out of the national broadband plan, which aims to provide high-speed broadband access to all areas of the country. With regard to the addition of further functions to my Department, it is vital that any Department representing rural Ireland and communities across the country have the mandate to make a difference for these communities. I am satisfied that my Department has a very strong mandate in that regard. To that end, we have seen the transfer of responsibility for the community services programme from the Department for Employment Affairs and Social Protection from the start of 2018. While there are other schemes within the remit of other Departments that could, in time, also be considered for transfer to my Department, my immediate focus is on delivering the significant programme of work ongoing in the Department. In budget 2018 my Department secured in excess of €220 million to fund the schemes I have outlined. The creation of the rural regeneration and development fund and its allocation of €1 billion as part of Project Ireland 2040 presents a huge opportunity for my Department to create further opportunities for growth and development in rural Ireland.  I look forward to working with my Cabinet colleagues and other stakeholders in making a difference to the rural economy and communities throughout the country.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	Sadly, after a very long reply from the Minister, the answer to my simple question appears to be "No". The Minister has not sought further schemes. Previously, when we had a community and rural development policy, it included the rural social scheme, responsibilities for the Gaeltacht and the islands, Waterways Ireland and drugs policy which is tied up with the RAPID programme and social deprivation. Would the Minister like to have these responsibilities back? Would he consider bringing a memorandum to the Government asking that they be transferred to give his Department the clout it needs? He knows in his heart and soul that trying to make representations to other Ministers is not half as effective as having control. Will he consider asking for these functions by bringing a memorandum to the Government stating this is where they rightly should be, given the precedent that this is where they were in the past?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	The Deputy is correct that some of the schemes he mentioned would probably fit in my Department. However, as he knows, we put this new Department together in the last year. I am happy with it and the results of the schemes I have established. I can give the Deputy some figures in that regard. When I am at the Cabinet table I watch the decisions being made and make sure everything is rural proofed. I make sure Ministers are accountable to rural Ireland and I am very pleased with the way my colleagues have responded. At the end of this week we will produce an update on the report on the action plan-----
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	Please do.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	The Deputy should not worry - it is coming up. It is so positive we did not want to bring all of the good news out so fast. Some 93% of the actions have been delivered on. It will be out on Friday. Employment has increased throughout the country. Of the 56,200 jobs created last year, 84% were outside Dublin. Two thirds of the jobs were created with the assistance of IDA Ireland, 50% of which were created outside Dublin. I am delighted with the projects. Some 281 were funded under the town and village renewal scheme; more than 900 Leader projects were funded, while over €20 million has been allocated for 370 projects under the rural regeneration infrastructure scheme. A total of 900 projects have been approved under the CLÁR programme. The local improvement scheme has been reintroduced with a budget of €17 million, while 1,100 road projects have been completed across the country. I provided some funding for the Atlantic economic corridor to ensure the local authorities would have a dedicated person in place to deal with rural Ireland issues.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	The Minister is over time.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	I am very pleased with my Department and particularly the €1 billion I have available for the rural regeneration scheme. We have a very strong, good, efficient and hard working Department.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	They say that when one cannot answer a question, one should just keep talking. Does the Minister agree with me that issues such as rural transport, responsibility for the greenways which I believe would be far more appropriate to the Minister's Department in the context of rural recreation, marine leisure which, again, is just another form of rural recreation, the farm assist scheme, a sister scheme of the rural social scheme, the community employment and Tús schemes which are community schemes and policy on the Traveller community would be much better placed in his Department? Despite what he has said - obviously he must defend the citadel - it would show a real commitment to communities, both urban and rural, if these functions were transferred to the Minister. Would he like my assistance and that of the Opposition in getting these schemes transferred to his Department? Would he like us to start a vigorous campaign to ensure he will be given these enhanced powers? Does he want our help or not?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	I never refuse the Deputy's help. Any time he can help me I always take it. I will be honest with him. Yes, some of the schemes he mentioned would fit in my Department. I have already looked for some of them and some of the Departments want to give some of them to me. However, there is one problem. I need to have two things if I am to take over the schemes - money and staff. If I do not get the money or staff I need, I do not want the schemes. We took a scheme from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. It gave us the scheme and the money, but we had to employ our own staff. We did that, which is fine but, in the future, the simple answer is that if any scheme is to be given to my Department, I do not want it if I do not get the funding and the staff I need. Of course, I will take it if I receive the funding and the staff I need. Some of the projects mentioned by the Deputy such as the greenways and so forth would fit perfectly in my Department. I have no difficulty with this, provided there is the funding and staff available.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	The Taoiseach will fix it for the Minister.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	This question is about CLÁR funding for County Donegal. There were anomalies in the 2017 figures for CLÁR funding for the county. Can the Minister explain them? For example, County Donegal received 0.6% of the funding under measure one, even though it encompasses 6.4% of the district electoral divisions, DEDs. Overall, the funding the county received was 45% below the pro rata average. Will the Minister explain why County Donegal was granted significantly lower amounts of CLÁR funding vis-à-vis other counties in 2017?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	The 2017 CLÁR programme provided funding under four measures. Measure 1 provided support for safety measures around schools and community facilities, measure 2 supported play areas, measure 3 concerned targeted community infrastructure needs and measure 4 provided first response supports. My Department received more than 500 applications across the four measures. All applications received were assessed by my officials to determine whether they were eligible under the scheme criteria and whether all necessary supporting documentation, as required in the guidelines, was provided.  Unfortunately, a significant number of project applications that my Department received from Donegal County Council under measures 1 to 3 failed to meet the minimum standards for eligibility, or in the supporting documentation required. The CLÁR programme has historically contained some measures where groups, and in some cases individuals, applied directly to the Department for funding, depending on the measure concerned. In 2017, applications for funding under measure 4 were submitted directly to my Department by groups involved as first responders in emergency situations. I launched the 2018 CLÁR programme on 15 March with an indicative allocation of €5 million. The closing date for applications was 30 April. My officials will look at all applications to ensure they are eligible under the scheme's criteria and that all the supporting documentation requested has been provided. If, after these checks, the value of qualifying applications is greater than the funding available, my officials will have regard to any prioritisation given to the projects by the county councils or other organisations which submit applications.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	It is true that the documentation was not submitted by Donegal County Council. However, Donegal County Council had all the documentation to hand in the council offices. The Minister's staff never asked for it. On a number of occasions the Minister's staff were in discussion with Donegal County Council and his officials did not ask for the documentation to be forwarded to them. It was all there. I submit that the reason they did not ask for it was that they did not want it. They did not want to see significant amounts of funding going to a county like Donegal. I think other factors affect funding in that county. It is very interesting to look at the counties that received the maximum amount of funding. There are correlations there, but they have nothing to do with the location of CLÁR areas. I want to know what the Minister is going to do. Funding under measure 4 is at his discretion. That is fair enough. It is not under the discretion of the local authority. Will he confirm that a matrix of funding will be used in processing the 2018 applications in order to remove political factors from funding applications so that they are actually judged on their merits rather than on the basis of political expediency?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I reject what the Deputy says. I will just give him two pointers. I will outline what Deputy Pringle's council, Donegal County Council, did only last week. Every council agreed to the rules and regulations of the local improvement scheme, LIS, except Donegal. Every county was given an allocation of LIS funding, and each county was told to prioritise the roads. Deputy Pringle's county submitted €17 million worth of projects for me to prioritise. I will not do that. That is not my job. If the councillors and officials do not prioritise those schemes, I will not do it for them. I ran the CLÁR programme fairly and on a per capita basis, like every scheme that I have ever run, including the sports capital schemes. Deputy Pringle should not blame me or my officials because his county did not apply for the schemes properly. My officials have no more time to go back to inefficient county councils that could not put in the paperwork the way we did last year. I reject the Deputy's submission. I will put a few figures on the record of this Dáil, if the Chair does not mind. I do not like that kind of allegation from people like Deputy Pringle.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	In the Leader programme, Deputy Pringle's county got €1.475 million. Under the town and village renewal scheme it got €1.159 million. Under the CLÁR programme it received €245,488. Under the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme it got €104,000. Under the local improvements scheme - listen to this, loud and clear - it got €3.384 million, the most money given to any county in the country. If the county council had spent that money, they might not have needed me to prioritise the scheme for them. In total, Donegal got €9,000,038 from my Department last year. I can tell Deputy Pringle this: Donegal has a very good representative in the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, because he made strong representations. He is a good Minister of State and a good Deputy, and that is why Donegal got €9 million.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	That is a very interesting outline of all the funding our county got, except for the CLÁR funding. That is what this question was about. It was about CLÁR funding, over which the Minister has discretion. If one looks at the figures across the country, one sees where the funding went. It did not go to Donegal, I contest, because Donegal's votes were guaranteed. That is the reality of the situation. Donegal is in need of CLÁR funding. It has 6.4% of the district electoral divisions, DEDs, in CLÁR. The funding it received was 45% below the pro rata average for the country. We can go through the counties and see where the funding went. Will the Minister make sure that this will not happen in 2018, and that the funding will go to the counties that deserve it?
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	The Minister has already used all his time, so I will insist that he is very brief.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	I will send Deputy Pringle these figures, because I think he would understand how this scheme runs. Donegal got one of the highest allocations in the CLÁR programme last year. What is wrong with Deputy Pringle? Does he want me to give it all to Donegal? Donegal got €878,000 and 92% has been spent. Deputy Pringle should tell the county council to spend the other 8%. Donegal got almost €9 million from this Department last year. That includes funding under other Government schemes.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	I wish to ask the Minister for Rural and Community Development his plans for the 60th anniversary of Tidy Towns, if there are any special elements in the 2018 competition in view of the anniversary, and if he will make a statement on the matter.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	The year 2018 is very special for the SuperValu Tidy Towns Competition as it marks the 60th anniversary of what has been a very successful Government initiative. The work done by the Tidy Towns committees down through the years has played an important part in the improvement of the appearance of villages, towns and cities around the country. To assist committees to mark the 60th anniversary, I allocated funding of €1.4 million to Tidy Towns committees at the end of last year to help them prepare for the 2018 competition. I am delighted that more than 900 of the committees availed of the funding. Officials in my Department also carried out a nationwide consultation process with Tidy Towns committees last year in order to revise and update the competition. As a result of this process, a number of changes were implemented to simplify the application process. Other changes aimed at improving the competition will follow in due course. This year’s competition was launched on 28 March and includes a number of new special awards categories, including a schools award and an architectural award. A number of other initiatives to make this celebration year a memorable one for all the committees involved are being developed currently and details of these will be made available in due course.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I thank the Minister. Tidy Towns is a wonderful scheme. It has been in existence for 60 years and I want to compliment the Minister for the recognition that he gives to Tidy Towns organisations right across the State. I am a former treasurer of my local Tidy Towns committee in Clarecastle. The movement there has gone from strength to strength under the chairmanship of Mr. Christie Leyden and with the help of all the members. We have seen a transformation in our village. In last year's competition, Ennis was named as the tidiest large urban centre. That was wonderful as well. Ennis was joined by Kilrush, which was recognised as a gold medal winner in its category. I give the Minister credit for allocating €1.4 million to Tidy Towns last year. I also give him credit for bringing about some minor changes this year to bring schools on board and make architectural awards part of the scheme.When does the Minister expect to make the new details known and launch the scheme formally?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I thank the Deputy for his comments. Tidy Towns is probably one of the best schemes in the country. I know the Acting Chairman's county has done well in Tidy Towns over the years. I was delighted to allocate the €1.4 million and I did this in recognition of the work that people do in a voluntary capacity. To go back to the question I was asked, I call on all sporting organisations, businesses and communities to support for one year the Tidy Towns committees throughout the country. I am asking people to make a special effort on the 60th anniversary of the Tidy Towns committees. Perhaps a sporting organisation or a local factory could take a corner of a town or village and make an effort to improve it for one year. I call on all communities to give their support this year for the 60th anniversary. This was launched on 28 March and the closing date is 23 May. We will be writing to all Tidy Towns committees shortly to tell them of all the new schemes we are introducing and we have also had a consultation process with them. This is a great scheme and we should give these people a bit of assistance this year. It is left to the few in every small village and town. Why can everybody not give a bit of help for one year, given it is the 60th anniversary? I make a plea to everybody to come out and support them, even Members of the Oireachtas, and to get involved for one year in their Tidy Towns committee to make it a special 60th year. It is good for towns and villages and good for the country.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	I join the Minister's call to get sporting organisations and businesses to come on board to make a special effort in this 60th year. I also call on the Minister to provide additional funding as part of that recognition because it is a special year. While the Minister gave an allocation last year, we need to step up to the plate again and give due recognition to this wonderful organisation that works in a voluntary capacity in all our towns and villages throughout the State.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	The Deputy has put it up to me. I responded last year because I have seen the work they do in every county, town and village. To me, it is not a grant or money for them. It is an investment in the country, given what they do for the community and the country. I had responsibility for the national parks at one time and I saw the dumping that is happening in towns and villages, particularly in rural areas. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, and I allocated funding recently in regard to sophisticated measures to try to catch people who are dumping. Why should some people be cleaning up after others? We want to see more prosecutions and we want to support those who keep our communities, towns and villages clean and tidy. They deserve to be supported. On behalf of the Government and the Oireachtas, and on my own behalf, I thank all those involved in the Tidy Towns committees throughout the country. Sometimes we see them criticised, whether on Facebook or elsewhere, but I thank them for the work they do.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	Deputy Carey did not get the money yet.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I am delighted that the Minister has got the community services programme back, although I am very disappointed to hear he did not get the staff. It often seems that Departments run their operations as if they were independent empires rather than part of a collective Government, although that is not the Minister's fault. My question concerns the plans to expand this scheme. There are many community facilities that are not used to their potential and many tourist facilities in community hands that could be drawing many more people into communities who would then stay there, shop there, eat meals there and so on. What plans has the Minister to expand this and has he got the backing of the Department and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for those plans?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together. The community services programme, or CSP, was transferred to my Department on 1 January 2018. The programme supports 400 community organisations to provide local services through a social enterprise model, with funding provided as a contribution to the cost of a manager and an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions. Some €46 million will be provided under the programme in 2018. My current priority is to maintain the level of service for the organisations funded under the programme and to monitor its progress over the coming months. Thereafter, the Department will undertake a thorough review, commencing in early autumn 2018. The review will consider, among other things, how the programme fits with overall Government priorities, as well as my Department’s other community programmes and its policy objectives. It will also consider potential crossover with my Department’s forthcoming national policy on social enterprise. I recently approved €815,000 for 12 social enterprises following a call for applications issued in 2017 under strand 3 of the programme. Additional calls for proposals will be considered upon completion of the review and in light of available funding. That said, my Department will continue to accept expressions of interest under the CSP in 2018 and I expect to approve funding for additional social enterprises during the year as funding becomes available as part of the ongoing management of the programme.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	From his reply, it would appear that what the Minister is doing is recycling the money. Some schemes get a reduced number of full-time equivalents and he is transferring them. One thing that all of us puzzle about, and we have often talked about it among ourselves, is the fact there are still a large number of people drawing jobseeker's allowance long-term who will never get commercial jobs. Let us be honest about it. They could provide fantastic services in the community through this scheme if there were to be a transfer to the Minister's Department of some of the welfare that is going with these people and if he were given the top-up by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Are there negotiations under way to ensure that kind of lateral thinking in government rather than the silo effect that goes on all the time and which we are all, as politicians, subject to at times?
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	While I welcome the fact the scheme has been transferred to the Department, I was slightly disappointed with the Minister's response where he said a review of the scheme would take place later in the year. I would have thought that review should be under way as we speak and I am not sure why there would be a delay in that taking place. I acknowledge there were expressions of interest last year and that the Minister has recently announced a dozen new projects. These were restricted to strand 3 specifically, however, and I understand projects that did not meet strand 3 criteria were declined funding, although they may be assessed in the future. Nonetheless, the demand is real and it is there today, both from individuals, as outlined by Deputy Ó Cuív, and from communities. In regard to strand 1, there are many community facilities that could avail of this programme, especially in areas of disadvantage. My concern is that it is like a drip feed. The scheme is turned on and off and there is no continuity in terms of access to the programme. While I know this is budget related and budget specific, I would like to see a more transparent and consistent scheme being designed.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	With regard to the review, we only got this programme at the end of last year and we took it over from 1 January. My first priority was to make sure that the programme continued. As the Deputies said, this is a very important programme and I did not want any delay in regard to it continuing and the programme being put in place, so that was my priority. We need a review of the scheme, and I want to respond to the points made by the two Deputies, many of which I agree with. The scheme supports more than 2,000 jobs. There are 1,600 people employed and 306 managers, and I have provided €815,000 for 12 new social enterprises. I like this scheme. Deputy Ó Cuív referred to the people who are on the scheme.It is important that we give them an opportunity to be in the workplace and give back to society. Work is being done in terms of social protection and discussions on these schemes are constantly being held. However, I must be careful in that some of them are social enterprises and meet social needs. I do not want to affect schemes that are performing a good for society that no Department, local authority or agency is addressing. Without such schemes, communities would not have access to certain services. My first priority is to protect them and their funding and prevent something from being introduced that would affect them negatively in any way. I will want the Deputies' support in that regard, as these important schemes are working.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	I am sorry, but the Minister will have a final minute in which to reply.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	That is fine. I thank the Acting Chairman.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	I do not like interrupting, but I am trying to keep to the time limits.

Is the Minister personally consulted before any scheme is reduced or closed? Pobal has previously made bad recommendations regarding the kinds of service in question. Will the Minister reassure me that no scheme will be reduced or closed without his personal say so? As part of the review, will the Minister consider costing a doubling of the scheme's size? More than 2,000 full-time equivalents would be needed to provide all of the community services, some of which have a semi-economic basis, while others are of significant social importance, for example, community halls, while also generating some income. The Minister's costing could take into account the savings that would be made in the social welfare budget. It is all taxpayers' money. If the State saves with one hand and spends with the other, the taxpayer only has to worry about the net cost.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	I welcome the Minister's statement that he will pay close attention to ensuring none of the existing schemes will be adversely affected by the review. One of the advantages of having the programme in the then Department of Social Protection was that, if savings were made on jobseekers' payments, there could be a supplementary budget and transferring funding internally was easier.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	Yes.

Regardless of whether they are projects with tourism features like the ones Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív indicated or community facilities, they play a vital role. I urge the Minister to accelerate the review. Our frustration is that emerging communities are shut out from the programme. That is the problem. If people move from the live register onto this programme, there is an additional cost to the Minister's Department, but there is a saving elsewhere. Joined-up Government thinking is needed in order that these funds can flow from one Department to the other.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	The Minister should try to keep his answer as tight as possible.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	I inherited a budget of €45 million for this year, although it was subsequently increased to €46 million. I will negotiate with the rest of the Government for further funding for next year. We must remember that the programme has only been running since 1 January. I would like to see further funding for it, but the problem lies with the existing budget. For new schemes to come on line, others must be dropped. That is the problem. Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív asked about Pobal, which administers the programme's schemes, and I will give him an honest answer. It notifies me of schemes that will be dropped. I have ministerial authority to reject that decision, but the Deputy knows that the minute I do so, I will face more allegations like those made in the Chamber this morning about interfering in the process.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	I have already seen it happen. I asked Pobal to review a number of its decisions with which I was not happy. It is reviewing them. It receives a great deal of criticism, but it has a professional team and makes good decisions 99.9% of the time. I support it in that regard. I need to examine the appeals mechanism and will do so. I have spoken to Pobal about this matter and, to be fair, it has accepted the need to do so.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I thank the Minister for his co-operation.

Will he explain the Department's review of the programme and when will it be complete? Will he assure the House that the funding provided under the programme will remain targeted at the areas of greatest disadvantage?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	Officials in my Department are carrying out a review of the RAPID programme, with a view to developing an expanded and enhanced programme to support disadvantaged communities. The overall aim is to ensure communities get the most benefit from any available funding and that funding is delivered to those who need it most in as efficient a manner as possible. Matters being considered include whether the programme should be amalgamated with the communities facilities scheme, an examination of the method of allocating funding under the programme and other more administrative issues. The funding will continue to be channelled through the local community development committee, LCDC, structure because such committees are best placed to identify the most suitable projects locally. The review process included an invitation for feedback from the LCDCs. The review is almost complete and I hope to make an announcement on a new programme in the coming weeks.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	I thank the Minister for his response. Since I submitted this question I have since received some information because of my concern that the funding made available for the programme in 2017 was not necessarily targeted at the areas of most disadvantage. The Minister allocated €64,500 to each local authority in 2017. My local authority covers more than one RAPID programme area. I have discovered that one project received €32,000, but it is the only RAPID programme area in my constituency - it is in north Clondalkin - and the project is a general one serving the entire constituency, not just the targeted area. I do not want to be critical of the project because it is a good one; rather, my point is that the RAPID programme area in north Clondalkin did not receive targeted funding. I have the specific details for the Minister. If we are to run a true RAPID programme, the areas of most disadvantage must be recognised and their communities' needs met but the latter did not happen in 2017. Instead, there was a general spend across a wider area.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I accept the Deputy's comments. That is why I am reviewing the scheme. As the Deputy has been fair, I will be fair in response. The scheme had not been open since 2008. When we set up the new Department last year, I was anxious to receive funding. A criticism made by local authorities and LCDCs was that I had allocated the funding too late. What I am hoping to do with the new scheme is to identify the areas of most need. Last year approximately €64,000 of the national total of €2 million was given to each local authority. Some €3.5 million has been ring-fenced for Dublin's inner city. The Deputy and I both know that other areas in Dublin also face problems. They need to be identified, targeted and supported. I hope to be able to do so and have the programme announced by the end of May. That is the reason for the review. I do not want to see funding going to areas that do not need it; it should be targeted. I happened to be in inner city Dublin recently and was pleased to see the way in which the funding was targeted, for example, playschools for mothers and toddlers, as well as other schemes. I was proud of how it was all working. We were targeting the areas that needed funding the most.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	Is there a final comment?
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	There is. The Minister is proud of the success of the scheme in the north-east inner city, but my concern is that, although he identified the amount of funding that had gone to that area, areas of significant disadvantage in other parts of Dublin are only receiving a sum of €32,000. That amount is not proportionate to the challenges facing them. It is welcome that the Minister has reopened the programme. He must ensure funding goes to those areas. In my constituency the RAPID programme area is north Clondalkin. There are other areas of disadvantage, but the area of greatest disadvantage has been identified. Funding should go to it.The Minister will have to fight for the funding required. I acknowledge he can be dogged and determined, and we will support him in this. Funding of €2 million for a national programme is not significant enough, considering that the Minister is putting more into the inner city alone than the rest of the country. He is seeing the result of this, which testifies to the benefit of the programme. I want to see in every disadvantaged community investment at a scale that will bring meaningful results.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	I cannot disagree with anything the Deputy says. I would love to have more funding. I will have to try to get more. This is a very important scheme. The day any Government or society forgets about the people in need, who need to be targeted, supported and helped, is a sad one. That is why the scheme is up and running now. I have had it reviewed and can now consider ways of targeting to ensure needs are met. Last year, there was a serious difficulty at Cherry Orchard. I allocated €100,000 at the end of the year to support that community in addressing its difficulties. Inner-city Dublin is affected but the Deputy is quite correct that this is not just a Dublin problem; there are problems all over the country. Local authority funding of €64,000 was made available. I would love to see a lot more funding than that. I must consider, however, all the other programmes, including the SICAP and the committees programme. There are many other programs to support and target. There is not just one programme; there are many others. I want to ensure we do not operate in a piecemeal way and that we consider all the programmes to ensure they are all targeting the right areas and that we are not trying to spread resources too much. I accept the comments of the Deputy and I am reviewing the scheme. I am considering operating the communities programme along with it. These are two small programmes and it would be better to target the areas that need resources must.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	If all Deputies, including Ministers, co-operate, we might just get six questions answered. We are two questions behind so I ask everybody to obey the time constraints to be fair to those who are hoping their questions will be answered. I understand it is often necessary to take a few seconds more than allocated but the Members should try to adhere to the time allowed.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	It has been agreed that Deputy Penrose will ask the questions on behalf of Deputy Sherlock. I am sure nobody has any difficulty with that.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	As the Minister knows, I have been pursuing this vigorously. I am eager to ascertain the status of the public banking investigation carried out by the Government. The Minister's Department and the Department of Finance have recently completed a report examining whether a model of community or public banking could work here. The Minister said it will be published in the coming weeks and that he is engaged with Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation, which is the international development wing of the German Sparkassen public banks. I am eager to ascertain what progress has been made. I acknowledge the Minister is on top of it and is supportive but I do not trust the Department of Finance.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 31 together. The programme for a partnership Government includes a commitment to investigate a new model of community banking for Ireland, including an investigation of the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks that operate within well-defined regions. A project team comprising officials from my Department and the Department of Finance was established last year to make progress on this commitment. The project team carried out detailed research into the concept of a public banking model, with a particular focus on the Sparkassen model. In addition, a public consultation process seeking views on the concept of a community banking model ran for four weeks. A range of key stakeholders were invited to comment on the proposed new model of community banking, including the credit union representative bodies. Members of the Oireachtas were also advised of the consultation process. Two credit union representative bodies submitted very comprehensive responses describing the extent of their work and the impact they have on rural communities throughout the country. Their responses have been assessed in detail and their views will be reflected in the forthcoming report on the public banking review. Additionally, there has been substantial engagement and a number of meetings held with the body referred to by Deputy Penrose, who has been raising this for many years. The departmental officials have finalised their report and have submitted their findings to the Minister for Finance and me. The report will be brought to Government for approval in the coming weeks.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I thank the Minister but I am deeply concerned by the obstinate view of the Department of Finance. The German model of public banking falls between the private commercial banks that we are used to in Ireland and the credit union movement. These banks would offer the same kinds of loans as commercial banks currently offer but with more favourable terms. Clearly, the banks are not nationalised like AIB. The public banking model has existed in Germany for over 200 years. The banks are municipally owned and are not for profit. The clear objective is lending into the regional economy. Such banks would fill the void that has clearly been left behind by the pillar banks, which, as the Minister is aware and has heard in recent pronouncements, are rapidly disengaging from rural Ireland. All they are interested in is more technology and removing the human face from banking. The poor unfortunate bank workers, tellers and others who are left behind are absolutely overloaded. It is a disgrace. One has only to see what Ms McDonagh of Bank of Ireland and others in AIB have been doing in recent weeks to realise this. The general public remains sceptical about the mainstream banks. How could it be any other way when the sole focus is bringing back the discredited bonus system? The Minister now has a chance to give the pillar banks a right booting because that is what they deserve. They are deserting the ordinary people of this country. This is a chance for us to fill the void.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	I call the Minister. He should please keep to the time.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	I thank Deputy Penrose. I want to be fair to him because he has been raising this for a long time. I really mean it when I say the report has been produced and will be before the Government in the next two weeks. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and I have read the report. We have to bring it before the Cabinet. We will publish it as quickly as possible after it considers it. I agree with the Deputy on some of the comments he made. There is a problem and I am hearing every single day as a rural Deputy, not as a Minister, how banks are dealing with consumers. We do need a bit of competition in the market. Banks have certainly lost the sense of what they used to do and are certainly not there for the people anymore. They are there for themselves, not for the ordinary general public who need banking services. The banks no longer want to take cash and they do not want to give out loans. I do not know what they want to do any longer. There are many complaints. Small businesses are finding out daily that they cannot obtain the credit they need, nor can they get the supports.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	The public banking model in Germany operates under municipal trusteeship. The salary ranges of Sparkassen staff are basically identical to the civil servant arrangements. Bonuses for staff are not common practice. Salary arrangements comprise a success story and there is customer satisfaction. The pillar banks here would not get a penny if it was based on customer satisfaction. They would not get a shilling. Some of the big managers would lose some of their wages. Bonuses for staff are not common practice in the German public banking model. Mr. Seamus Boland, CEO of Irish Rural Link, said this alternative system of banking would in many ways complement mainstream banking. It is important to relay to the bureaucrats in the Department of Finance, whom I know are the obstacle, that Mr. Boland states: "Failure to develop an alternative banking system on the lines proposed, will condemn our regions to being unable to develop in economic terms for the foreseeable future." I know what the banks did during the hard times. They took away overdrafts of €5,000 and €6,000 from unfortunate small businesses and let them go to the wall. They looked after the big shots and the small people suffered. This is the void we are trying to fill. We want to take on the pillar banks through competition. Sparkassen, the credit union movement and the post offices are ready to do so. The Minister should complete the job.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	All I can tell the Deputy is that we want to get this to the Cabinet. We want to get the report published. I would love to see more competition in the banking market. I will try to get my job done, get the report to the Cabinet as quickly as possible, have it published and then see where we are.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	Deputy Breathnach will put the question. I am sure that is agreed by the House.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I apologise on behalf of Deputy Brendan Smith. Deputy John Curran said the Minister is dogged but I would say he is a Rottweiler this morning. I thank him for the funding that comes from his Department. The two questions concern the discussions the Minister has had with his Northern counterparts and other officials in respect of the funding of fundamental cross-Border projects and the dealings he has had with the European Commission, particularly on PEACE programmes and their continuation in the vacuums that exist, whether they arise from Brexit or the lack of devolved government in the North.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 28 together. PEACE IV supports peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland, promoting social and economic stability, particularly through actions which promote cohesion between communities.  It is co-funded by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund.   My Department is accountable and provides funding under three themes - shared spaces and services, building positive relations, and children and young people. My Department's primary role in developing projects is as an adviser on the PEACE IV steering committee, together with other relevant Departments in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The steering committee which is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body as part of its overall management of PEACE IV considers and approves all funding applications.  Discussions between my Department and counterpart Departments in Northern Ireland take place primarily within the steering committee process, engaging directly on specific projects from time to time, when necessary. The Government is committed to securing agreement on successor programmes post-2020 and continuing the deep cross-Border co-operation that is the hallmark of the current cross-Border programmes.  In that regard, I am pleased that both the European Union and the United Kingdom have committed to examining favourably support for the programmes post-2020. My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has overall responsibility for the PEACE programme and engaging with the European Commission, including programme funding post-2020. However, I expect my Department to contribute strongly to the shape of any new programme as discussions progress.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	I understand the use of the words "favourably considering". We all respect the fact that a commitment is in place until 2020 from the British Government and the European Union to fund the programme to which the Minister of State referred. Where there is a vacuum is in the planning processes of organisations such as the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, the east Border region and the local authorities. Looking into the future at fundamental projects that need to be supported on a North-South basis, we can see that we have a problem. The programmes are essential in achieving progress both in rural and urban places along the Border which have suffered for many years. The European Union recognises other countries that are not in the Union and there are many programmes outside an EU structure. It is important to explore that option and bed it down in advance of a possible Brexit to help to continue to support the peace process.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	I absolutely agree with the Deputy. The value of the current PEACE programme is circa €270 million, including the Irish and UK matching funding, with €229 million from the European Union and €40.5 million from the Irish and UK Governments. The latter figure is composed of €8.75 million from the Irish Government and €31.7 million from the UK Government. Some 85% is funded from the European Regional Development Fund. The funding is expected to be fully committed before the end of 2018. Obviously the long-term objective is to secure a successor programme beyond 2020. In terms of engaging, agreement has been reached between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland on a safeguard clause for funding agreements with programme beneficiaries in the light of Brexit. It will Brexit-proof letters of offer to the greatest extent possible and give programme beneficiaries assurances as to the legal and financial commitments into which they are entering, thus allowing them to plan for the future with confidence. Work is being undertaken by officials in my Department with officials from Northern Ireland to ensure there will be certainty as we move towards Brexit.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	I recognise the funding to which the Minister of State has referred. However, the overall figure that has been contributed to the Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo means that it would be a catastrophe if the funding was to slow down. Any Deputy from these Border counties could be asking questions about this matter. It is imperative that we redouble our efforts to ensure both communities, the local authorities, businesses and the progress achieved during the peace process will never be forgotten. There are many communities along the Border and further north and south which have been impacted on by the Troubles. It is essential that we continue these programmes and enhance them. They have become essential to the Border region in how local authorities operate and communities benefit. I welcome the Minister of State's answer and want to assure him and the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring, that I came into the Dáil Chamber in the first instance to co-operate with others in enhancing communities.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	I concur with the Deputy. Obviously he is from the Border region; therefore, he has much more first-hand experience of what happened in the past. We are fully committed to ensuring there will be a successor programme. My Department will provide €6 million for projects over the lifetime of the programme, with a matching contribution of €33 million to be provided by the European Union. The remaining Exchequer contribution of €3 million is to be provided by the Department of Education and Skills under the programmes I listed, including a number of projects that relate to children and young people, the local authority children and young people's programme, the shared spaces and services capital development projects, local authority shared spaces projects, shared spaces for victims and survivors and building positive relations on local authority action plans and regional level projects. There are a range of funding streams, with funding from my Department and the European Union. It is important that we ensure this funding stream continue into the future.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	I want to ask the Minister about the allocations, both nationally and in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim and south Donegal, under the local improvement scheme since its reintroduction in 2017. Will there be another allocation this year? I congratulate the Minister because for roughly ten years no money was spent on local improvement schemes-----
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	The Deputy has introduced his question. I am sorry to interject, but I want to allow time for two further questions.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	The local improvement scheme, LIS, is a programme for improvement works on small private and non-public roads. The scheme is funded by my Department and administered through the local authorities. In September 2017, following a number of years when there was no dedicated funding for the scheme, I approved €10 million in funding for it. I allocated a further €7.4 million for the scheme from savings made elsewhere in my Department's Vote at the end of November 2017.  The total allocation of €17.4 million for the scheme in 2017 included allocations of €496,158 to Sligo County Council and €487,947 to Leitrim County Council.  Following on from the successful relaunch of the scheme in 2017, I announced details of the 2018 local improvement scheme on 27 February.  I have allocated an initial amount of €10.8 million to county councils across the country under the scheme this year. The funding includes allocations of €282,000 to Sligo County Council and €250,000 to Leitrim County Council. Detailed information on the roads selected by the Sligo and Leitrim County Councils for improvement works in 2018 can be found on my Department’s website. As part of the 2018 local improvement scheme, I also requested each county council to compile a secondary list of suitable road projects which they would have the capacity to complete should additional funding become available through my Department later in the year.  I will be monitoring the position in the context of my Department's overall expenditure performance in the coming months.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	92	I thank the Minister. I welcome the money the constituency has received since 2017. I am aware that offers have been made to a number of farmers and householders living along the routes of the local improvement schemes which have been approved by both Sligo County Council and Leitrim County Council. I believe the money that has been spent there and in every constituency in the country is to be welcomed. Every councillor in the country has been lobbying, with the aim of improving private roads for farming. In many cases, this means that the roads are brought up to a standard where they can be taken in charge by the local authorities in the various areas involved.  The Minister has allocated a sum of €10.8 million this year. I hope additional funding can be made available for local improvement schemes. It is money well spent spent and which has been taken up in every area, particularly in the areas I represent, in Sligo-Leitrim and south Donegal. It is vitally important that we receive additional funding in 2018, but I certainly welcome the €10.8 million allocated so far.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	I have tabled a similar question that we probably will not reach. People are grateful to get this money. Last year there was €17 million, but this year it is down to €10 million. People are concerned that it has been clawed back by that much. Will the Minister assure us that new money or more money will be found for the rest of the year? Although the €17 million spent last year did a tremendous amount of work, there had been ten years of nothing. We ought to see an increase in the funding available from last year rather than a decrease. I hope the Minister will find the extra funds for this in the future.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	I welcome the call. The Minister made money available last year and I hope that he can make more available this year. It makes a big difference to the quality of life of people in rural areas living on these roads.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	I thank the three Deputies. The scheme has been very successful. This scheme had been closed for several years and has now reopened. Funding has been allocated to 1,100 roads until the end of the year. This year's budget voted €10 million, which I have increased to €10.7 million. I will seek savings in my Department and if I have further funds available this year, I will look at the local improvement scheme, LIS, as an area in which I can spend this. I took €7.7 million in savings last year and put it into the LIS at the end of the year. That is why I have asked local authorities to give us the list, and to be fair, most local authorities have given me their priority lists. I have grant aided funding to them and asked them to come up with a second list. I will write to them again to prioritise that secondary list. If I have extra funds, that is where it will go. Deputy Scanlon is correct. This scheme has worked very well. I want to clarify something for Deputy Calleary and others. I do not pick the schemes. The local authorities pick the schemes, and I want to put that on the record.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	I believe you.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	97	That is what the Minister is telling them.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	The Deputies can look at the Ballina schemes and the number there. All I can tell them is that I did not pick them.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	The Minister might write to them and tell them that.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	I am delighted that my colleagues have come in to support this request. We have delivered the money over the past two years. For ten years we had no money whatever. From the Minister's track record, I hope that additional funding will be made available to the €10.7 million so far for 2018. The upgrading of roads in recent years has benefited communities, as was the case with previous local improvement schemes. I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, has seen the benefits in his own constituency of Roscommon, and will associate himself with those. I thank the Minister and hope that we will continue with this local improvement scheme. It is great for local authorities which have been starved of funding for many years. It provides additional work and is good for local councillors who have lobbied for it.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	101	On a serious note, I reiterate that I do not pick the schemes. I will look at the local authorities, and Deputy Ó Cuív supports me on this. They look for the local contribution and charge an administrative fee for the scheme. I looked at one scheme recently which cost €21,000. The Department had allocated €26,000 and the council had taken €3,000 to €4,000 from this sum for administering the scheme. I gave it €865,000 and I expect that €865,000 to be spent on roads, not on administration.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	Hear, hear.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	103	That is something that needs to be looked at. An issue which Deputy Ó Cuív raised has raised before, which I have raised with officials, and Deputy McLoughlin also brought up is the charges per square metre for roads. I want the Department to do some work on this because I want to see the €10.7 million this year, or the €17.7 million last year, put into roads. The local authority staff would be there anyway. I should not have to pay an administration fee on top of the cost of the roads, not to mention the local authorities charging €20 per square metre. That does not make sense when the private sector can do it for around €13 to €15. The scheme is a good one which I want to continue. I know the Acting Chairman admires it because many roads were done in Roscommon and he knows more will be done this year.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	104	That is the last comment on that matter. We will move on.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	We are very tight for time. Will Deputy McLoughlin forgo his introduction and we will get the answer?
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	I will, if the Acting Chairman lets me in afterwards.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	I will indeed.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	The number of approved participants in the seniors alert scheme in 2017 in the areas in question were 276 in Sligo and 182 in Leitrim. Following the launch of a new scheme which took effect on 1 November 2017, my Department conducted a very successful nationwide public awareness campaign aimed at older people, their extended families and friends who may not have been aware of the scheme. The key features of the new scheme include a self-declaration of limited means for eligibility, a person no longer having to live alone to qualify, free monitoring of the alarm service for the first year, and an increase in administrative payments to community groups involved in rolling out the scheme. I am pleased to say that since the launch of the new scheme, the demand has been unprecedented. Spend in 2017 amounted to almost €2.7 million, compared with €1.8 million spent in 2016. During 2017, in excess of 12,700 applications were approved and more than 10,000 installations were completed. In the first three months of 2018, in excess of 6,000 applications were approved. I encourage anyone who is interested in the seniors alert scheme to contact Pobal which operates the scheme on my Department’s behalf.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	I thank the Minister for the reply. Awareness, through Pobal and other agencies involved in promoting the seniors alert scheme, is most important. I have seen it at first hand. Almost 500 people have participated in it in my constituency in Sligo and Leitrim in the past year, and I am sure many others would do so if people were aware that they do not need to live alone for this alert system to be put in place. We see vandalism and robberies in the countryside and people suffer ill health. I have seen many people whose lives have been saved as a result of this system. It is vital that we encourage Pobal to advertise this service. Will the Minister say if there has been an advertising campaign to raise awareness? Many people are working in this area in their communities but there are many others who are not aware of it.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	110	I took this scheme on board last year because, as the Deputy notes, we had many problems in the countryside, especially with criminal gangs who were targeting elderly people. People must be safe in their homes. The initial take-up was not large. In 2015, 1,321 took up the scheme. In 2016, it was 7,301 and, because of the Department's campaign which targeted local radio and newspapers and informed every Deputy in the House, 12,609 people took up the scheme last year. As of the end of March, 6,109 people have signed up this year. The campaign worked very well. I want to see people being able to stay in their homes and live there without being frightened. This is a good scheme, and if anyone knows anybody who wants to take it up, they should contact Pobal or the community groups which are dealing with it. The scheme has worked well and I may have to find extra funding for it this year, which shows how well it worked.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	111	There is no better man than the Minister to get additional money. It is crucial if there is extra demand for the scheme and I am sure that there will be. The Minister is correct. There are many agencies involved. An awareness campaign helps. I am sure every Deputy here will have seen how concerned people are in their homes in recent years, and how they are live prisoners in their homes. If they have this resource, they have contact with the outside world when they lock their doors at night.The campaign the Minister has launched is very innovative. It is vitally important that we continue it this year and in years to come so that everybody can avail of this facility.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	112	We made a number of changes to the scheme last year and we made it easier for people. They do not have to pay for the first year of monitoring because the Department pays for it. The scheme has been very successful and I am delighted that so many people have availed of it. I compliment all the community groups, particularly Pobal, on the public shows they held around the country which led to the massive take-up. The most important thing is that elderly people feel safe in their homes. It has worked so well that we are going to have to find further funding for it this year.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	Last night, the Minister for Health revealed that there were more than 1,500 additional cervical cases which had not been audited. This shocking and out-of-the-blue revelation confirms that the response to this crisis to date from the Minister and the Department of Health has been neither competent nor comprehensive. It is now two weeks since the Minister was told about the issue and nearly a week since it became public, yet we are still discovering shocking and unsettling new information. The Taoiseach and the Government have had enough time to get on top of this issue and they need to do so urgently. As Vicky Phelan said last night on "Prime Time", there is no one leading this and the news is changing daily. Ministers have run to the hills and TV programmes have been absent of senior Ministers to explain things to the public. Calm, competent authority is required in response to this crisis. Confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme is being undermined and women throughout the country are fearful and worried. They have been let down. Despite everything, it is worth reminding people that this cervical cancer screening programme has identified up to 50,000 precancerous changes in women without symptoms and has made a very positive contribution to women's health. The most effective route to restoring confidence is to have a competent, comprehensive inquiry that will get to the truth. The precise model is not actually the key. The key is the chair, the personnel and the terms of reference. Yesterday there was more uncertainty. The Government had spoken about a HIQA inquiry while, last night in the middle of a debate, we apparently moved to a commission of inquiry. We urgently need clarity. This morning we learn from a story in The Irish Times that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, approved in writing that the director general of the HSE be allowed to take up a lucrative role at a US contraceptive manufacturer. I have no personal axe to grind with Mr. O'Brien, though I did have issues with the manner of his appointment by the then Minister, now Senator James Reilly, in the absence of a public competition. I believe the Minister made a serious error in consenting to this because if there is not a conflict of interest, there is a potential conflict of interest. I do not believe one can be director of the HSE and a member of the board of a health product manufacturer. In addition, the chairman of Evofem, the company in question, is Thomas Lynch who is chair of the board of Ireland East hospital group and the Mater Hospital. It is reasonable to say that a HSE director should devote the whole of his working time to his job as director, as per HSE policy and earlier statements. Does the Taoiseach believe both positions are reconcilable? Does he agree that the Minister erred in making the decision to give consent to Mr. O'Brien taking this up, two months before he announced that he was going to retire as director general of the HSE in August? What steps is the Taoiseach now going to take to authoritatively deal with this crisis? Could we have some clarity, which is badly needed, on the form of the inquiry being proposed by the Government? 
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	Once again, I want to say how deeply concerned and upset I and the whole Government are at the situation with which we are now grappling. We still do not know all the facts, and last night, as Members will be aware, new information was given to the Minister only a short time before he came into this House to make a statement and answer questions. He was put in the unenviable position of disclosing information to the House without having all the information himself, and we certainly do not have all the information. I ask for some time and space to allow us to establish the facts and space for calm and for facts, which the Leader of the Opposition mentioned. There is an old piece of wisdom, which is, "Act in haste, repent at leisure." Whatever we do, I want to make sure we do the right thing. I do not want us to act in haste, make the wrong decision collectively, and then be sorry for it into the future. I know that many women in Ireland are very worried about this and many are feeling very vulnerable today. As a Taoiseach, as a doctor, and as a brother of two sisters, I want to say a few things. First, this controversy relates to women who were already diagnosed with cervical cancer and are receiving treatment. There are many women in the country at the moment who are worried that they might have cancer and worried that the HSE and CervicalCheck know that and have not told them. That is not the case. Nobody is going to get a phone call or letter in the next few days to tell them that they have cancer and that it had been concealed from them in some way. There are also many women who are worried about their smear tests, many of whom I have met in recent days. They are women who have a had a smear test recently, been given the all-clear, and are now wondering if that is true. I can reassure them that if they have been given the all-clear, it is true. There is a margin of error in these tests but it is under 1%, as is the case with all screening programmes internationally. We have no reason to believe that the information people have been given, to the effect that their tests are clear, is untrue. If anybody is concerned, we invite them to visit their GP to discuss the situation and we will meet the cost of the consultation and the repeat smear test. I thank the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO for their co-operation in this regard. To the women of Ireland, I want to say that I am determined to get to the bottom of this, to establish the facts and to restore confidence in our cancer screening system. A number of actions have been agreed this morning. First, we are going to ask a team of expert international cytopathologists to carry out a clinical review and to look again at the smears of all the women who were diagnosed with cancer in the past ten years. We do not have the exact figure but it is between 2,000 and 3,000. We will most likely find out that the majority of the additional 1,500, of whom we spoke yesterday, never had a smear test. The review will be led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and will try to identify the genuine false negatives and those cases which should have been reported differently. We believe this can be completed by the end of May. Later this year, we are also going to bring in a new, more accurate smear test and we will be among the first countries in the world to do this. There will still be false negatives but not as many as in the past.This test will be available to all women who want it. They will not have to wait three years for their routine appointment. This will be expensive and logistically difficult but it is something we need to do. There will be a statutory inquiry. There are limitations to a HIQA inquiry. We know what they are. There are problems also with a commission of inquiry and we know what they are as well. There is a committee hearing today. We would like that committee hearing to take place as it provides an opportunity for many of the senior officials and senior doctors to answer some questions. Following the hearing, the Minister for Health will invite the spokespeople to meet him to discuss the best form of inquiry that should take place.

The House will be aware that Dr. Gráinne Flannelly, the clinical director of CervicalCheck, stepped down some days ago. I would like to inform the House that the senior official in charge in CervicalCheck, the director of CervicalCheck, is no longer in charge. Damien McCallion has been assigned to take over operations at CervicalCheck.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	I asked the Taoiseach the serious question of whether or not he agreed that the Minister for Health had made a serious error in facilitating and consenting in writing to the director general of the HSE serving on a board of a company and he studiously avoided dealing with it. I would like an answer from the Taoiseach, first, on whether he believes the Minister made the correct decision in consenting to this and, second, if he thinks Mr. O'Brien's position on that board is reconcilable with his being a director general of the HSE, with all the inevitable potential conflict of interests that arise from such membership of that board, the personnel involved and so forth? I put it to the Taoiseach that confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme has been undermined by the drip, drip feed of information and shocking new revelations. I do not think anyone on this side of the House could accuse the Taoiseach of acting in haste; the opposite is the case. I agree with Vicky Phelan that no one seems to be leading on this issue. There is no calm authority getting to grips with this crisis, and there has not been for the last two weeks, unfortunately. The only way we can get confidence in the cervical cancer screening programme is to exercise such authority and make clear decisions. I welcome the peer review of the cytology tests and so on but the Government needs to make clear decisions and to operate on the basis of being totally in charge of this issue, such that it is not going in all directions, as it was over the last two weeks. We need to get to grips with this issue.

There is no conflict of interest with this appointment as the company does not have a relationship with the HSE and it does not trade in Ireland. Also, the Minister in approving it was aware that Mr. O'Brien was coming to the end of his term of office, which ends in 12 weeks' time. It is on that basis that the Minister approved it. I have no reason to question the validity of that decision. The work he is doing for that company, I am told, is five hours per month and this will be done in his own time and any board meetings he will be on annual leave. On the drip, drip of information, I appreciate what the Deputy says. I do not want to be in a situation whereby my Ministers and I do not have all of the information to hand. We are working as hard as we can on this matter. The Government has been focused in the last number of days on getting all of the information together so that we can make the right decisions.  When I referred to "haste", I was referring to something different. I was referring to something which I think we should not do as a House, or as a Government, which is to make decisions without having all the information. I would ask the House for some calm and the time and space to establish all of the facts in order that we can take charge of this situation. I have listed a number of actions that we are taking.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	121	Vicky Phelan's solicitor has been adamant in his description of the behaviour of the HSE in regard to his client. He has described it as a cover-up. To be honest, I was not 100% sure if that was the right description but I am now. I am now convinced that we are faced with a cover-up by the HSE and for the following reasons. We and the general public were previously led to believe that all smear tests were subjected to a review where a woman later developed cervical cancer having had a clear smear. Some 208 women was the final number put into the public domain. Then last night the Minister, Deputy Harris, came into the Dáil and told us that "a potentially considerable number of cases were not subjected to audit". We are now advised that approximately 1,500 more women, who may have been put at risk because of errors in the reading of their smear tests, are now affected. Another 1,500 women potentially were left in the dark just as Vicky Phelan was. In the midst of a debacle centred on the withholding of vital information by the HSE - life and death information - we are now told that there was more misinformation and that more women are potentially caught up in this scandal. This is breathtaking, Taoiseach. It is increasing evidence that this controversy is not simply a case of catastrophic dysfunction; it is a case study of deceit of the gravest nature. Simply put, Taoiseach, this is a national scandal. It is a national scandal enabled by a toxic culture within the HSE. Notwithstanding any inquiry, if we are to ensure that this does not happen again there must be accountability and wide-ranging change in the HSE and this needs to start at the top. Notwithstanding the fact that we do not as of yet have not only all of the information but some of the most basic information that one might expect, we know that Tony O'Brien has presided over negligence, concealment and misinformation, with the most serious consequences for women and their families and so he cannot remain on as director general of the HSE. This is the very least that women affected and their families need to see happening.  Let us be clear. This was not a communications mess-up or, as Mr. O'Brien put it, a failure to close a communications loop. This was a deliberate and devastating concealment of vital information to protect the management of the HSE and, ultimately, the State in court. Women had a medical test read incorrectly. This information was known to the HSE yet these women were kept in the dark for years, deliberately. This organisational mindset does not develop by accident; it is the product of toxic leadership. In any other walk of life, the person ultimately responsible for any such scandal would lose his or her job.  The Taoiseach is the boss and the buck stops with him. I put it to the Taoiseach, as I did yesterday, that he must remove Tony O'Brien from his post.

Nonetheless, we need to restore confidence in cancer screening in Ireland and in CervicalCheck. As a result of this, there will be a statutory inquiry. We are inviting the spokespeople to meet this evening following the committee hearing this afternoon to discuss what form that inquiry will take. The inquiry will be able to establish whether the allegations Deputy McDonald makes are true, as is the purpose of any inquiry. One needs to have an inquiry before one can make findings of fact, in my opinion and, I hope, in the opinion of most people in this House. The clinical director of CervicalCheck has already stepped down and the director, the official who runs CervicalCheck, is no longer in charge. Damien McCallion has replaced him. This means we already have individual accountability, at least, on two accounts.Mr. O'Brien's term as director general of the HSE ends in 12 weeks' time and we are in the process of finding a replacement. We have also indicated that we will re-establish a board for the HSE to enhance accountability. I am aware that this is an enormously difficult issue and that people are very worried about it, but we need to make sure we do not lose sight of a wider truth. Cancer care in Ireland has improved dramatically in recent years. We have better diagnoses, better treatment and better prevention. Screening does work. The incidence of cervical cancer has gone down from 14 per 100,000 in 2011 to ten per 100,000, a very significant reduction. It is about 7% per year of the number of cases of cervical cancer. Because of CervicalCheck, women are going for smear tests and screening and some 50,000 abnormalities have been identified. That is 50,000 women for whom we have been able to prevent cervical cancer or ensure they received earlier treatment and had a better outcome. It is 50,000 women whose lives, potentially, have been saved and whose treatment was instituted earlier because of CervicalCheck. We should not forget that figure. It is 50,000 women who have benefited from the programme. The biggest travesty of all would be if women were to stop going for smear tests. It is important that we get that message out to the general public.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	As a woman, there is absolutely no chance of me not going for a cervical smear test. I believe this reflects the view of the majority of women who are very well versed in the necessity to care for their health and the efficacy and value of screening. The Taoiseach should not repeat that again to avoid answering the questions that have been put. He said it might have been a cock-up. That might be his view, but it was some cock-up that left women without information to which they were entitled, information that affected their lives and the medical treatment they might seek. It was subsequently kept from families when women deceased. We know of 17 women so far, but I dare say there were more. It is quite a cock-up. The withholding of the information was not accidental. It was clearly the policy and the strategy of the HSE to keep it from women and their families. How do we know this? We know it because Vicky Phelan and her legal representatives painstakingly and painfully established the facts in her case via the courts. She is not on her own and not unique. Mr. Tony O'Brien's contract finishes in a couple of weeks. I put it to the Taoiseach as head of the Government that it is a scandal that Mr. O'Brien will be left in his post for those weeks to sail off into the sunset with a large pension and a hefty gratuity, leaving a scene of devastation, upset and trauma behind him. If the Taoiseach is serious about providing leadership on this matter and reassuring women across the State, he would do the first thing that needs to happen - to remove that incompetent man from the position he holds.

I really hope Deputy Mary Lou McDonald is correct and that this figure will not go down. I am, however, concerned that it will and that lives may be lost as a result. It is important that we get across the message again and again that cervical screening saves lives. In the past ten years there were some 50,000 anomalies identified. I will not be told to stop saying that; I will keep saying it because I care about women's health and women's lives. A lot of allegations have been made and they need to be investigated. I can guarantee that there will be a statutory inquiry to investigate whether the allegations being made are true. This is not just about targeting individuals or looking for heads to roll. I have mentioned that there has already been a resignation of one person who is no longer in their position. This is not about targeting one head, another head and then another. It is about the women who have been affected and their health. That is why the first and most important thing we are doing is getting a team of expert cytopathologists, led by the Royal College of Obstetricians, to look again at all of the smear tests of all of the women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer in the past ten years. This clinical review will be carried out and done by the end of May.

I am happy that the Government is not going down the route of a HIQA report which was rushed into, although it was inappropriate. We do not have the facts before us. Many comments have been made on tribunals, what they cost and how they can go on. What is ignored is that tribunals come about because we do not have the facts before us in the Dáil, Members are not allowed to ask questions and when we do, we do not receive replies. I suggest the Taoiseach come back with a comprehensive report on the knowledge that he, his Minister and the Department has. We can then discuss that information in the Dáil, with a view to deciding on what is the appropriate form of inquiry. The Taoiseach mentioned the Grace case as an a example of how long an inquiry could take. The delay was due completely to the previous Government. It was decided in February 2016 to have an inquiry, but it took until last year to set it up and a little longer again because the Government did not give the senior counsel an office from which to work. The Taoiseach referred to Galway and HIQA. That is not what established the facts in Galway but an independent review with an independent chairperson from London who carried out a very effective inquiry. I say all of this in coming to the health board and the case of three children who were raped systematically. It was exposed on the "Prime Time" programme almost two weeks ago and has been raised by the leader of Sinn Féin and the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on health. It is concerning that we have the facts about these three women. The Taoiseach gave an answer in the Dáil and waffled on about something as serious as an independent inquiry. There will be an independent investigation. He then went on to say there was an investigation, that it had been established in April 2016 and that he hoped it would be completed by the end of this year. However, he did not have the terms of reference and knew nothing about it. The first girl made a disclosure in 2009, the second in 2011 and the third in 2013, yet the Taoiseach came into the Dáil and waffled about an independent review that would be set up or had been set up. In April 2016 the referral was made to the independent review panel. There was no explanation for how it had taken until April 2016 to be referred. There was no explanation of the terms of reference and no commitment to learn anything from the case, except empty reassurances such as the ones the Taoiseach has given to the people on cervical smear tests. He is not in a position to give reassurance, but he is in a position to give us the facts. Will he explain to the House why it took until April 2016 to refer the matter to the independent review panel? Who made the decision? Why had there been no inquiry at that point? The first girl came forward to disclose in 2009. We are now in 2018, but we have no answers for her. Before coming to the Chamber today, I took the trouble to re-read the Official Report and listen to the programme. The girl has asked what was the point of her coming out and saying what she said. Perhaps the Taoiseach might answer her today. All I want from the Government is for it to state it does not know, that it will make inquiries and that it will then come and tell us. The Dáil could then make a decision.

It is the intention of the Minister for Health after the hearings this afternoon to call together the health spokespersons for the main parties to discuss with them the appropriate form of inquiry that should take place with reference to CervicalCheck. On the other concern raised by the Deputy, the information I have is that the independent review panel is investigating the matters mentioned. It has not yet reported.The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is the line Minister. I will ask her to make contact with the Deputy and give her any information that she may seek.

The Taoiseach is in charge. What knowledge does the Taoiseach have about the delay from when the first girl disclosed, the second girl in 2011, the third girl in 2013, to April 2016, when a referral was made to an independent review panel? What investigation has the Taoiseach done? What has his Department said to him? What has the head of the Health Service Executive, Mr. O'Brien, said? When was it set up? How was this the choice relating to the systematic rape of three young girls under the watch of the Health Service Executive? The Taoiseach came in and reassured us, when he is not in a position to reassure us. The committee that looked at foster care in Ireland raised serious concerns about the absence of comprehensive data. There is no way the Taoiseach can reassure us. What is the number of children in Ireland without an allocated social worker? What knowledge does the Taoiseach have of the delay? What did the Health Service Executive do internally when it discovered the systematic rape of three young children? What decisions were made? Who accounted to whom? Perhaps we would not need inquiries if the Taoiseach simply found out information and brought it to us so that we could learn, improve and give reassurance at that point.

My understanding is that these matters relating to the regulation of foster care and child protection were assigned to Tusla from the HSE in 2014, if not before that. This is a matter that falls to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. My Department does not have direct involvement in it but I will mention to the Minister that Deputy Connolly has raised this matter again. I will ask the Minister to contact Deputy Connolly and provide any information that she can.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	Earlier this year, the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, was presented with a briefing note on the HSE's spending on legal services and its open disclosure policy. We were also told that a contingent liability of €2 billion is needed by the HSE to fund claims into the future. The briefing note goes on to say that international evidence has demonstrated that patients are often forced down the legal route to get answers, acknowledgement and apologies when things go wrong with their care. Here we are, ten years on, and a woman in the worst of circumstances has been dragged through the courts to get answers. Indeed, had Vicky Phelan not been so brave to do what she did, then none of us would be any the wiser. Even if open disclosure is in place and these issues are mediated, what assurances are there that the identified failures will be remedied for others in the future? It takes people going public and not signing confidentiality agreements to force this into the public domain. How many other scandals have fallen under the radar because someone has agreed to a confidentiality clause? At what point do these repeated failings lead to system reform? The State Claims Agency alone has the legal authority to determine the management of claims made against the HSE. On the RTÉ news last night, the State Claims Agency said that in the case of medical negligence, the agency's policy is to admit liability. That is a direct contradiction to the statement of Caoimhe Haughey of C.M. Haughey Solicitors on the same programme, who said that, in her experience, the State Claims Agency robustly defends every case and shows little or no compassion. Her comments are played out week after week when we see the HSE apologise after a settlement is made in the courts for medical negligence. There is a litany of cases we could point to, including the one to which Deputy Connolly has drawn attention. Last week, we had the "Prime Time" programme relating to child and youth mental health services and the failures there. Do we have to continuously have high profile failures or force people to lay themselves and their personal stories bare in the media or courtroom for our systems to be overhauled? The Taoiseach was Minister for Health when the proposed legislation to make open disclosure mandatory was rejected. He made a decision to establish a patient safety office within his Department rather than the impartial office which leading health experts said was required. Does the Taoiseach accept that, in doing so, he removed any hope of true impartiality within that office and by failing to heed the World Health Organization's advice to implement mandatory open disclosure? His actions in 2014 have directly contributed to the current scandal. At the time, his now Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, said that in failing to legislate for mandatory open disclosure, all the Taoiseach was doing was maintaining a lawyer's slush fund. He also described the Taoiseach's comments as absolute nonsense. Does the Taoiseach accept that he was right?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	135	Nobody in the Government, whether me personally, or anybody in this House, wants to see sick or terminally ill people dragged through the courts. Nobody wants to see prolonged legal cases going on for years. The public does not want that either. It is not in anyone's interest. It is not in the interest of taxpayers in the long run. It is not in the interest of the health service when it comes to confidence in the health service, and it is not in the interests of patients or citizens. I have looked into this and am told by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the State Claims Agency that 98% of medical negligence cases are settled or dropped and do not go to trial. Only about 2% go to a contested court hearing and those 2% often go to court because facts or claims are contested. There will always be a certain percentage where the facts or claims are contested. In Vicky Phelan's case, as the Deputy knows, the case against the HSE was struck out but the laboratory settled for €2.5 million without accepting liability. While there may not have been legal liability on the State, I think there was moral liability on the State to ensure that she got the information about the case that she should have got. There was a breach of duty to ensure that occurred. How will we deal with these matters? The first thing is to ensure that more cases do not go to court at all. We can do that by building a culture of truth in our health service. That means open disclosure and many other things. Bear in mind that this is the Government that legislated for open disclosure in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017. That will be commenced before June this year. We will also legislate, as we indicated last year and in the programme for Government in 2016, for mandatory open disclosure in the most serious incidents, which are those that are considered to be serious reportable incidents. We need to reform our laws to make sure that legal cases proceed more quickly. Let us not forget that the legal profession can help with this too. Where something goes legal, there are two sides, and both sides need to work together to make sure that cases are not prolonged. We can do that in a number of ways. For example, pre-action protocols, periodic payment orders and mediation have been legislated for by this Government. In the past year or two there have been three major Acts, designed to do exactly what the Deputy says should be done, namely, the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, Legal Services Regulation Act and Mediation Act, which were passed in the last few months. I saw an example described yesterday in the news of a case which was handled very differently, that is, the case of a young boy who had a birth injury who settled for €5 million. That was done by mediation. The sister described on "Six One News" last night how things can be and often are done differently. On that patient safety office, I was the Minister for Health who set it up. There was not one before. When one does things, one needs to do them in a stepwise manner. It is not possible to make all reforms happen overnight but we are making those reforms happen.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	When the Taoiseach says that 98% of claims are not pursued through the courts, there are many different things that can happen. People can be afraid of the might of the State and the consequences for themselves. We know that settlements are routinely made on the steps of the court. We do not know what gagging orders or confidentiality agreements hide some of what we see.There seems to be a conflict between the approach of the State Claims Agency and that of the HSE. That conflict must be resolved because if it is not, we will continue to see cases going through the courts. The Taoiseach set up a voluntary as opposed to a mandatory arrangement, which is not yet in force. Does he regret not setting it up as a mandatory arrangement? He said that he has set up an office within his Department, rather than the independent office recommended by health experts. Why did he do that? Why was his approach the better of the two approaches? What information did he have that it would produce a better result?

Open disclosure has been policy for all HSE staff since 2013 and staff can be disciplined for not following open disclosure. The decision we made - it is in the programme for Government in black and white - is to proceed with voluntary open disclosure for all errors and mandatory open disclosure for those most serious errors, what are called serious reportable errors. That is also explained. The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act supports voluntary open disclosure and puts it on a statutory footing. We enacted that in this Dáil in the past couple of months. I, as Taoiseach, led the Government that did that. People have been talking about that for ten or 20 years but this Government got it done.

We need to create a culture of truth in the health service where people operate in that space. The next step is to legislate for mandatory open disclosure of serious reportable incidents. We indicated we would do that at the time. But it is a mistake if people believe it is as simple as passing a law.

I was very taken aback by the Taoiseach's response to my earlier question regarding the potential conflict of interest involved in the director general of the HSE being on the board of Evofem, a contraceptive manufacturer in the United States. Thomas Lynch, the chair of the Mater Hospital, is also chair of that company. Does the Taoiseach not get the potential conflict of interest? I do not know how Mr. O'Brien was facilitated in going on that board. Mr. Lynch is chair of the Mater Hospital and the Ireland East Hospital Group and will be putting forward projects which the Mater Hospital will want. I do not know how the director general of the HSE got on the board.

I do not understand why the Taoiseach does not get that. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, made a grave error in facilitating Mr. O'Brien joining that board. I have no personal issue with Mr. O'Brien but the bottom line is that if one holds the most senior position in the Irish health service, that is the person's position. If a person wants to do something else, the person should resign or retire and do something else but not do both. There is a real potential conflict of interest given the huge competition for resources between hospitals in Dublin, of which the Taoiseach is as aware as I am. A clear conflict of interest is staring the Taoiseach in the face.

I understand the audit formed the basis of a report presented yesterday evening to Tony O'Brien, who is still director general of the HSE. Given the level of confusion and misinformation that has marked this sorry episode, the report should be made available to Members. I also want again to register my huge anger and bemusement that far from Mr. O'Brien being dealt with and removed from his post, not alone will he go off with his pension and a gratuity but he is being facilitated in the way previously described to participate on a board and receive fees for that in a manner that is a clear conflict of interest. That offers an interesting perspective on the Taoiseach's style of government and his attitude as head of Government, not least to the women of this country.

I seek clarity on a statement made this morning by the Taoiseach. Myriad questions on this issue will have to be asked and answered in the coming days. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, yesterday stated that the HSE is to introduce a new screening test from October. The current cytology test used by CervicalCheck has a low sensitivity of between 60% and 75% and, as a consequence, produces a not insignificant number of false negative results. It is to be replaced by a new HPV test which produces more accurate results. According to the documents published yesterday, the new test tests for HPV which is responsible for 70% of cervical cancers. Are we moving from a less accurate universal test which produces up to 30% false negatives to a more accurate test which is ineffective for 30% of cervical cancers?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	I am somewhat out of date when it comes to medicine.

I have not had a chance to read that yet. I would invite the Deputy to examine the HIQA HTA on that which would explain all these issues.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	168	The Taoiseach promised the women of Ireland that they can be retested by their general practitioner, GP. That is very welcome because cervical testing and screening is very important. However, questions arise. In my office alone there are three women who cannot get appointments with their doctors. There is a crisis with GP services. One woman can get an appointment at the end of May. The other two women were told the GP was not taking appointments. In areas like Cavan-Monaghan, it is impossible to get an appointment with a GP. First, can the Taoiseach address how that will happen for the tens of thousands of women who are very worried now? Second, who is doing the testing? Will it be the same outsourced companies that failed Vicky Phelan and probably tens of thousands of other women? When we get to the truth of this issue and get past the tip of the iceberg, I reckon we will find that thousands of women have been failed. Will the same outsourced companies do the testing or has the Taoiseach made alternative arrangements?

Two US laboratories are used - one in New Jersey and one in Texas - and one laboratory is used in the Coombe hospital, not too far from here. The Health Service Executive audit that was done does not show any statistically significant difference in terms of the number of false negatives or false positives between the different laboratories. That is something we will have to examine. I have heard what people have said. I have heard the people talking on the radio who have raised concerns about the US laboratories but the information we have, and in the interests of women's health we should base our decisions on fact, is that they do not show a statistically significant difference in false negatives in one laboratory from the other. Until we have evidence to the contrary, we need to base our decisions on those facts.

This is where I have an issue with the Minister, Deputy Harris, and Mr. Tony O'Brien. That is only one of the terrible things going on with the HSE. A 14 year old girl has been languishing for the past ten weeks in a paediatric ward in Clonmel hospital. Is the Taoiseach going to continue to save Mr. O'Brien and the Minister, Deputy Harris? In terms of the paragraph the Taoiseach read out earlier, the Minister, Deputy Harris, is nothing but a puppet for the HSE. He signed off on that letter to allow this man go off to an American company. He is already on a salary from the HSE of €192,000 a year. I want the Taoiseach, in the interests of the women and children of Ireland, and the mental health of the people of Ireland, to immediately dispose of the services of the Minister and Mr. O'Brien. It must be remembered that Mr. O'Brien had a track record of deceit with the Irish Family Planning Association and what he did there before he ever came into the HSE. There was no investigation of that, and the Taoiseach was the Minister for Health at that time. Both of them have to go, not one or the other but the two of them in unison. If the Taoiseach has a shred of credibility or respect for the women and children in this country, the Minister and Mr. O'Brien have to be sacked.

What is the Taoiseach's relationship with Mr. Thomas Lynch? Is it the case that he hosted a fundraising event for the Taoiseach last year?

The tenant purchase scheme was a vital part of housing in all local authorities. For a number of years we did not have a tenant purchase scheme. In the past three years, a new tenant purchase scheme was introduced but only 80% of applicants are qualifying for the scheme. Pensioners have savings, and have spent years in their houses, yet they do not qualify for the scheme that will allow them purchase their house. I want the Minister to do something about that. I have a question about another aspect of housing. The Minister said he would provide funding for emergency housing, namely, demountable homes, in our local authority area. I hear from people every day that the Department is refusing, delaying and not providing money for this vital housing need. The people who are seeking demountable homes have the space to put them in place. People in Dublin are buying expensive sites and so on but the people in our county have the space to erect a demountable home. I have been told that the Department is not allocating funding to our local authority to buy these demountable homes.

The tenant purchase scheme is currently under review and that review will conclude in the coming months. On funding for what one might call a demountable or modular home or rapid build, funding is available from the Department for every county council. If the Deputy has a specific site or case about which he is concerned, I ask him to bring it to my attention and I will raise it with the council directly.

Banks, such as AIB and Permanent TSB, are announcing the potential sale of loans to vulture funds. That could potentially result in householders, farmers and business people losing their property. As the Government is the main shareholder in AIB, will it stop the sale of loans or mortgages to vulture funds by AIB?

#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	I want to ask the Taoiseach about the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, which was referred to the select committee over seven months ago.This Bill needs to be amended to include protections for members of defined benefit pension schemes whose employers attempt to wind down such schemes and walk away from their pension obligations. A recent example of this involves Irish Life whose defined benefit pension scheme not only meets the funding standards but has a surplus of €240 million. When will the Government step up and stop employers winding down defined benefit schemes for no reason other than transferring the risk from their books onto their employees? We need to stop employers and big businesses from walking away from their pension obligations to their workers.

I must acknowledge the changes which the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has introduced at the IDA resulting in a new focus by that agency on the Border region. As the Taoiseach is aware, I have pointed out on numerous occasions in the House that the north west is the worst performing region in terms of jobs growth. Can we expect this new focus at the IDA to continue and can we expect more job announcements in the north west in the future?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	I was pleased yesterday to see that unemployment has fallen below 6% and now stands at 5.9% for the first time in more than ten years. In County Leitrim the live register figures have fallen from 3,640 in 2011 to 1,965 now, and in Sligo they have fallen from 5,543 to 3,302 now. We are seeing a very significant fall in unemployment in both counties, and if one takes the Border counties as a whole, unemployment is now below the national average. I acknowledge, however, that there has been slow progress in securing employment growth and IDA-based jobs in particular in Sligo. It is very much part of the focus of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to make sure that as many IDA and Enterprise Ireland supported jobs as possible are created outside of the Dublin area and she has made some great progress in that regard. The majority of new jobs supported by both agencies are being created outside of Dublin now. We need to continue in that vein and the Minister will do so to ensure that we have employment growth and good jobs in Sligo.

Almost two and a half years later and despite that commitment, Drogheda, which is the largest town in Ireland, has only one full-time and one part-time occupational therapist to cater for the entire town and the surrounding areas of south Louth. There are 124 people on the waiting list at the moment and the estimated waiting time is 44 weeks. An old age pensioner with Parkinson's disease has been told that he will have to wait 44 weeks to be assessed by an occupational therapist. When is the Minister for Health or the Taoiseach going to take HSE senior management to task over this? This is a serious failure. How can the Taoiseach justify this substandard delivery of health care in his so-called Ireland of equals, or rather of opportunity.

In that vein, I ask the Taoiseach to give a commitment to the House that all relevant documentation relating to CervicalCheck will be published on the Department of Health's website in advance of any inquiry, because once an inquiry begins, it may be difficult to get documentation. I refer in this instance to publishing emails, correspondence between the Department of Health and CervicalCheck and between the Department of Health and the HSE, and all other relevant documentation in the interests of the transparency of which the Taoiseach is allegedly so fond.

The minute a statutory inquiry is established, all of these FOI requests will be denied. Depending on the type of inquiry that is set up, it may be months if not years before we get to the truth. In the era of transparency and given what was done by the Department of Finance in the past in terms of publishing all of the documentation relating to NAMA on its own website before providing same to a committee of the Assembly, will the Taoiseach ensure that the Department of Health, the HSE and other agencies publish all necessary information, in a redacted format with no personal information, so that the public can have full sight of what went on behind the scenes in this area?

Heretofore a payment known as "country money" was paid to construction workers, including bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, welders and so on, who had to travel and stay away from home for at least four nights per week. The payment rate is currently set at €181.68 per week. The last time this allowance was increased was on 1 July 2008, even though it was to be increased every six months and in line with increases in the consumer price index. Will the Taoiseach consult the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on this and urge her to bring together the relevant trade unions and the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, to look at this because it is causing a lot of hardship for those who have to travel to work and stay away from home for several nights? In the context of the rising cost of accommodation, this allowance needs to be looked at again.

That is creating challenges within the construction sector as it tries to supply the necessary workers. The Government has recently set up a construction sector working group and that is the best forum in which to deal with the issue raised by the Deputy. As he knows, what employers in the private sector pay their own employees is a matter for them, although it is an area in which both the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission have been involved. The construction sector working group includes representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and a number of Departments and is the best forum in which to analyse the matter raised by the Deputy.

If that 5% that has been proposed by the European Commission is added to an average of 3% inflation over those seven years, that could amount to a cut to CAP of 26% by the year 2027. That is what farmers could be facing, and considering that many sheep and beef farmers in this country depend exclusively on CAP payments for their net income, such a situation cannot be tolerated.Following on from this morning's announcement, I ask the Taoiseach to set out his plans for working with other European leaders to ensure the budget is not cut and the incomes of farm families are protected over the coming years.

We have given our very strong view that CAP and other well-functioning programmes like Erasmus and Horizon should not be cut. Our negotiating position will be that there should be no cut in CAP payments to farmers. We have indicated that this country is willing to increase its contribution to the EU budget to protect these well-funded programmes, as long as other countries are willing to do likewise. We will work with our allies across the Union to achieve that.

I would like to focus on the issue of protected geographical indication. Every whiskey that is produced on the island of Ireland is designated as "Irish whiskey". After Brexit, it will no longer be possible to call Bushmills "Irish whiskey". This will have an impact on all the other products that are called "Irish whiskey". The system of protected geographical indication is governed by an EU directive. When the UK leaves the EU, all the products in Ireland that come under that directive will be affected because it will no longer be the case that the entire island is in the EU. The Government needs to focus on this issue, which will have a particular impact on the spirits industry. We need to be conscious of the need to protect this huge growth industry.

I repeat the call that was made in the motion that was agreed by the House for the Minister to meet the unions as a matter of urgency so that strike action can be averted. Approximately 40 of the 1,200 community employment supervisors in this country are due to retire this year. This matter has been well discussed in the Dáil. The last thing we want is for these supervisors to take strike action because that would mean the 25,000 workers on the scheme would not have anyone to manage them. I appeal to the Minister to meet them as a matter of urgency.

We have a difficulty with this matter for the same reasons that applied to Deputy Butler's party in government when this ruling was made. It was outlined in the Dáil last week that it would cost €180 million to deal with everybody who could be affected by what is proposed. When this is taken with the knock-on costs across the entire State of dealing with those who provide the service on behalf of the State but do not work for the State, it is clear that the overall cost would be gigantic. I am open to any ideas or engagement regarding how we can deal with this matter without creating a huge contingent cost and difficulty for this and any future Government.

#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	240	According to the programme for Government, which contains a number of references to "A Just and Fair Society", the Government wants "people to have the peace of mind that comes from feeling safe and secure". When the people of County Roscommon, and particularly the Ballaghaderreen area, welcomed some unfortunate people from Syria, they were promised the sun, the moon and the stars in return for making them welcome. According to a recent report on Shannonside FM, people at the emergency reception and orientation centre in Ballaghaderreen have said it is like a prison. Individuals who have been through some very tough times have been at the centre for six to nine months, but the promised housing has not come. While they are at pains to point out that they thank the Irish people for taking them in and giving them a better quality of life, they are in a desperate state. Will the Taoiseach go back to his Ministers to try to sort this out and give some quality of life to the many families that are cooped up together in a small area?

#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 to give students living in student specific accommodation under license the full protections of the Residential Tenancies Acts, including access to the Residential Tenancies Board and inclusion in the rent pressure zones.As most Deputies know, there has been a crisis in student accommodation across the State for many years. The Government has estimated that approximately 25,000 additional student-specific accommodation units are needed. There has been increased investment, especially from international investors, in recent years. Approximately 40 student-specific accommodation projects have been completed recently or are under way. Approximately €400 million is being invested in these projects which will provide approximately 5,000 student beds. While any investment in increased student accommodation is welcome, the rent increases being encountered by students are not. It is increasingly the case that the rents being charged in student-specific accommodation are substantially out of the reach of students and families with modest or low incomes. This was highlighted recently by the significant controversy at Shanowen Square and Shanowen Hall near DCU, where rents are set to increase by between 20% and 27% from the last academic year to the next academic year. That means students will have between €8,300 and €8,700 in rent over the course of the academic year, which equates to a monthly rent of between €925 and €966. Rents in Shanowen Hall have increased by over 100% since 2014. I commend the students of DCU on the Shanowen shakedown protest, which brought this matter to the attention of the public. The problem of excessive rents is not confined to that part of the city. Indeed, student campus accommodation in UCD can cost between €700 and €1,000 a month for nine months of the year. Most Deputies on all sides of the Chamber have been asking who can afford such rents. The answer is very simple. Only students from very wealthy families or from overseas can afford them. The maximum SUSI maintenance grant for an individual is between €3,000 and €5,000, which means students from low-income or modest-income families are increasingly unable to cover their rent from their grants, let alone look after other areas of their student lives. The simple Bill before the House seeks to amend the definition of "a tenancy" in the Residential Tenancies Acts to include student licences. Having spoken to officials in the Residential Tenancies Board, I understand the board is not sure whether student licences are covered under the Residential Tenancies Acts. The board is encouraging students to take a case to it to ascertain whether such licences are covered. Regardless of whether that transpires, there is a strong case for providing legal clarity by amending the relevant Acts. Deputy Funchion and I are introducing this Bill for that reason. The Bill proposes to include student licences under the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts, thereby ensuring properties in the affected areas are covered by the rent pressure zones and giving those living in student properties access to the Residential Tenancies Board for the resolution of disputes relating to deposits and maintenance, etc.It would give them a level of protection they do not have. There has been widespread political support from Deputies of all parties for the student protests in Dublin City University and a measure such as this which is very simple and straightforward should receive unanimous support across the House. It is our intention in Sinn Féin to bring forward this Bill in Private Members' time at an early opportunity to try to give students the protections they rightly deserve in advance of the next academic year. I have introduced the legislation on First Stage and it is our intention to bring it forward on Second Stage. I ask all Members of the House and, in particular, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to give the matter serious consideration. If the wording of our Bill is not appropriate, I ask him to work with us to amend it to ensure students do not face rent increases of 27% or more, whether in DCU or elsewhere across the State.

A number of coroner cases have addressed the absence of safety features on quad bikes that are now used by more than just the agricultural community. The Bill seeks to introduce a number of measures. The first is that those who use quad vehicles would have to use headgear. The Bill would also introduce roll bars in order to give people maximum protection. It would benefit from a very good discussion at the pre-legislative stage in order to enhance it and ensure we address the wide range of matters surrounding farm safety and the use of machinery on farms.

Media mergers are regulatory issues to be dealt with by the appropriate regulatory authority which, in the first instance, is the Consumer and Competition Protection Commission, CCPC. Should the commission clear the transaction to proceed, it is then referred to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to conduct an initial assessment of the likely impact of the transaction on plurality in the media in the State. Following that assessment, the Minister has the option of allowing the transaction to proceed, allowing it to proceed with conditions or referring it to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, for a phase 2 or full merger examination. In the cases referred for a phase 2 examination, the BAI must make a recommendation on whether the merger should be allowed to proceed, proceed with conditions or not to be allowed to proceed. The Minister must then make a final decision on whether the merger should be allowed to proceed, proceed with conditions or not to be allowed to proceed. The purpose of the media mergers regime is to safeguard the diversity and pluralism of media in the State and foster regulatory environments that will enable media companies to flourish, as well as to ensure a range of diverse views are heard. These policy matters are for the Minister and questions should be directed to him in the first instance. Any issue arising that would require a Government decision would be dealt with by the Government as a whole rather than a Cabinet committee.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	259	After many days of controversy, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, finally got around to admitting he should not have spoken to a lobbyist for a media company, Independent News & Media, INM, about a media merger it was promoting. He still claims that he did nothing wrong but admits that he should not have done it and said he would not do it again. The Taoiseach has agreed with the analysis that a Minister outlining how he intends to handle a referral to a lobbyist breaks no rules, even where the company concerned views the information as significant and commercially sensitive. Is he happy that this is supposedly within the rules? Will he tell us if he intends to change the rules in order that in any future case there would be a clear sanction to prevent behaviour such as this? Has the Government approached the Stock Exchange, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Competition Authority or any other official body to ask if they agree that the information provided by the Minister was not commercially sensitive? This entire affair highlights the fact that there is effectively no national policy on media diversity or media viability, which is just as important. Many organisations representing people working in the sector, as well as the companies, have spent much of recent years calling for a strategy to ensure a professional Irish media sector can survive in the era of the low-cost aggregators and unedited sites. Are we likely to see a response soon to any of these demands? I put it to the Taoiseach that a strategic Cabinet approach to media diversity and viability is called for. Given the most recent revelations, it is something the Government will have to consider very seriously.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	It is important to return to the conduct of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, with reference to the proposed takeover of Celtic Media by Independent News & Media. The Minister has yet to give a credible answer or explanation for his conduct in providing what could be fairly regarded as confidential information for a lobbyist acting on behalf of INM, an interested party in a media merger. The Taoiseach might like to take the opportunity to offer an explanation for that conduct. During his statement on the matter in the Dáil on 18 April the Minister confirmed that in November 2016 he had spoken to Mr. Eoghan Ó Neachtain who, as we know, was acting on behalf of INM. More importantly, the Minister knew this at the time. He stated that in the conversation with Mr. Ó Neachtain he had expressed a purely personal view that the likely course of action would be a referral for a phase 2 assessment in accordance with the guidelines on diversity and media plurality. The statement directly contradicts what the Minister told the Dáil on 6 December 2016 in response to a question from my colleague, Teachta Brian Stanley. It is now clear that the Minister misled the Dáil on his likely action on the proposed takeover. The Minister was not merely a well informed observer in this process. He was not in a position to provide a purely personal view. He was the Minister with statutory responsibility for the process and it is clear he provided confidential information for one party in that process. Has the Taoiseach raised the matter with the Minister subsequent to the events of the week before last? Has he urged the Minister to provide a clarifying statement and an apology for the Dáil? There should be a correction of the Official Report of the Dáil.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	261	There are many issues arising from the recent controversy surrounding INM, including the lobbying of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and the data breach involving journalists' and barristers' emails. Another issue which to my mind is the most important is the lack of media plurality in this country.The hallmark of any meaningful democracy is genuine freedom of the press and media and that it is not dominated by one or a small number of individuals. In this country, however, Mr. Denis O'Brien - one of the richest men in this country - dominates or outright owns the Irish Independent, the Sunday Independent, the Sunday World, the Evening Herald, 50% of the Daily Star, a host of local newspapers, Today FM, Newstalk, Dublin's 98FM, Spin 103, Spin Southwest and we can carry on through the list. This is outrageous. It is particularly so in the light of the allegations made. I was reading back over emails from Mr. Gavin O'Reilly back in 2010 where he was rebutting requests from Mr. Leslie Buckley, Mr. Denis O'Brien's representative on the board. He was asking that Mr. Sam Smyth be moved off his coverage of the Tribunal of Inquiry into certain Payments to Politicians and Related Matters. That was direct interference in the freedom of journalists to write. Mr. Smyth subsequently lost his job. To add to that, Mr. O'Brien is a tax refugee. Then the Taoiseach has private meetings with this guy in Davos. It is extraordinary. Is the Taoiseach concerned about the monopoly of one individual over the Irish media and does he have any desire to do, or intention of doing, anything about that? The Taoiseach says it is the BAI and it is this, that and the other. In the end, as he said, it is the Government, the Cabinet or the Minister. It is a political decision. Are we going to do something about this? If we are not, we cannot talk in a meaningful way about press freedom, plurality and diversity in this country.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	262	Deputy Boyd Barrett makes a strong point. We need to face up to the requirement for plurality in the media so that there is more than one control mechanism for the media people access in this country. Over the weekend, I read speculation that the Taoiseach was talking about legislation in this area. Is the Government concerned at the increased concentration of media ownership in Ireland? Should an independent commission be established to pull together all the strands of views on that and to address that in a very open way to ensure there are not the type of constraints referenced on any journalist. I refer to them acting freely, fairly and openly in our society. It is an important bulwark in any society. On the issues surrounding the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, I am not going to revisit them except to say that I can half understand a Minister getting a phone call and not instantly realising he should not be taking the call and stopping it but not recognising that was wrong.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	That is the point.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	That is a point not only for the Minister, Deputy Naughten, but for the Taoiseach. If the Minister had said he was caught off guard, he was thinking of other things, he should never have taken the call, the caller got through directly, he should never have imparted any information. It should never happen again and that acknowledgment would be really important. I invite the Taoiseach to make that acknowledgement today. In my own time in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, when we were dealing with public private partnerships, PPPs, I established a protocol that was published on the departmental website - it is still there - that said if a person has an interest in a PPP then he or she could not contact the Minister or any of his or her political staff directly. There is a published conduit for a person to put in a submission, query anything or provide data to the Department. It is completely wrong that it would be done in a covert way. It was not in the public domain and it was information that was subsequently withheld from the Dáil. Will the Taoiseach acknowledge this was something that should not have happened? Are there protocols to deal with this matter in future?

The Minister, Deputy Naughten, has made his position clear on a number of occasions. I have said I am satisfied with the explanations he has given. He has apologised already and that is on the record of the Dáil. He has also said that he would not take such calls in the future. He has acknowledged that. It is important to point out that he did not do any favours for anyone. I appreciate that nobody in this House has alleged that he has done any favours for anyone but sometimes even without an allegation that impression can be created. We should all be clear in our comments that no favours were done for anyone. In fact, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, did the opposite of what I image INM would have wanted. He referred the proposed merger to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and, therefore, delayed it. It is important that we are clear in our commentary about that. He followed the advice of his officials and followed the law at all times. That is what any Minister would do and should do. He indicated in the phone call to the lobbyist that was what he would do. He would follow the advice of his officials and follow the law.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	266	That was wrong.

I have not approached the Stock Exchange or the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, about it. The ODCE acts independently. If there is a concern, I am sure if the director deems it appropriate to investigate, he will do so. Turning to media diversity, in any business competition is a good thing, whether that is a service, goods or anything else. It gives consumers more choice and reduces prices. Competition is especially important in the media. It is not a normal business. It is part of our democracy and we need to have a diversity of voices in our media. I do not think it is the role of politicians to decide what is the appropriate percentage that a media company should hold. We have the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC. The appropriate role is for it to assess any proposals for mergers and to see whether that would give any player in the market a position that is too large. I would not like to see Ministers adjudicating as to whether 27% is okay but 28% is not or to be in that space. These things should be independent of politics and politicians. They should be determined by a body such as the CCPC when it comes to a merger such as this, with the BAI having a role too. I think that system is the right one and the policy is correct as we have it. I read the Reporters Without Borders media freedom index report recently. It is interesting reading. Deputy Brendan Howlin referred to it as well. It gives us a relatively high rating in respect of media freedom. We are in the first tier but down slightly on previous years. I think we are around 13th or 14th in the world out of nearly 200 countries. However, a few things were pointed out. It pointed to what it believes is RTÉ being too large in the broadcasting space, INM being too large in the print space and our defamation laws being too much on the side of the person who was defamed. I imagine those defamed would have one view and defamers would have a different view. The issue of the protection of sources was also raised. We discussed that yesterday. I am not sure if Deputies have proposals as to how we could reduce RTÉ's position in broadcast media or INM's position in print. However, given that Reporters Without Borders put those two together, as two of the four issues it believes need to be dealt with, when we talk about this we need to talk about both issues as well. That is the analysis it put forward.  I am not sure if there has been some false reporting, but for clarity I did not have a private meeting with Mr. Denis O'Brien in Davos. No meeting was scheduled. We did not sit down together across a table or sit down together at all. He was in Davos. I was in Davos. I ran into him in a corridor. It was very public. We exchanged pleasantries and that was it.

I have not spoken to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, since his statement to the European Parliament on 18 April. As Deputies are aware, I last met formally with President Tusk in Dublin on 8 March, when we discussed a range of issues across the EU agenda, including Brexit. I thanked President Tusk for his ongoing strong support in relation to the Irish-specific issues arising from the UK's decision to leave the EU. He reiterated his commitment to ensuring that these are addressed, and that the principles and commitments agreed between the EU and the UK in the December joint report are translated into legal text in the withdrawal agreement. We also met at the EU Council in Brussels in March. The EU Council will discuss developments in the negotiations on Brexit again at its meeting in June and we will consider progress on all the outstanding withdrawal issues, including the Irish Border. As I have said previously in this House, the Government is of the strong view that we need sufficient and substantial progress by that time if the deadline of a final legal text of the withdrawal agreement before October's EU Council is to be met. The Tánaiste and I reiterated that message when we met with the European Union negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Dundalk on Monday. As was evident from Mr. Barnier's remarks, we remain resolutely united in our approach to the negotiations and we look forward to seeing the United Kingdom tabling concrete proposals on how its commitments can be delivered. This is now urgent if progress is to be made and we need to see progress made. I note an important UK Cabinet meeting is taking place today in London. I again took the opportunity to thank Mr. Barnier and his team for the great understanding, support and solidarity shown to Ireland in the negotiations and to thank him for participating in the all-island civic dialogue, visiting both parts of the island to hear at first hand the views and concerns of stakeholders.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	President Tusk has been a consistent and strong friend of Ireland since his time as Prime Minister of Poland. He has been an excellent President of the EU Council and I believe he has handled Brexit extremely well. As the final deals will be settled at summits, he will be central to what is finally agreed. In this context we need some clarity about the timing and nature of any final deal on the withdrawal text concerning Ireland. Yesterday, the Taoiseach said that a nameless someone was confused about whether the target was October or June. The one-and-only person who has caused confusion is the Taoiseach himself. At the 22 March summit the Taoiseach stated unprompted at a brief media stop that the issue could slide to October and that he would be easy about that. The Tánaiste has refused repeated requests to confirm what the Taoiseach said and he has not repeated it. Indeed, the Tánaiste has said the opposite on several occasions. It was news here at the time and throughout Europe and it has been cited by the UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, repeatedly as a justification for not showing urgency about a June deal. The Taoiseach's refusal to acknowledge his personal role and his attempt to use attack as his primary defence is noteworthy. In order to be clear, will the Taoiseach tell us exactly what he means by the need for "substantial progress" on the text by June? I asked the question again yesterday. Does this mean a mostly agreed text? Does it mean another letter from the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May? Does it mean a political declaration reaffirming what has already been affirmed? What is the minimum acceptable progress required in June to avoid the need for accelerated emergency planning for a no-deal scenario?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	We need clarity on this issue. I have tried on several occasions to nail this down in a crystal clear way, as have others. I made some comments at the Dundalk all-island dialogue, which was a really useful forum. The opportunity for open dialogue with Michel Barnier at lunch was a helpful initiative. It is a pity that unionists were not formally there. I met unionists there but they had to be there almost without declaring themselves and that is unfortunate. I realise the Taoiseach can do nothing about that. I will explain the net point I want to make. There is genuine fear now. We have all indulged in giving space to constructive ambiguity. We have certainly learned this from the Northern peace talks. Sometimes it is important to find a form of words everyone can live with sufficient unto the day as long as everyone understands where the landing point is. My fear now is that there is a degree of duplicity. We will see what comes out of the UK Cabinet meeting in London today. I do not believe there is capacity within the May Government to actually bring her Cabinet to a position that squares the fudged circle of last December. I am referring to a position where we could have a situation of no border, or no mechanisms of a border or any sign of a border on the island of Ireland and yet Ireland and Northern Ireland would be in two different customs unions and Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom would be in a single customs union. There are no legal mechanisms that I can see to do that. Asking Britain to come up with them seems a fatuous expectation now because we have had more than a year and the first effort at it by those responsible has been slapped down by the European negotiators as completely unworkable. It is important for the sake of clarity that the Taoiseach is open with the House about what he expects the point of arrival to be in July. What are the minimum terms that would be acceptable to the Taoiseach to allow discussions to go on to October? Certainly, there is no question of the Irish Border situation being folded into the post-October post-divorce discussions or into the long-term settlement discussions. This is something Michel Barnier underscored as well.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	271	This morning the hard Brexiteer wing of the Tory party told Theresa May that any proposed British customs partnership with the European Union was a non-runner. The arch-Brexiteer that is Jacob Rees-Mogg has said that any such proposal is deeply unsatisfactory and that it would not get Britain out of the EU, which is what people voted for. I agree with him on the first point. A so-called customs partnership will not resolve the issues relating to the island of Ireland. It is unworkable and unachievable and I think that is accepted by Brussels and by the Taoiseach. My view on his second point is that the people in the North of Ireland who had the opportunity to vote actually voted to remain and so they have not consented to Brexit. That was the clear and reinforced message Michel Barnier received on his visit to the North. To protect the economic and social interests of our island all of us, North and South, need to remain inside the customs union and the Single Market. As the Taoiseach knows, that is the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and citizens' rights in the North as well as to safeguard cross-Border trade. The British Government and the DUP simply have to come to terms with that reality. It is regrettable that Theresa May's Government has still not come to terms with the reality of what it agreed to in December. We should remember that. The backstop agreement, which is the bare minimum required and is of itself imperfect, was signed up to by the UK Government. I have said before that we really need clarity by June and I know others have sounded similar concerns. I have deep concern that running down the clock to October will be the strategy of the British system and Government. I believe that will leave us in a very difficult and potentially vulnerable position. Therefore, I too wish to know, come the end of June, what the Taoiseach believes must be achieved. What sufficiency does the Taoiseach envisage at that point?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	272	I asked the Taoiseach yesterday whether he and the European Union should condemn the shooting of what is now a total of 44 unarmed Palestinian protesters in Gaza in recent weeks by the Israeli forces. I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach condemned it, but really what I want to ask in the context of Europe, Donald Tusk and our role in Europe generally is whether we can move beyond the Taoiseach individually or this Parliament condemning what is going on to something actually being done about it by Europe. Europe is not some external observer to what is going on in Gaza. We give Israel favoured trade status. Israel is effectively an associate member of the European Union.A great deal of European money goes into the West Bank and Gaza and, in many cases, the products of that funding get blown to pieces or demolished by the Israelis and then we have Israel flagrantly breaking international law, killing unarmed civilians at present and they will continue to do so for the next two weeks and Europe will do nothing. Could the Taoiseach speak up about this? When he meets Donald Tusk and is engaging at the European Council could he appeal to Europe to do something about this, to put some pressure on Israel to stop killing innocent people, to stop breaking international law week in, week out and to demand that some sanctions be imposed? In any other circumstances sanctions would be imposed on people when a state kills innocent people, breaks international law or illegally occupies a territory. We would say something should be done about that but, for some reason with Israel, Europe does nothing. It just stands by and allows it to happen. Could we be a bit more forceful in demanding that Europe shows some ethical principle in terms of what Israel is doing to the Palestinians?

The deadline to conclude it is October. It always has been and that is not news. The intention is to have the text of the withdrawal agreement concluded and agreed in October after which there will be a ratification process. It will have to be ratified by the European Parliament and also by the parliament in the United Kingdom in order that it can come into legal effect before the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in March 2019, with the transition period being used to negotiate the new relationship that will exist between the UK and the EU. That will probably constitute two treaties, one treaty around security and defence and a separate treaty around the future economic and trading partnership. In October we also intend to agree a political declaration as to what we envisage the form of those two treaties should be. Those are the two things that need to be done by the Council meeting in October. The EU guidelines about June are very clear. They say that we will review the situation at the European Council meeting in June.

Ireland's position is the position of 27 member states. We negotiate as 27 from a position of strength. Our position, which is in the guidelines, is that we will review progress at the meeting in Brussels in June. We want to see real and meaningful progress by June if we are going to meet that December deadline, or rather the October deadline. There is a real risk that we will not meet the October deadline if we do not see real and meaningful progress in June. It is still early May. It is only the first week in May. There are many moving parts. There are shifting sands. An important UK cabinet meeting is under way today and parliamentary votes of significance are happening across the water now. We need to treat this as an evolving situation, and it is one. We are very far from making a decision point as to what the maximum amount of progress is that can be achieved in June. Obviously, we will make that decision at the time. Let there be no doubt that we are insisting that there has to be a backstop in the withdrawal agreement. The UK now acknowledges that there has to be a backstop in the withdrawal agreement. People call it different things. It is officially called the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. I believe I started using the term "backstop", which the EU has adopted as the term. Prime Minister May calls it the last resort. The Secretary of State, David Davis, calls it a reserve parachute. What we all agree, no matter what one calls it, is that the withdrawal agreement must have that. It must be in the withdrawal agreement and, if it is not, then there cannot be a withdrawal agreement. It is worth acknowledging some of the progress that has been made in these negotiations, step by step, during the past year or two. There was the joint report in December in which the UK commits to ensuring that there is no hard border, including physical infrastructure and associated checks. There was the commitment to retain the common travel area, which is very important for reasons that everyone in this House will know. There was the Kenny text, which allows Northern Ireland, should it decide to do so, to join the European Union through Irish unity, if that is something that the majority of people in Northern Ireland want to happen in the future. We also have the transition period, which is really important, giving business, public services and individuals until the end of 2020 to prepare for any permanent changes that may take place. I know there has been some suggestions from some parties in this House that we should have rejected those terms, that we should not have agreed to those terms of the transition agreement. I strongly refute that suggestion. Irish business, farmers and workers need that transition period to prepare for the future, to protect their businesses, farming and jobs.

We only have a foreign policy when we agree and that is done by consent and so by unanimity. For example, on the issue of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the EU is able to take a fully united position, namely, that we did not agree with the decision of the United States to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and that EU states would not be doing so. On other matters it has not been possible to find that consensus and different member states have different attitudes to issues.

Could he give us some sense of what "meaningful progress" means? It is the Tánaiste who said more strongly than anybody here that if there was no progress by June - "substantial" is the word he used - then it would be questionable whether we would have any deal at all in October. He said that during a BBC interview about two months ago. He raised the hare. It is the Taoiseach and his colleagues who came out and said they were not agreeing to anything in June until we get some progress, some deal. The Taoiseach created all of that language and momentum, so he cannot be blaming everybody else. I would like to know what "meaningful progress" means.

The question relates to my role as Taoiseach in the referendum campaign on the eight amendment of the Constitution. I have no function in the matter. My Department has no role in any campaign related to the referendum and no involvement beyond its normal role of supporting and providing a secretariat for the Government.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	The Taoiseach misunderstood the nature of the question. I will take the opportunity to make a few points in the context of it. While in international terms Ireland has highly independent and regulated elections, we are only beginning to get our act together in referendums. International experience shows that overseas attempts to interfere in votes are increasing rapidly. The work of and communication from the Referendum Commission to all citizens will be crucial as they will inform all homes objectively of what is being proposed. In this House we all accept that the issue of the eighth amendment is deeply personal and complex. Given recent polls, there is still a large number of people who are undecided and who will make up their minds in the next three weeks. I have been on doorsteps in different contexts and it is interesting that the issue is beginning to go live with people voicing more about it. Clearly, they are asking questions. The point is they are now engaging at the door, which is welcome. The debate so far has been respectful on all sides. However, in today's press it has been revealed that billboards with graphic and upsetting images have been placed outside maternity hospitals by a group which appears to be non-Irish and outside all regulatory oversight. The campaign is so extreme that it has even been attacked by a spokesperson for the part of the "No" campaign led by some of the main personalities in Youth Defence, an organisation not known for respecting boundaries in promoting its views. There is, of course, what appears to be a tidal wave of online advertising, some of which does not link with a regulated Irish organisation. Given the roles of the Referendum Commission and the Standards in Public Office Commission, will the Taoiseach consider asking them at this point to track activity which they believe might raise concerns about the origins of the funding or other efforts to avoid Irish electoral law?
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	I reiterate those concerns which have been raised with me by people on the campaign trail who are regular Facebookers and say they cannot log-on without being bombarded with what are clearly expensive advertisements advancing the "No" position. Let me say clearly that those citizens who are campaigning for a "No" vote and hold that view are absolutely entitled to hold that view and participate in the debate and campaign, but we need to have a level playing pitch. I fear, particularly in social media advertising, that rules are being broken and lines crossed. Given that the campaign is live, I wonder what we can do at this stage and what Facebook - if I can name it - can do to adequately police and ensure that level of fairness. On the graphic imagery that has appeared, particularly outside a number of maternity hospitals, I note the contrast with the removal of a mural which, for sure, was political but which in no way could have been deemed offensive, even by those who take a different political position. I am concerned that it seems no action has been taken to remove these images which - let it be said - for many women attending maternity hospitals who may have all manner of concerns and experiences have proved to be really traumatic.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	319	This is an important point. Our base law, the Constitution, is important. We have spent a great deal of time making sure that when we have a debate on changing the Constitution, it is conducted on a fair basis. We had the McKenna judgment and others that sought properly to limit the capacity of the State to influence a vote in order that there would be a level playing field to enable people to hear objectively everybody's point of view in a transparent way above everything else. There are real concerns, not only about the volume but also the unattributed nature of so much of the advertising that is bombarding social media at an incredible cost. It is targeted and often not clear. For example, there is a website, undecided8.org, which one could confuse for being an official information website of the Referendum Commission. These are improper developments. It is clearly not in the purview of the Referendum Commission, as structured, but there is now an undeniable case for the immediate establishment of a standing electoral commission. It would be too late for this referendum, but there will be other referenda. When one sees the international debate on outside influences interfering in elections, we would be foolish to think we will not be influenced by somebody, either in elections or referenda, in the future. My final comment on the disturbing imagery outside at least one maternity hospital is that yesterday I spoke to an "expectant father", if that is the proper phrase to use, who was bringing his wife into the hospital. The child is beyond the due date and when there was a little concern yesterday, they found it really disturbing to be confronted with that imagery when they were looking after the health of their child. We need to have standards in the debates we have. By and large, this debate has been conducted in a calm and civilised manner and I hope it will continue in that way, but this is over the line.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	I have been canvassing for the past four or five weeks and one learns much about what people are saying and thinking on both sides in the course of canvassing. Whatever side people are on, they are overwhelmingly shocked by how vile the imagery is. They are really upset by and very angry about it. I take some consolation from the fact that many who were considering voting "No" will now vote "Yes" because they are appalled by this stuff. Nonetheless, the vile, offensive and traumatising nature of some of the imagery is below any standard of decency, both for women who have been through abortions and people in general, and particularly for children who are sensitive about such matters. Children are asking their parents, "What is that?" It is disgusting and some measures must be taken to deal with it. A point I do not know whether the Taoiseach is prohibited from making given his original answer but which I want to make to those campaigning for a "Yes" vote that arises from my experience of canvassing was borne out in the findings of a poll that came out at the weekend. The findings of the IPSOS poll were much publicised. They indicated that 47% of people would vote "Yes" but strangely what was less publicised was the answer to another question about the percentage of people who believed the law should be changed to allow women to choose to have an abortion, if they wished to do so. The Taoiseach may be aware the figure was 62%, which is strange. A total of 47% said they would vote "Yes", while 62% believed women should have the right to choose. That suggests we need to up our game in explaining what is at stake because when one calls to a door, people ask, "Yes to what? Repeal what?" People are not clued in to political debates. When one explains the position, many say that personally they are not sure about abortion but that they think people should be allowed make their own decisions. We need to get that simple, factual explanation of what those campaigning for a "Yes" vote are campaigning for to many of the "don't knows" who are a little confused.

I absolutely agree with the Deputies and leaders on the really graphic and vile billboards and posters that we have seen pop up throughout the State. They should be removed as they are upsetting to pregnant women and their partners.I know from my own experience that a lot of children who see them have questions to ask. They do not know what they are. They do not understand them. They ask their parents about it and put their parents in a very difficult position in trying to explain what it is all about. They are counterproductive, which is the only thing I can say about them that is any way positive. I hope they will be counterproductive and that people will revolt against them and the attitudes of the kind of people who think that sort of advertising is in any way appropriate or convincing. I am very wary of overseas involvement and overseas money being part of the campaign on either side. I have full confidence in the Referendum Commission and the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, to discharge their statutory functions.

#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	The Minister is welcome and I thank him for attending. I know he makes a point of attending for Topical Issue matters and it is very much appreciated. The M50, the major ring road around Dublin carrying between 100,000 and 150,000 cars every day, is at a standstill at peak times. Accidents that happen cause complete logjams and backlogs and affect both sides of the road, feeder roads and motorway junctions, including those for the M5, the M6 and M1, and have a serious impact on the commuter belt as drivers come into Dublin. In a reply to a parliamentary question some time ago, the Minister said that congestion is estimated to cost this economy some €350 million per year and the figure is growing, not to mention the impact on people's mental and physical health of just sitting in a car or a commercial vehicle for long periods during the day, or the logjam it causes in residential areas which feed into the M50. That is the problem. However, the answer to the question as to what is the Government's range of solutions is "zero" as of now. All the Government's projects are focused on Project 2040 and no projects are planned for 2018 or 2019 that would relieve traffic congestion on the M50. There is no project to relieve the standstill which people are experiencing. One of the things that was missing from Project 2040 is the eastern bypass, at which we must look again. I am not a major proponent of building huge roads again but that one is the last piece of the jigsaw around Dublin and it needs to be looked at in a serious way. I await the Minister's response. 
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	325	The Minister is as well aware of this issue as anyone else as congestion on the M50 features regularly on radio and news bulletins. Rush hour on the M50 is now 7 a.m., not 8 a.m. or 9 a.m., such are the volumes of traffic. It is not just the M50 but the feeder roads and their interconnectivity which are affected. Last Friday a truck was involved in an accident on the N4 but it resulted in considerable tailbacks on the M50, as far as Ballymun in one direction and Tallaght on the other side. That is an indication of the scale of the problem and the reliability of transport on the M50. The Minister has previously said that the increase in traffic volumes is as a result of the economy growing and I do not disagree with him on that. The NTA indicated that, in 2016 and 2017, the volume of traffic on the M50 rose by 16%, which is very substantial. By most analyses, the volume of traffic we are experiencing on the M50 today is at a level anticipated by 2023. The challenge is to introduce measures to alleviate the congestion people endure on a daily basis, both on the M50 and on the feeder roads onto and off it, which are all interconnected. It was interesting to see that even a minor issue such as a small breakdown, rather than a fatal or multi-car accident, can bring everything to a standstill. I am not asking the Minister about the long-term plans he has published for 2040 but about steps we can take in the next year or two to address congestion on the M50 and have some short-term impacts.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	326	I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to address this issue in the House today. It is not the first time it has been raised and I readily acknowledge that this is a constant problem that causes a great deal of difficulty for commuters. I fully recognise the pressures on transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, including the M50. Since completion of the major €1 billion upgrade of the M50 in late 2010, annual traffic growth on the route has increased at a typical rate of 6% per annum in line with increased economic growth. More than 170,000 vehicles per day are now using the busiest sections and in excess of 420,000 vehicles use some part of the M50 daily. Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, along with other stakeholders, is continuing to implement a number of measures on the M50 to manage demand and optimise operational efficiency, including: changes to merge and diverge layouts at junctions; the introduction of permanently signed emergency routes; increased incident access points; increased provision of incident response units; and enhanced interagency co-ordination to improve incident management. Traffic incidents which obstruct running lanes are a significant contributor to commuter delays, with 1,429 incidents occurring in 2017 on the M50, over half of which occurred during rush hour traffic. TII's incident response service resolves traffic incidents on the M50 as quickly as possible. The average response time for the M50 in 2017 was approximately 12 minutes. TII has also established a project team to manage the development of a programme for enhancing motorway operation services, which involves the implementation by 2020 of traffic control measures on the M50, including variable speed limits and dynamic lane closures. The aim of this programme is to improve operational efficiency by smoothing traffic flow, improving journey time reliability and reducing the number of secondary traffic collisions. In so far as congestion issues in Dublin are concerned, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has overall responsibility for the implementation of its published transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA. Congestion is not confined to a single corridor in the Dublin region and it cannot be solved by focusing on just one or two corridors. This GDA transport strategy provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area over the next two decades. The strategy sets out a range of measures, including public transport investment and demand management measures, particularly in relation to the operation of the M50, which would reduce the time spent travelling on the network and alleviate congestion. The measures proposed in the strategy are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region. While the management of the M50 falls within the remit of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, an interagency approach which includes Tll, the NTA and the relevant local authorities is required to achieve this. The national development plan, which was launched earlier this year by Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, identifies a number of key public transport priorities including the BusConnects programme, MetroLink and the DART expansion programme. These will be delivered by the NTA progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to deliver a comprehensive public transport network to match transport demand, alleviate congestion, provide an alternative to private car use and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade. This will ensure that an integrated approach to the management of travel demand on the M50 corridor and connecting national roads, combined with the provision of alternative transport modes, is pursued such that the M50 is allowed to function for its primary intended purpose as a national road which caters for predominantly non-local trips of high economic value.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	327	The Minister's response was focused on Project 2040 and big projects and he did not even mention the air and noise pollution impact on people who live along the corridors. There is no public transport using the M50 and it must be the only city motorway in the Europe that does not have public transport corridors or separated public transport corridors. There are no park and ride facilities on the major junctions along the M50 where people could park and avail of public transport, and no major employers have been issued with bus licences that could help ferry their employees to work and reduce their reliance on the M50. There are no measures for the next year or two. I am alarmed to hear the Minister talk of "demand management measures". That is a reference to tolling. Is he saying the Government approves of and supports additional tolling along the M50? That would have a catastrophic impact on the residential and suburban areas which feed onto the M50.

He said a team was engaged on this but we would like to see the detail of this because 2020 is not that far away. He also said the M50 needs to be allowed to function for its primary intended purpose as a national road which caters for predominantly non-local trips of high economic value.We have missed that boat in the sense that Dublin has grown beyond the M50, significantly so. If that is the objective the Minister has in mind, an outer ring road needs to be developed because the M50 has become an integral part of city life in Dublin and can no longer serve that objective. As long as that remains the objective, we will have congestion on the M50 and the roads that connect to it. I urge the Minister to give consideration to the development of an outer ring road.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	On the issue raised by Deputy John Curran, we do not intend to develop an outer orbital route. It is not in our plans and not feasible. The National Transport Authority's greater Dublin area strategy does not include such a project because it would be incredibly expensive. It also recommends protection of this corridor. The suggestion made by Deputies John Lahart and John Curran that everything I mention is Project 2040 focused is somewhat unfair. It is the nature of government and opposition that the former will always look for long-term alleviation measures and the latter short-term alleviation measures. It would be absurd for me to say I have a short-term solution to the problem of congestion on the M50 because I do not. Congestion on the M50 will continue in the short term. We have introduced a number of measures to alleviate it which I have outlined and intend to introduce many more which are not Project 2040 orientated. For example, the Luas cross-city service, which is carrying an extra 10 million passengers per year, will alleviate traffic congestion to some extent. BusConnects, in which we are investing €750 million plus, will commence operations next year, while MetroLink, on which work will commence in 2021, will be operational in 2027 which is a long way from 2040. We have already extended the Luas service and propose to introduce further park and ride facilities. We have introduced a number of measures, but we also have plans up to 2027 to remove thousands of people per day from their cars. I am not suggesting there is a panacea to traffic congestion on the M50. We have to optimise its use, but we are dong what is necessary to get people out of their cars onto public transport, which would automatically lead to a reduction in congestion on the M50.

I welcome the opportunity to refer to the ongoing crisis in diabetes care services in the north west. I use the term "crisis" in its truest sense because that is exactly what it is. The latest HSE data for patient care and waiting times in Letterkenny University Hospital show the true extent of the crisis. For example, adults with type 1 diabetes continue to wait for up to one year for routine appointments and up to two years for follow-up appointments, despite the HSE guidelines recommending that patients with type 1 diabetes be reviewed every six months. We all know that in comparison with the general population patients with diabetes are at a significantly greater risk of developing one or more severe health complications owing to their condition. Without a doubt, these figures make for harrowing reading. Cardiovascular disease, reduced kidney function, uropathy, eye damage and amputation are some of the many complications associated with the condition if symptoms go unchecked. Given that all of this is avoidable with appropriate and timely medical intervention, it is reasonable to assume that given the delays, patients in counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo face a heightened risk of suffering from such complications. Serious resource and staffing problems continue to go unsolved throughout diabetes services in the north west, including in paediatric, transitional and adult diabetes care services. With reference to adult care services, a second additional full-time endocrinologist post remains unfilled, despite the fact that it has been sanctioned by the HSE advisory committee. Similarly, parents and advocacy groups have expressed disappointment that the vacant consultant post at Sligo University Hospital is unlikely to be filled by a consultant paediatric endocrinologist to complement the diabetes services provided in the hospital. At Letterkenny University Hospital, while long overdue efforts are being made to recruit additional dieticians, there is still no sign of a dedicated post for diabetes care. I take no pleasure in reminding the House that despite many commitments made by the Government and the Minister for Health, the Saolta University Health Care Group remains without a centre of excellence for diabetes care. Why are patients in the north west less entitled to these services than their counterparts in the rest of the State? This is postcode healthcare. The people of County Donegal and the north-west region are supposed to feel grateful for the few services offered to them and happy with their lot, but they are not. They are not happy and are standing up and demanding that the Government take action and provide the centre of excellence, the additional full-time endocrinologist, the second post in Sligo University Hospital and that it ensure there will be investment in pump therapy and other areas of diabetes services required for patients in the north west.  This is about saving lives and improved healthcare outcomes. It is also about saving financial resources for the HSE. What action does the Minister propose to take? I demand that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, responds positively to the lack of diabetes services in my home county which has result in people waiting for two years for a follow-up appointment. It is unacceptable that they have to wait that length of time for an appointment.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	333	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this issue on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris. I am aware that Deputy Pearse Doherty has some concerns about the resourcing of diabetes care services in the north west. However, he can be assured that this is a matter the Department, the HSE and the Saolta University Health Care Group are addressing through recruitment and the provision of extra resources in the north west. I understand there is a high demand for the services in the north west due to the elderly population. However, steps are being taken to address this requirement. In Letterkenny University Hospital additional registrar support has been assigned to support the monthly endocrinology clinic. In addition to this extra support, a number of diabetes related posts have been filled in Letterkenny University Hospital. A consultant endocrinologist and a team supported by a consultant physician, with extensive endocrinology experience, have been recruited. Full-time podiatry cover and a clinical nurse specialist have been appointed, in addition to an advanced nurse practitioner in training for the paediatric diabetes service. Further enhancements are planned to address diabetes care services in the north west. Additional posts have been advertised to be filled in Letterkenny University Hospital. A dietician post is being processed by the national recruitment service for appointment, while recruitment of a consultant endocrinologist, a clinical nurse specialist for paediatric diabetes and to another position in the adult service is ongoing. Diabetes services are also being advanced at Sligo University Hospital. Having raised the issue with the Saolta University Health Care Group, the Department of Health has been informed that the procurement process for the diabetes day unit in Sligo University Hospital is under way and the HSE has advised that construction of the new diabetic centre will take place in 2019. On diabetes care services for paediatric patients across the group; a paediatric insulin pump service was initiated in May 2015. This service is based in Sligo University Hospital, with outreach clinics in Letterkenny University Hospital. A locum paediatrician is providing the service in counties Sligo and Donegal, with the permanent post to be advertised in the coming months. In Galway University Hospital a paediatrician is due to take up a post shortly. Diabetes care services are not only provided in an acute care setting; GPs also provide a diabetes cycle of care in the north west. In October 2015 a structured diabetes cycle of care was introduced for adult medical card and GP visit card patients with type 2 diabetes. The cycle of care enables qualifying patients who are registered for the service to avail of two annual visits to their GP for a structured review of their condition.This initiative aims to improve clinical outcomes for patients and reduce complications often experienced with this condition. To date, almost 100,000 patients have been registered nationally for the diabetes cycle of care by their GP. I am aware of the current situation for diabetic care services in the north west and that the Department of Health is monitoring the situation. The Minister notes that the HSE and the Saolta University Healthcare Group are carrying out a broad range of measures in order to improve diabetic care services across the north west.

There is a one year wait for an initial appointment and a two year wait for a recall appointment. There is a reason why the HSE says that a diabetic patient should be recalled every six months. In a four year period this would be eight check-ups if one lives in Cork, Dublin, Waterford, Louth, Monaghan or any of the other counties outside of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. If one happens to live in our region of the country, in the same period a patient only gets two check-ups, if he or she is lucky. The list is getting worse and the length of time is getting worse. We all know. We can talk about health budgets and the amount of money that is spent on treating conditions resulting from diabetes, which is substantial. We know that prevention is better than cure. There are serious consequences, which I outlined to the Minister of State, and the Government is allowing patients to have worse health outcomes because they happen to be born in or live in Donegal and the Government has not sanctioned the necessary personnel in time to deal with their care. There is nothing in what the Minister of State has said that gives me any type of reassurance that the people I deal with daily in Donegal will get recall appointments anytime sooner than two years. The second endocrinologist post was not even mentioned. The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, spoke of a position in Galway but the vacant position in Sligo was not mentioned in the Minister of State's response, nor was the centre of excellence, which the entire Saolta region does not have. When will the people of the north west, the people in my region, be respected by the HSE in providing these services? Imagine if this was my son, my daughter or my wife but because a person lives in a certain part of the State they would get worse care and, therefore, worse outcomes in managing a disease that is manageable if the personnel are available. The advocacy groups met with the Minister. I was there along with other Deputies. We heard all the promises, all the good words and so on. It has not, however, materialised. We need action now. I ask that the Minister of State takes it away and speaks with his officials in the HSE, to ramp up the pressure so we can have real delivery and so we can see the waiting times that are currently going in the wrong direction reversed and put back in the right direction.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	335	I thank the Deputy for his contribution. We are working against a backdrop of an increasing prevalence of diabetes in the community. The diabetes programme established the national diabetes working group with the joint involvement of health care providers in primary, secondary and tertiary care sectors to devise methodologies for caring for these patients. The HSE national clinical programme for diabetes, led by Professor Seán Dinneen, has also established a guideline development group, which is chaired by Dr. Kevin Moore and includes two patients' representatives. I appreciate that some of the national steps will take time to work their way into it, but I assure the Deputy there is recognition of the challenge being presented and there is acknowledgment of the difficulties that exist in the Deputy's area. These challenges are not unique to the Deputy's area but they certainly exist in his area. I will do what the Deputy has asked. I will return, through my Department, back to the HSE to increase the pressure on the management of that service to ensure it is getting the optimum attention from the highest levels within the HSE to address those waiting lists and to address the shortcomings that are in the service, especially around speeding up recruitment. I will certainly do that for the Deputy.

Page 56 of A Programme for a Partnership Government says: "We will maintain a humane approach for discretionary medical card provision." I received a reply to a parliamentary question on 25 April 2018 where I was told it was "neither feasible nor desirable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility." This effectively denies cancer patients an automatic entitlement to a medical card. As far as I can find there is nothing about the medical card application process that is compassionate or humane. I am baffled that there appears to be no political will on the part of the Minister or the Government to extend the medical card to cancer or terminally ill patients. Patients and their families face a financial crisis while they are going through their treatment. The 2015 report, The Real Cost of Cancer, showed how a significant number of patients face a severe drop in income while at the same time running up extra bills on a range of items such as childcare, travel, prescription charges, hospital stays and consultant visits. We cannot lump on any additional financial stress to medical care by making patients jump through bureaucratic hoops, but this is what is happening currently.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	I join my colleague Deputy Scanlon in raising this issue and in seeing how it can be made easier. The reality for people who are suffering from cancer or chronic and long-term illness is extremely difficult. These people have a lot of things going on in their lives; they are trying to deal with the illness and trying to live some sort of a life while dealing with other issues outside of their control with their illness. The painful process of making an application for a medical card is absolutely horrific. I know one young girl who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and she is currently trying to finish her studies and get on with her life. She has made the application for the medical card and has been refused. She was looking for information from external sources, outside of her control. Because her application went outside the three-month window they closed down the application. When I called they said they were sorry but that was it and nothing could be done. This is shocking. I know another young man who has stomach cancer. He is on social welfare and is trying to fight the system to apply for a medical card, an application which is actually getting refused. He has had no success in getting co-operation in this regard. This is wrong. It should be made easier for people who are suffering from cancer or chronic and other long-term illness to access a medical card without going through this horrific process.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	Ireland has an ageing population, but thankfully life expectancy has increased. Some of us, unfortunately, get sick, develop cancer, terminal illness or chronic conditions. This is a time when some people who do not qualify for a medical card need it most. The application process can be quite difficult if one is ill, recently diagnosed, traumatised and vulnerable. Many Oireachtas Members have staff throughout the State who, at times, assist when people find it difficult to fill in forms, especially those people who are not online. A diagnosis of terminal illness is an automatic entitlement to a medical card, but a diagnosis of cancer, which also has a poor outcome but maybe a longer timeline, does not entitle the patient automatically to a medical card. Some people who apply for a medical card find the process difficult enough in normal circumstances. When one is extremely sick and devastated with a prognosis such as cancer, this can prove very difficult and trying.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or ongoing medical care that they cannot afford and for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards granted in an emergency are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the grounds of means or undue hardship and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility. It is also useful to note that in July 2015, the Director General of the HSE made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer with the card to be held for a period of five years. It is undoubtedly important that the medical card application system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, especially arrangements relating to the issuing of medical cards on a discretionary basis. To that end, the HSE has sought to implement revised processes to provide a more compassionate and more efficient process in the assessment of medical card applications. Such measures include the development of a burden of illness questionnaire which is now being rolled out in selective circumstances where the assessing doctor in the HSE's national medical card unit requires a more comprehensive assessment of an applicant's medical and social circumstances and any resulting undue financial hardship. In addition, in January this year, the new streamlined online medical card application system was launched. This will enable applicants to find out immediately if they are eligible for a medical card and will bring considerable benefits for people in turnaround times, convenience and security. Implementation of the measures above will aid the HSE's national medical card unit in providing an enhanced service to applicants, ensuring that the application process is as efficient and timely as possible. It is nonetheless important to note that eligibility for a medical card remains primarily on the basis of financial assistance. This position was endorsed by the HSE's expert group on medical need and medical card eligibility which examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness. That group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility and that a person's means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged. To summarise, I recognise that patients require a responsive and efficient health system to meet their medical needs, which may often be required urgently. The processes in place in the HSE for granting an emergency medical card, the new measures of the burden of illness questionnaire and the online application system are aiding the national medical card unit to provide an enhanced service to applicants, ensuring that the application process is as efficient and timely as possible.

There must be greater awareness. I had a case of a lady who applied online in January. She got her medical card last week despite that she is very ill with cancer and is getting cancer treatment. That is very unfair. There should be people in the medical card office who will look at the applications when they come in and decide whether they need more information on an application or not. Information is being requested two or three weeks later and it is not good enough, particularly in cases where people suffer from cancer.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	With respect, if the Minister of State's reply was the case, we would not need to be here, raising this with him. He outlined and highlighted a process. I had a constituent who was a patient in hospital with cancer, and applied through the hospital for that emergency fast-track system. That patient was told that the condition was not severe enough to allow the person to apply in this way, although it was signed off by a consultant, and that the patient should apply in the normal way. It was horrific. What about the student who was terminally ill and cannot get the paperwork in in time? Her application was closed down after three months. What should happen here, and maybe the Minister of State will discuss it with the officials, is that when an application is made for someone with long-term terminal illness such as cancer or another diagnosis, and the application is accompanied by a letter from a consultant, that should have some fast-track system to get through to get a medical card awarded. That would be instead of the painful, slow process which happens, where people who are suffering dramatically are tortured by the system for information and asked ridiculous questions and for supporting documentation for a terminal condition. It is wrong. If this was happening as the Minister of State says, we would not need to have this Topical Issue debate.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	343	The programme for Government commits to a humane approach to discretionary medical cards for patients undergoing cancer treatment. The guidelines used to award discretionary cards for patients undergoing cancer treatment must be more lenient. They must be more caring. They must be patient-focused. The patient has to come first. They have to look at individual circumstances, case-by-case, as opposed to income only. I am disappointed to see that in the third last paragraph the Minister of State said: "It is nonetheless important to note that eligibility for a medical card remains primarily on the basis of financial assistance." I was contacted during the week by a woman whose dad was diagnosed with stomach cancer at 83 years of age. The man had previously applied for a medical card but unfortunately he only qualified for the doctor only card, being €20 over the weekly limit. The doctor only card was sufficient up to then but now he is 83 and has stomach cancer, so it has to change. I put the emphasis on the patient having to come first.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	I accept what Deputy Scanlon says about greater awareness. The burden of illness questionnaire is very new and many people do not know about it. I had occasion to write to the Secretary General of my own Department recently about my concerns with the application of a constituent. We, as politicians, will always come across the bad cases and the cases that were not dealt with properly, while there are almost 1.6 million in the system who have full medical cards and another 500,000 have general practitioner, GP, visit cards, amounting to over 2 million of the population, but we as representatives will always pick up the cases that were wronged by the system. Our view of the world through that can be overly negative but that does not take from every individual having a right to get what they should, and there should be a process that backs it up. I accept the Deputy's point about increased awareness and I will take that up with the Department to make sure that every GP is aware of the burden of illness questionnaire. Deputy O'Rourke mentioned somebody who is terminally ill and cannot do the paperwork. In that situation, a consultant can write a letter to the medical card section on the part of the patient. I have witnessed these situations. A medical card would be issued immediately without any questions asked if somebody is so terminally ill that he or she cannot do the paperwork. There is a system to deal with that but, as with all systems, it is not perfect and there are always glitches. I welcome the opportunity and attention that people have brought to the issue. Deputy Butler addressed eligibility and financial means. At the end of the day, the medical card will not make anybody better. It will not assist their treatment if they have cancer. We have to be clear on that. All it will do is ensure that they are not under financial burden and we have to be careful with that. People could be diagnosed, as I was myself a number of years ago, with a skin cancer which is something very mild. I do not need a medical card. I did not need it then and I do not need it now. There is not a need for everybody who has been diagnosed with cancer to be given a medical card. It just does not stack up. While it sounds like it would be a good idea, it does not stack up in all cases. It is still about financial eligibility and making sure that there is no additional financial burden whatsoever on people. That is the role of the medical card as opposed to treating the person.

One part of it was an open hearing, during which Tony Taylor was questioned, and then there were two closed material hearings. A month later, the summary was delivered and Tony Taylor and his legal team were told that he would not be released. A core element of the justice system is the right for a person to know the case against him or her. With closed material, the defendant is at a severe disadvantage. A special advocate is appointed by the parole commissioners but this special advocate cannot discuss the case with Tony Taylor. That is not the first example of the injustice of the parole commissioners hearing. I refer to the case of Martin Corey, whose licence was also revoked. He ended up in jail and eventually got a parole commissioners hearing. Four years later, he was released from jail with no charge and no trial. There is also the manner in which Tony Taylor's licence was revoked. He was surrounded by armed personnel in front of his family. One of his children is a child with special physical and mental difficulties. After more than 800 days, Tony Taylor is still in jail and there does not appear to be any way in which he can be released unless there is some proper intervention in the interest of justice.

I thank the Tánaiste for coming in. He is aware of this case. To summarise it on the public record, as Deputy O'Sullivan has said, Tony Taylor is in prison following a revocation of licence. The problem with all of this procedure is that the person whose licence is revoked in the closed procedure never finds out the detail of what is alleged against him or her, nor is there a chance to answer the charges in detail.It is all carried out in a closed system. There had been hope recently that another hearing would take place in the coming months. but I understand it has been deferred for six months by the Secretary of State. The matter must be expedited and a further hearing held in order that Tony Taylor can be released. As the Tánaiste is aware, the group to which he belonged announced a total cessation of violence on 23 January. We must build on it. We must build peace and get action in this case.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	There is no doubt that this is an outrage and a gross violation of human rights. I recall the testimony given to the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement by Ms Lorraine Taylor, wife of Tony Taylor, on the devastating impact the swoop operation which picked up Mr. Taylor more than two years ago had had on their family. He was taken into custody on the vague assertion of the Northern Ireland Office that he was a risk to the public. That claim has not been verified by a court, but he is still incarcerated two years later and no evidence has been presented to him. This is internment by another name and utterly shocking. It is a fundamental right of a democratic justice system that an accused should know the case against him or her. If this was happening anywhere else, we would be up in arms giving out about it. This gross violation of human rights is happening on this island and we must intervene to ensure there will be an early hearing and that this man will be allowed to go back to his family.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	348	The arrest of Tony Taylor on the revocation of his licence in March 2016 was unlawful and did not conform to Article 28(2)(a) or (2)(b) of the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. Detention in the absence of lawful authority is contrary to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This incarceration does not make any sense. It is not positive for Northern Ireland or for building peace. Putting people such as Tony Taylor in prison for no good reason, not charging him and leaving him in limbo is not the way forward. One could be forgiven for suspecting that some people may have a vested interest in the Troubles continuing because this matter is not helping those who are trying to maintain peace.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	349	I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. My officials and I have been following and engaging on this matter on an ongoing basis. Mr. Taylor, who is from Derry, was a member of a dissident republican group in recent years. In 1994 he was sentenced to 18 years in prison after he had been seriously injured in a premature explosion in Derry. He was released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. He served a further three-year sentence from 2011 to 2014 for the possession of a rifle. In March 2016 he was returned to prison after his early release licence was suspended by the then Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers. As I have indicated previously to Deputies, Mr. Taylor’s case has been discussed regularly with the Northern Ireland Office through my officials at the Belfast secretariat. My officials have twice visited Mr. Taylor in Maghaberry Prison, most recently in the past few weeks. The Northern Ireland parole commissioners held a parole hearing in May 2017 on Tony Taylor’s revocation of licence. The decision reached at the hearing was to continue the revocation of licence. A further review by the parole commissioners is under way and there was an expectation that it would conclude in the coming weeks. We understand from discussions with the Northern Ireland Office and Mr. Taylor’s legal representatives that there may be a delay in that process, as referred to by Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív. I am aware that Mr. Taylor has publicly renounced any future engagement in dissident republican activity. I have received a letter from his wife, Lorraine, and I am aware of their difficult family circumstances. I am also aware that there is a level of concern in the nationalist and republican community in Northern Ireland about the basis for and nature of Mr. Taylor’s ongoing detention. They have all been reflected in our ongoing engagement with the Northern Ireland Office on the matter. The recent indication that Mr. Taylor’s new parole hearing may take much longer than expected is of particular concern as he has now been in detention for more than two years without being charged with or convicted of any new offence. My officials and I will continue to monitor developments in the case and raise it with the Northern Ireland Office. I will write to the Secretary of State, Ms Karen Bradley, about the case and will raise it when I meet her in London tomorrow. There are legal sensitivities of which we must be aware, but I understand the growing concern about this matter. Having been in Derry last week, I appreciate how it is contributing negatively to community tensions in an unwelcome way.

It is welcome that he will raise the issue with the Secretary of State tomorrow. The injustice of the treatment of Tony Taylor is undermining the Good Friday Agreement. I want to believe there is a fair and just system and due process in Northern Ireland, but it is not being followed in his case. It seems that delays are in the DNA of the parole commissioners because they were previously encountered in the case of Martin Corey, as I mentioned. The decision to revoke Tony Taylor's licence was taken by the then Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers. She has admitted that it was illegal, but he is still in jail. It is a terrible injustice for him, his family and, in particular, the son for whom he was the prime carer. I hope there will be a resolution of the case and that we will not accept the parole commissioners stating there will be another delay.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	351	I thank the Minister for his succinct answer. Certain issues are within the control of the political system in Northern Ireland. One is the closed and unjust system under which a licence is revoked and one does not know the charges one faces and is not present for the inquiry. A second issue is administrative delay. The Tánaiste was correct when he stated the hearing was expected to take place in the coming weeks, with which we were willing to go along. As he is aware, there should be no fear of releasing this man. The Tánaiste has recognised that Mr. Taylor has stated he will not be involved in sectarian activities. We also have the statement from the organisation to which he belonged. This is not building peace, rather it is doing the opposite. I have written countless times on behalf of a group of Deputies to the former Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers, and the current Secretary of State, Ms Karen Bradley, on the case and requested a meeting with the latter for four Deputies in this House. Will the Tánaiste convey to her our disgust that a Secretary of State does not see fit to meet representatives of the Oireachtas in reasonable time when they request a meeting to discuss a serious matter. I hope that if British MPs wished to meet the Tánaiste, he would immediately give them that courtesy. I have no doubt that he would.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	352	I thank the Tánaiste for his reply. There is a strange irony in the similarity of the cases of Tony Taylor and Ibrahim Halawa. People were justifiably outraged by occurrences in the latter case such as court dates being cancelled, the accused having no clue as to the charges against him and both he and his legal team being left in the dark. That is exactly what is happening on this island to Tony Taylor and his legal representatives. It is setting an incredibly worrying precedent which is adding to political instability in Northern Ireland at a time when some dissident groups have renounced violence and committed to peace. It is undermining that process. It is the continuance of a non-transparent, quasi-judicial legal system that involves gross violations of human rights and it should be consigned to history.I am glad the Tánaiste notes the particular concern and I hope he will raise it, not just with the British authorities but also with his EU counterparts to try to make the British Government sees sense in terms of an early hearing on this issue.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	353	I too welcome the Tánaiste's response. He showed a clear understanding of the problems, the challenges and the injustice. The notion that allegations of wrongdoing could not even be raised against someone and they had to spend more than two years in prison is soul destroying. This is a human rights issue. As the Tánaiste is aware, we go to Maghaberry Prison regularly and it is a scene from hell. In a report published last year it was deemed one of the worst prisons in Europe. Just as some members of the republican side did not accept the Good Friday Agreement, unfortunately, some people on the other side did not accept it either. While there has been huge reform in certain areas in Northern Ireland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, is a serious improvement on the RUC, other areas in the prison service in Northern Ireland leave much to be desired. It would be welcome if the Tánaiste could challenge them on their irrational behaviour.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	354	It is important to say in the context of this debate that while there are genuine and real concerns about this case, I know that all in this House will agree there is no place for violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political aims in Northern Ireland or anywhere in this island. We again call on all those dissident republican groups that have not yet done so to renounce violence and to commit to exclusively democratic pursuit of political aims. I also pay tribute to the work of An Garda Síochána in dealing with ongoing activities and threats posed by dissident groups that have not committed to a peaceful way forward. It is important to say that. I take the Deputy's concerns but there are issues here that clearly others believe are relevant in terms of the ongoing detention of Mr. Taylor. We will continue to raise the concerns that have been raised in this House. They are legitimate. I will be talking to the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, tomorrow but I will put those concerns in writing also. Those conversations have taken place between my officials and officials in the Northern Ireland Office. As I say, our approach will be to continue to monitor this case closely because the case, and the way in which it is handled, has broader repercussions in terms of the broader community in Derry. It needs to be handled sensitively and appropriately and we will engage, as we always do, with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and her team in that regard.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	355	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am happy to move Fianna Fáil's Mental Health Parity Bill 2017 on Second Stage. This Bill, if enacted, will compel a conceptual shift in attitudes and behaviour towards mental health at the highest level of policymaking and governance within the Department of Health and, consequently, the Health Service Executive, HSE. Fianna Fáil’s Bill establishes, on a legislative basis, the principle of parity of esteem of our physical and mental healthcare and identifies a legal mechanism for the Minister to compel the implementation of this principle. This Bill, if enacted, will place a legal duty on the Minister for Health to promote health parity and to ensure all organisations within our health system meet parity obligations in regard to mental health. Ensuring access to timely and appropriate treatment for people with mental health needs on a par with physical health is a major policy concern for the Fianna Fáil Party. The overarching principle of parity of esteem is that of equality. It means, among other points, equality of access to care and treatment, equality of efforts to improve quality of care, and equality of levels of choice of care and treatment. It means the allocation of time, effort and resources on a basis commensurate with need, that mental health has equal status within healthcare education and practice, and that there is equal status in the measurement of health outcomes. It means also that the stigma and prejudice about mental health care and treatment is tackled head on, that there is an understanding, acceptance and execution of the principle that our physical, mental and social health are inextricably intertwined and interdependent, and that there is no health without mental health. One of the key motivations for bringing forward this Bill now is the downgrading of mental health services within the HSE. A Vision for Change requires the appointment of a mental health directorate, yet the HSE recently abolished the role of the national director of mental health and has reverted to the old system of separating strategy and budget responsibility within mental health services. That did not work in the past and it is difficult to understand why it is believed it will work this time. The reality is that the relationship of mental health is that of Cinderella to the Department of Health and the HSE. It is ignored for the most part, regarded as something other or lesser, and is the first to be treated badly in difficult circumstances. That is reflected in the fact that for some time now the investment in mental health as a proportion of the health budget has been decreasing. There is ample evidence that if we place mental health on a parity with physical health in our policies and in our healthcare system, we will improve outcomes for mental, physical and social healthcare. The Government consistently says it has been doing all that it can, but the facts speak for themselves. To provide the Minister with some recent examples, we still have a significant number of children being placed in adult units, some for up to six weeks at a time. Sometimes they are placed in chairs and at other times they are placed in hallways. The recent report from the Mental Health Commission highlighted the fact that it still does not have the powers to regulate community mental health residences, a power that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has in respect of similar non-mental health residences. We have patients being kept in prisons due to a lack of space in adult units. We have a chronic problem of mental health issues linked to social media such as cyberbullying and body dysmorphia, yet there is still no appointment of a digital safety commissioner. We have the revelation that we spend €400 million on psychotropic medicines and only €10 million on community psychology. Our mental health system seems to be geared towards triage and crisis intervention. This is particularly acute in children’s primary care psychology and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. We know that 50% of mental health issues arise before a person turns 14, and 75% arise before they turn 25, yet early intervention for young people is limited, inconsistent and ad hoc. There is clearly a mental health treatment gap with a very significant unmet need in terms of access to care and treatment. That gap must be closed. It is obvious that the mental health area is underfunded, and not just in real or relative terms. It is also underfunded relative to its potential impact. By that I mean that there is evidence that investment in certain early interventions can save more money than the interventions cost. As stated earlier, this Bill, if enacted, will establish on a legislative basis the principle of parity of esteem of our physical and mental healthcare and will place a legal duty on a Minister for Health to promote that parity. I implore Members on all sides of the House to support the Bill.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	356	For someone in a vulnerable position who summons the strength to reach out and seek help while feeling helpless and alone requires a strength like no other. Sadly, too many do not get that vital help when they seek it. Sometimes it is only when someone has taken that drastic decision to try to end their life that the health system kicks in to try to help them survive. What we need is early intervention and more positive action at an early stage. There is no doubt that our mental health service has serious deficiencies which result in long waiting lists for services for some of our most vulnerable citizens. We are all aware of where the problems lie. Chronic underfunding is a massive issue. Even the 8.2% figure set out in A Vision for Change has yet to be met. For all the talk about mental health as a political priority, we remain far below the 13% figure we managed in the 1980s. Without a meaningful and sustained increase in overall levels of funding, we will not be able to tackle the mental health crisis in our society. The Mental Health Commission's recent reports on 43 units made for alarming reading, with serious deficiencies found in many of the residences, including the Lakeview unit in Naas and in Portlaoise, where there is an agreement on transfer late at night. This Bill does not aim to solve the funding, staffing and morale problems in mental health services. Rather, it will ensure that, going forward, mental health will be placed, rightfully, at the heart of all key decisions made by the Department of Health.That will require a conceptual shift in attitudes towards mental health at all levels of policy making and governance. Mental health must be placed on an equal footing with physical health and given the parity of esteem to which it is entitled. This means equal access to effective care and treatment and equal efforts to improve the quality of care our constituents receive. It also means equal status within healthcare, education, practice and measures of outcomes. Mental health supports need to be holistic, providing individuals with care that addresses their physical and mental needs equally. Urgent action is needed to address the crisis. As a society, we need to move beyond the so-called stubborn stigma and treat mental and physical illnesses in the same way. Compassion, acceptance and kindness are the cornerstones of a caring and compassionate society and should be reflected in healthcare policies and adequate levels of funding for mental health care.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	357	I commend my colleague Deputy James Browne for introducing this Bill which seeks to put mental health on a par with physical health. The aim is to provide equality of access to care and treatment for every patient. There is no doubt, given the lack of resources, that we are now rationing mental health services. People who need treatments and therapies are being told that they can access one, two or three hours of same but no more than that. That is not sufficient to deal with patients' needs and provide them with the services they require. Only 6% of the overall health budget is spent on mental health services which is very low by international standards and must be increased. One of the key issues that needs to be addressed is the lack of out-of-hours mental health services, particularly in rural communities such as mine in County Mayo where the only out-of-hours option is to present at the emergency department. Let us think about that for one moment; think about a person in severe mental distress presenting at an emergency department which is overcrowded, under-resourced, manic and chaotic. That is no place for somebody suffering with severe mental health difficulties. The cost of treatment is also an issue. Cognitive behavioural therapies, CBT, and other talk therapies which we know are effective are not being provided to the level required. Medication is often the first port of call and while there is a place for it, we must also adequately resource the provision of talk therapies. A single CBT session can cost between €80 and €120 per hour, which is far beyond the reach of most individuals. Many talk therapies are out of the reach of people who are relying on the public health system and cannot gain access to such treatments. We do not have equality of access to care and treatment. If someone has private health insurance or adequate resources to pay for private treatment, he or she will probably be okay, but the public health system is not functioning properly for those with mental health difficulties who do not have insurance or sufficient means. We see the reliance of many on organisations such as Pieta House, the annual fundraising walk of which, Darkness into Light, will take place soon. That annual event shows that communities and citizens across the country are voluntarily giving of their time and money to fund mental health services which should be funded by the State. If we did not have such voluntary services and charitable organisations, where would we be? Many communities would be devoid of any mental health service.  I commend the Bill to the House and urge the Government to address both the non-existence of out-of-hours services in most communities and the very low percentage of the overall health budget spent on mental health services.
#JackieCahill	unknown-#JackieCahill-party	unknown-#JackieCahill-dob	unknown-#JackieCahill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	358	I commend Deputy James Browne on bringing the Bill before the House. I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, for meeting me and Deputies Mattie McGrath and Seamus Healy earlier today.  I will be very parochial in my comments because there is a crisis in health services in my county. In County Tipperary we have no psychiatric bed of any description. We were promised capital investment in South Tipperary General Hospital and if such capital investment is forthcoming, it is essential that a psychiatric unit form part of it. We also need a psychiatric unit in Nenagh in the north of the county. We have mental health clinics in the county which are completely under-resourced and both GPs and patients have lost faith in them. A GP visited my constituency clinic in Thurles last Saturday morning and told me that he would no longer refer any of his patients to the mental health clinic in Thurles, which serves 34,000 people. In recent weeks three teenagers have been in the paediatric unit in Clonmel hospital - one has been there for 11 weeks - while awaiting admittance to an acute psychiatric unit in Cork for adolescents. The position is just untenable. When Deputy Helen McEntee was Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health services, we were promised a Jigsaw project in County Tipperary, but that has not happened. The county is in crisis in mental health services which are completely under-resourced. We need funding for psychiatric beds and mental health clinics to be properly resourced.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	359	As we discuss this issue I am always conscious of those in the Chamber who have suffered heartbreak. We should always reflect for a short time out of respect for their suffering and to let them know that we share that heartbreak. It is also true for many associated with this House and the many thousands outside who have been affected by mental health issues. I commend Deputy James Browne who has done extraordinary work on this issue, as Members of the House will acknowledge. We must stop the repeated failing of people with mental health issues. Unfortunately, when it comes to mental health services, County Roscommon has been in the headlines for all of the wrong reasons. Members will be familiar with the external review of mental health services in the county. It was a damning indictment of a service in crisis mode. It found a service in which a culture of blame, secrecy and negativity abounded. Following the review it was suggested the committee's 27 recommendations be implemented without delay. A management team was put in place but to this day, as far as I am aware, very few, if any, of the recommendations have been implemented. The programme for Government contains a commitment to improving mental health services throughout the country. Like my colleague Deputy Jackie Cahill, I am being parochial because what has happened in my county is appalling and outrageous, although I know that the situation is almost as bad in other parts of the country. We must remember that the aforementioned external review commenced in August 2015 but was not completed until September 2017. Despite the seriousness of the situation, it took two years for the report to be finalised. I will not speak any further about this matter because the facts speak for themselves and we all know what we have to do.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to review the situation in County Roscommon and ensure the 27 recommendations made by the external reviewers will be implemented as quickly as possible.

I have addressed the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Jim Daly, and his predecessor, Deputy Helen McEntee, on numerous occasions on the issue of mental health. I must acknowledge that we now have an Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care which is drilling down deep into the subject. The committee has been bringing in guest speakers who have been telling members about what is happening on the ground. In recent weeks representatives from Community Health Office, CHO, 2, covering the Galway area, were before the committee and told members that there were 20 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, beds for nine counties. In the context of the Mental Health Parity Bill, that spells it out clearly for me. There are only 20 CAMHS beds to cover nine counties, which is in no way sufficient. The aforementioned Oireachtas committee has also learned a lot about the great work certain groups are doing in their communities in supporting young people. We heard from the Galway branch of Youth Work Ireland, which is providing a youth counselling service. That service has helped 200 vulnerable children in sixth class in primary school through to third year in secondary school. They had issues in adjusting to secondary school. The counselling service is receiving referrals from Tusla and schools because they recognise the importance of early intervention. There are some very appropriate and easy ways for us to improve matters and there is some low hanging fruit of which we can take ownership, but mental health must be on a par with physical health and treated equally.

For far too long, mental health has been seen as the poor relation in the health services. The shortcomings in mental health care have been outlined on numerous occasions, most recently in last week's "The Big Picture - Young and Troubled", which focused on adolescents who are seeking emergency help. When one looks beyond the services, one sees there is a great deal of goodwill and energy at grassroots level. People are volunteering their time, funds and efforts to plug the gaps that are being left by the State. For example, the Darkness into Light walks will take place on many doorsteps next week. Walks have been organised in many places in my constituency, including Inchigeelagh, Ballincollig, Kilmurry and Aghabullogue. Many cyclists from around the country, including my sister, Gobnait Moynihan, who is a local county councillor in Macroom, are taking part in the Cycle against Suicide tour of the country at present. They are volunteering their time and effort to increase the profile of these issues and to raise the funds that are needed to plug the gaps I have mentioned. The message is that mental health has to be on an equal footing with physical health.

Various policy documents have been published, but unfortunately they have not translated into mainstream health provision as we would have liked. Despite all the commitments and the improvements in monetary allocations within the budget system, it has been difficult to put enough professionals in place to meet the level of demand we regularly encounter at our clinics and elsewhere. Even though magnificent work is being done by people in the voluntary sector and advances have been made in other areas of healthy living that improve the health of the mind, many people are still not able to access the sorts of facilities we would expect everyone to be able to access in the modern society we live in. A Bill like this is essential to ensure in legislation that this country provides access to facilities, services and care in a way that is comparable to all other aspects of health provision to which we aspire. I want to add my voice to the voices of many Deputies on all sides of the House, of all parties and none, who are keen to enable the Dáil to be in a position to ensure these services and facilities are easily accessed. It is because we regularly leave our clinics with a great sense of frustration and worry that we are seeking to ensure a level of expertise and professionalism of which we can be proud is available in our health service. As legislators and as elected representatives, we cannot sleep easily if we do not know full well that services and facilities which should be available as a matter of course are in place. Everyone has a duty to ensure such services and facilities are provided.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	363	I fully support the contention that as a Government and as an Oireachtas, we must continue to do everything we can to address the mental health issues faced by many of our citizens. I am sure all Members of the House agree that we must prioritise our work on enhancing mental health and well-being. I acknowledge Deputy Browne’s commitment to maintaining a focus on mental health. I assure Deputies that the Government will continue to promote a comprehensive health service that is designed to secure improvements in the physical and mental health of all our people. The stated aim of the Mental Health Parity Bill 2017, which is sponsored by Deputy Browne and was published on 26 September 2017, is to place mental health on a par with physical health with a view to securing improvements in physical and mental health and in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental illnesses. The Government does not oppose the Bill in principle. While the maintenance of the equal status enjoyed by mental and physical health in the health care system is a laudable and desirable objective, the Government has some concerns about the legislation that has been proposed. Its aims are general and aspirational in nature and appear to differ from the background to and stated purpose of the Bill as set out in the explanatory memorandum. In its current form, the Bill raises serious questions regarding how we can achieve the aims that have been set out through additional legislation. The World Health Organization's definition of health, which has not been changed since 1948, provides that health is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". This broad holistic definition of health recognises the interconnectedness of the various factors that contribute to overall health and does not seek to prioritise any one factor over another. Under the Health Act 2004, the purpose of the HSE is "to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public". The same Act clarifies that the HSE "shall manage and shall deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services". This makes it clear that mental health is acknowledged as an inherent component of health and health legislation, part of and indivisible from the whole. Deputy Browne's Bill seems to refer to this in its effort to ensure "the Minister for Health shall continue the promotion of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvements in physical and mental health". Legislation must be clear and specific and should be, to the greatest extent possible, easily understood. The inclusion of policy aspirations in legislation is not generally regarded as good practice. The implications of such an approach can be difficult to predict. The possibility of unforeseen and potentially negative unintended outcomes must be borne in mind. It may be easy from a policy point of view to understand putting mental health services on a par with physical health, but what does that mean when it is put on a statutory footing? How do we determine in precise legal terms whether a service delivered for an individual in one context can be equated with another service delivered for another person in a different context? Does the existing legislative text not already imply that all health, both mental and physical, should already be delivered on an equal basis? If so, how is that to be measured? In the limited time available to it, the Department of Health has not identified a model in other jurisdictions for legislating for mental health parity. The British Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has a legal duty to secure improvements in the physical and mental health of the people and in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental illness. It is not clear that the concept of parity could be given a legal basis and, even if it could, that it could be operationalised in light of the vast spectrum of illnesses that influence both physical and mental health. Another of the stated aims of the Bill is to compel the integration of mental health services with physical health services. This is already legislated for in the Health Act 2004, which states that the HSE shall "integrate the delivery of health and personal social services". Over the last decade, there has been a move away from the traditional psychiatric hospital model to treatment in specialist units associated with acute hospitals. Ultimately, there should be a focus on achieving the best outcomes for people who are suffering from mental illnesses. I have concerns about whether a prescriptive legislative approach is an appropriate method of achieving that focus. The draft Bill has not yet been discussed with Deputy Browne. Along with officials from my Department, I intend to meet the Deputy to discuss the aspirations of the draft Bill with a view to establishing whether and how an amended wording might be considered. We need to consider whether the stated aims of this Bill can be achieved by legislation, or are already being implemented more effectively through existing health policy. I will expand on the implementation of various initiatives in mental health shortly. While the importance of legislation cannot be overstated, laws in and of themselves do not heal people - only treatment and services can do that. The Deputy hopes this Bill will result in mental health issues informing the highest level of policy making and governance. I assure him that mental health is and will remain a priority for the Government. Since 2012, approximately €200 million, or 28%, has been added to the HSE mental health budget, which now totals over €910 million. This extra funding has allowed us to approve approximately 1,800 new mental health posts over this period. Funding has been provided to recruit 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists in primary care and 111 of those assistant psychologists have now been recruited. In addition, funding has been provided to increase the number of undergraduate psychiatric nurses by 130 per year. This will bring the total number of psychiatric nurses graduating each year to 400 by 2021. A comparative positioning of Ireland internationally suggests that the percentage resource allocation today is close to the median level across EU member states. The Government is committed to increasing funding as circumstances allow. Of course there are challenges in agreeing what does and does not constitute mental health spending. If the percentage spend on mental health is to be increased, it may mean reducing the spend elsewhere in the health budget or increasing allocations to mental health far more than increases in all other areas over a fixed period of time. If the percentage of the overall budget assigned to mental health is to be ring-fenced, it opens the possibility for applications to ring-fence funding for other specific areas of care, such as cancer and maternity services.As I have said, significant work is required to establish fully how robust legislation can be drafted that achieves the stated goals of this Bill while avoiding unforeseen and undesirable outcomes. This will be the focus of my officials' work in the immediate future. On the basis of these further discussions that will take place, the Government does not intend to oppose Deputy Browne's Bill at this time.

The crux of the Bill is something we have been trying to address for some time in this country and, historically, we have treated mental health differently, including how we engage with people with mental health problems, how we address them and the funding given to the mental health area. However, I do not agree that in recent times mental health has been treated badly. The Minister of State has already outlined that our budget has increased by 28% or €200 million, which is significant given the times we were in and that other budgets were cut significantly. I thank the Minister of State for allowing me to share this time with him and I know Government time is short with Private Members' business. Allowing time to debate this is very important. I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Jim Daly, to this area and his offer to work with Deputy Browne to ensure the intention of the Bill can be achieved. We all hope this can be achieved through an agreed text that is legislatively sound and effects change. I note the concerns of the Minister of State from a legal perspective, and to be viable perhaps the Bill needs to be a little clearer and specific, taking into account good practice, as we are talking about policy aspirations in legislation and that generally does not happen. However, the intention and statement of the Bill is that mental health should be addressed in the same way and with the same urgency and care as physical health. There should be no distinction between the two when it comes to care and treatment. I acknowledge the Minister of State's comments that the Government takes into account the 1948 World Health Organization definition of health, which is unchanged since that time. It defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of ill health, disease or infirmity. In other words, we are looking at a holistic approach. This is about ensuring everything we do as a Government takes into account services and the right kind of support for people who need services at a time when they need them. When we speak about diagnosis and prevention in particular, mental health should be on a par with physical health. I have had the opportunity to engage with many organisations over many years. Over the weekend, I had two fantastic volunteers taking part in Cycle Against Suicide stay as part of a home stay. I had the opportunity on Sunday morning to speak to our cyclists as they headed off on their day. I was asked to encourage people to look after their own mental health. From my time as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and my engagement with young people, I know the only way we will be able to put mental and physical health on a par is to teach people from an early age to look after their health. We must encourage them to eat well, get enough sleep, exercise regularly and speak with somebody if they are not feeling well. Bringing benefits to physical and mental health will only come about through improving services together and not separately; we must not separate our physical and mental health. It is somewhat of a paradox that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health. It highlights the importance placed by the Government on mental health but it also takes away from it in that we are separating it from physical health and putting it in a separate box. I commend the Deputy on raising this as an issue and it is something we have been trying to deal with it. As it stands, the Government is trying to ensure that services are improved in mental health in the same way as they are in physical health. We are looking to ensure that funding can be increased in mental health in the same way as it is with physical health, with the outcomes being essentially the same with respect to prevention, diagnosis and treating people.
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	I commend Deputy Browne on bringing forward this Bill. I am glad to have an opportunity to speak more on mental health in the Dáil. As I have said many times, the mental health services have a responsibility to address and to treat mental ill health. These are two of the biggest issues I come across on a daily basis in my work as a public representative. Everything in our lives impacts on our relative state of mental health. This includes our work, education, family, social lives and the climate we live in culturally, politically and environmentally. Our mental health is also tied to our physical health and vice versa. Prolonged illness in either regard has an impact on the other. The parity of mental and physical health is an undeniable fact because of this link and there is potential for either pillar of our health to have a devastating effect on our quality of life should illness befall us and go untreated or unresolved. This does not necessarily affect the policy of this Government. Political decisions are far too often not based on fact, rational decision making or even what is effective but on compromise in order to serve an ideological goal. Mental health sits not in parity with physical health but quite far below it in Government policy. It is often seen as a soft touch where Government divestment from public service provision could be pursued and important functions of State institutions could be outsourced to community and voluntary bodies, undermining service provision and the rights of workers and patients in turn. The problem is not one of law, although we support this Bill. It is one of policy and political will. Mental health services are seen by the political class that has run this country for decades as an expensive and complicated burden, much like housing. That does not change with a paragraph of stand-alone legislation but it can change with real policy and real political will to deliver world-class public services as a function of a State that sees its role as one of caring and providing for its citizens. This would be a good point to remember when Fianna Fáil discusses its relationship with Fine Gael as an enabler to a Government that has completely failed to address the problems in our mental health services, which although complicated by their enduring presence are essentially the day-to-day tasks of running a service. There are difficulties with recruitment but they would be far less damaging to our service if they had not been allowed to deepen by heaping the brunt of austerity on people working in them over many years. This affected nurses, in particular, but all levels of the mental health service have had to work in chaotic, dysfunctional and sometimes dangerous conditions, overworked and too often underpaid. That problem was allowed to develop without intervention for many years and now with services at breaking point and national scandals like the crisis in CAMHS, it is a Government problem of its own making, although it is not insurmountable. We cannot play the waiting game while lives are at stake, hoping unrealistically that things will get better. No medical professional would ever advise a patient to ignore a problem and hope it goes away, and nor should any Government. Speaking on First Stage, Deputy James Browne, who has given his support to this Government stated:It sets out a pathway for addressing staff shortages and other resourcing issues affecting our mental health services. It is imperative that all organisations within our health system need parity obligations and this Bill will help bring Ireland into line with international standards on the provision of mental health care.This Bill does not provide a pathway to anything other than speaking time in the Dáil. There is a pathway for addressing the problems he correctly outlines as being seriously damaging to our services. That pathway is the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare and the recommendations of its interim report on which the Deputy, I and others have worked on. Fianna Fáil should be using its position to hold this Government to account on these issues and ensuring speedy implementation of this pathway. This Bill, however well-meaning, will not do that. We need a more positive and realistic approach and I appeal to all parties to stop the talking and head-nodding. Now is the time to invest in our mental health services. We should remember that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael did not support our proposals for €37.5 million in additional funding in 2016 or the roll-out of 24-7 services. The Minister of State mentioned a while ago an additional 1,800 new posts but the latest report I have is that 1,700 staff could be lost in the next five years due to retirement. That will have a negative effect again. I will finish by calling on the Minister of State to commit to maintaining the mental health committee beyond the final publication of its report and indefinitely to work in parallel to the health committee. That would be a real step towards parity. I know Deputy Browne supports this and I ask that he bring the full weight of his party on the Government in seeing this become a reality.

It is an issue close to home for me. I do not want to talk about the waiting times because we all know there are significant delays in getting into CAMHS. The waiting times are disgraceful. There is nothing we can say about that only that we need to recruit more staff so that there are not waiting times. I want to talk about when a person first realises that their child potentially has a mental health difficulty. It could be the parent who notices or it could be a teacher who brings this to the parent's attention. It is a difficult thing to deal with. No matter what is said and no matter how often it is said it is okay not to be okay, a parent still feels he or she is still failing a child if he or she has to access CAMHS. There is no point saying anything else about that. I find it is an extremely faceless service. It is all paperwork. The bunch of forms are asking questions at a time when it is hard to process what is going on and what the difficulties might be. People have 14 days to return the forms. Then a whole load of information about drop-in and walk-in clinics is sent out. It states that if a parent is concerned for a child, he or she can drop into this or that clinic. Of course the parent is concerned for his or her child. That is why he or she is accessing CAMHS in the first place. Much of the information is difficult to digest and it has to be dealt with at an already difficult time in the lives of parents and children. Many people at that point just cannot cope with it and do not know where to go or what to do with the information. It would be far better if there was a phone service or a face to face service where people could go in and speak to someone who could assist with the forms. A parent is not a mental health expert and cannot say what category a child falls into. That is really important because we need to have it as an accessible service at the very start. Then we need to look at the waiting times. It is extremely frustrating when a parent knows there is a difficulty but cannot do anything about it. As a parent, not being able to help a child is one of the worse feelings in the whole world. The child is on a waiting list and the parent is pulling his or her hair out trying to deal with it. It is okay for people who can access private services. However, not everyone is going to be able to do that and not all the private services suit children's mental health. We need to make CAMHS much more accessible, much more friendly, much more helpful and we definitely need to look at the waiting times and the lists. We need to ensure children are not left languishing on a list and then turn into an adult with even more difficulties and problems.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	367	I have raised this issue many times with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and with others here. Staffing is the problem. It is a problem for the service users but also a huge problem for the people working in the service. I have come across people in a stressed situation on numerous occasions. I was recently talking to someone working in the administration side of CAMHS. She is nearly in need of mental health services herself at this stage. She feels terrible talking to parents and to people and making up excuses as to why there is not a service for them. This person is now looking for work elsewhere. The pay is fine, it suits her and she is happy to be in the employment she is in. However, she is continually stressed at finding herself in the position the system has put her in. She is becoming a block to people getting the service. When the phone rings, she is the person who has to try to deal people who are in a terrible state because their child is suicidal, self-harming or is in a difficult situation. They are trying to get an appointment with a psychologist that in many cases does not exist or are they trying to get a review of medication that was done six or eight months ago and they cannot get an appointment to get that review to happen. I refer to the mental health service in all its aspects. It is the same in the adult health mental service. A mental health nurse in Sligo tells me that the position is the same there. They are understaffed and conscious that their service is not up to scratch. These people are dedicated to what they do. They feel they are letting down the public. Then they look around and recognise that the reason is that there are not enough of them. It is as simple as that. Additional staff is the one thing that would make the biggest difference to the mental health services. The Minister of State has said that more money has been put in and there has been an increase here and there. I acknowledge that. Those increases have come in the aftermath of such a terrible disaster over the last ten to 15 years. The service was gutted. When there is a crisis in government or in the economy, the first part of the service to be hit is the community service and the services that are at their weakest. Mental health fits into that category nicely. Bringing parity to this is certainly required. What we really have to do, though, is recognise that mental health services are a priority. It has to be made a priority not just of the Department of Health but of the Government.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	I thank Deputy James Browne for bringing forward this Bill. It gives us the opportunity to highlight the inadequate funding for mental health and the continual reluctance of the Government to address the problem. I am aware of the need for more funding and resources for mental health in my constituency of Limerick City. I commend Jigsaw in Limerick city. I visited that project recently and it does great work in offering mental health support to young people and their families. Jigsaw aims to ensure that no young person feels alone, isolated and disconnected from others around them. It provides vital supports to the mental health of young people by working closely with communities across Ireland. Limerick Suicide Watch also provides an invaluable service in Limerick city. It patrols our streets at night time. Unfortunately, its services are needed far too often. The huge efforts of these volunteers should not go overlooked. They are a credit to our city. Data compiled earlier in the year by the national suicide research foundation found that from 2014 to 2016 the average rate of suicide in Limerick city was 23.7 per 100,000. This is higher than the last report from 2011 to 2013. That recorded a rate of 22.4, in the midst of the economic crisis and austerity when suicide tends to increase. While the figures for suicide nationally are declining slightly, unfortunately Limerick figures have risen. It is both shocking and upsetting that the suicide rate for Limerick city is more than twice the national average of 10.5. This clearly demonstrates that a properly resourced 24-7 crisis intervention service is essential for our region. In 2015, figures also showed that 425 people took their own lives nationally and that twice or three times as many men as women die by suicide. Unfortunately, accurate figures for death by suicide are hard to obtain, as the Minister of State knows. Many other cases of death by suicide have been recorded as accidental death when the individual may have died by suicide. The only way to get real figures and a true insight as to the actual rate of death by suicide is by talking and listening to the families that have lost loved ones. In 2016, the national self-harm registry Ireland recorded 11,485 presentations to hospitals due to self-harm. Accident and emergency departments do not offer appropriate care or follow up for those in acute mental stress. I know that from friends. The provision of 24-7 crisis intervention services is required. That could provide assistance to people day or night when they require help and hopefully reduce the number of suicides. Currently, there are 2,603 children and adolescents waiting for an appointment with a CAMHS team, which treat vulnerable children in Ireland with moderate to severe mental health problems. This is largely due to a failure to recruit the staff needed to operate a CAMHS team fully. Currently, and for quite some time, about half the positions in CAMHS teams across the country are vacant. Figures released recently to Sinn Féin also show that the child and adult mental health team in the Limerick region is operating with only 58.7% of the recommended staff set out in the strategy, A Vision for Change. That strategy recommends that youth mental health services be fully staffed at 1,047 people. As of December 2017, however, the CAMHS teams had just 587 doctors and nurses. The sad reality is that without adequate resources and the provision of proper services for those in acute mental distress, the figures for death by suicide by self-harm will only continue to increase. The Government needs to sit up and take notice of the public desire for more funding and resources to be allocated for mental health services across the State.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	I commend Deputy James Browne on his work on this Bill and express the support of the Labour Party for it. Ireland, and indeed the world, has come a long way in respect of mental health but a lot remains to be done.It is poignant that we are discussing Second Stage of the Bill at this point, given that the Darkness Into Light event run by Pieta House takes place on 12 May, a little over a week from now. I imagine Members across the House will join me in praising this fantastic initiative which aims to raise awareness and funds for people suffering from mental illness. I encourage people to take part, if possible. I shout out to some of my friends, including Mick Matthews, Jackie Morrison and those involved in the Skerries Cycle Against Suicide group. The intention of the Bill is to place mental health on a par with physical health. It is an important Bill which, if enacted, will bring Ireland further into line with international best practice in medicine. I hope it will be enacted soon. Our goal should always be to treat a patient with a mental health issue with the same compassion and clinical excellence we would expect for someone with a physical health issue. I am keen to reference some examples from overseas related to mental health parity or parity of esteem, as it is also known. In the United Kingdom the then NHS director for people with long-term conditions, Dr. Martin McShane, succinctly put the issue of parity of esteem for mental health on the table in 2014. He stated:To me parity of esteem means tackling mental health issues with the same energy and priority as we have tackled physical illness.It is about changing the experience for people who require help with mental health problems.It is about putting funding, commissioning and training on a par with physical health services.And parity of esteem is about tackling and ending the stigma and prejudice within the NHS which stop people with serious mental health problems getting treated with the same vigour as if they had a physical illness such as, say, diabetes.That stigma can be demonstrated like this: if you fall down and break your hip, an ambulance will be with you in eight minutes to give emergency care at the scene before taking you to A&E. If, however, you suffer an acute psychotic episode in the street, you are just as likely to be attended by a police car and taken to a cell.We must end the stigma associated so often with mental health. We must raise awareness of the importance of mental health care and recognise the inadequacies of how we have regarded mental health in the past. This means raising awareness within the NHS itself. And we must create parity for mental health care in reality – rather than just issuing rhetoric and paying lip service to it.On 2 February 2011 the British Government published a 109 page report entitled, No health without mental health – a cross-government mental health outcomes strategy for people of all ages. The comprehensive document listed key achievements required to bring the NHS up to date in mental health care. The report references the fact that there are many interdependencies between physical and mental health. In principle, this is a departure from prior thinking, which suggested mental health was a separate and distinct area never truly considered to be on a par with physical health. The NHS mandate 2014 to 2015 directly states the objective of the NHS is to put mental health on a par with physical health. That is what the Bill also seeks to achieve. In 2009 Harvard Medical School published an article entitled, Benefitting from mental health parity. The article referred to the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act 2008 which came into law in the United States on 1 of October in that year. Prior to enactment patients suffering from bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia were liable to vast costs. Many insurance plans now fully cover these illnesses. The importance of the Mental Health Parity Bill 2017 is the proposed establishment of a legal commitment to have equal and due regard for psychiatric patients when provision is being made for improvements in the health service. In Ireland today we bear witness to children waiting 15 months to see a psychologist and, more generally, a total of 2,500 young people awaiting access to public mental health services. There is a crisis in the provision of child and adolescent mental health services. General practitioners are referring patients to a waiting list because there is a serious lack of immediate counselling services available. This, in turn, has a knock-on effect on the clinical outcome for these patients. A striking example arises in cases of moderate to severe depression, in which a combination of medication and psychotherapy is recognised as the optimum treatment. Owing to the lack of psychotherapists, a shortage of cognitive behavioural therapy specialists, an inability to fill vacancies for adult and child psychiatrists, as well as the shortage of other mental health care specialists, patients are often left solely on anti-depressant medication without the additional counselling intervention that has been proved to be beneficial in tackling the underlying issue. I am dealing with a mother who is at her wits' end because her son is being left on anti-depressant medication and nothing beyond. It is frustrating and unacceptable. It is important to note that currently private health insurance cover has a focus on inpatient psychiatric care as opposed to care on an outpatient or community basis. For example, there is full cover available for inpatients in a psychiatric hospital up to 100 days per calendar year. There is a separate arrangement for people suffering from substance abuse. Often such persons are covered for 91 days in a five-year period. Depending on the insurance plan, patients who see mental health teams on an outpatient basis receive limited cover for outpatient expenses. For example, if an initial consultation fee to see a psychiatrist is €180, the patient may receive a refund of €60. Naturally, the crisis in child and adolescent mental health services is masked by this dependence on private care. If we are serious about seeing parity between physical and mental health, we need to drastically improve out-of-hospital mental health care services. Inpatient care is, by its nature, unsuitable to deal with all cases of psychiatric distress. Research into outcomes for patients strongly favours community-based care to treat certain classes of depression and other less serious psychiatric illnesses. We have heard much over the years about a shift towards care in the community. With the further development of primary care centres, I am hopeful psychiatric care will become integral to everyday medicine at a local level. I alluded to the shortage of adult and child and adolescent psychiatrists and the fact that the HSE regularly advertised posts that were not filled. To tackle waiting times, we need to be more proactive in staff recruitment and retention. I could develop the point further, but I will leave it at that. I thank Deputy James Browne and look forward to serious engagement on the issue and enactment of the Bill.

I welcome the Bill. It is both important and timely and I commend Deputy James Browne on bringing it forward. It is warranted. For decades we have struggled to adequately finance and operate physical health services. As a result, mental health medical services have always been put to the back of the line. They have not received the priority or attention they so richly deserve. There is now an unacceptable situation throughout the State where many children and young people are experiencing mental health difficulties and not receiving the age-appropriate timely services or supports they badly need. This is impacting on them and also has consequences into adulthood. It also impacts on their families, communities and schools. We need to give it urgent attention. I am pleased the Bill suggests intervention in terms of equivalence and that nothing else is required. This includes specialist 24-hour psychiatric first responders who could be deployed with every ambulance dispatched, with psychiatric consultants and registrars being rostered over 24 hours in every emergency department. We have all heard of situations where young people with mental health difficulties are referred to emergency departments. It is a shocking and humiliating experience for any young person to encounter and must stop. We need specialists in place to deal with the problem. Community-based primary care services must, as a matter of course, engage specially trained psychiatric medics in GP services. A mental health condition should be treated by such services, with the same access to qualified medical practitioners as someone who presents with any other medical condition. Why should a mental health condition be treated differently? Mental health care will only attain parity with physical health care when both are co-located within easy access for any member of the public. The underlying premise is that any person at any given time may require mental health care. We need to break down barriers and de-stigmatise the area of mental health. I am keen to acknowledge the great work being done by many organisations throughout the State. Were it not for organisations such as Sosad Ireland, Jigsaw and Pieta House, we would be in even more serious difficulty.I hope that serious provision will be made in the upcoming budget for our mental health services this year.
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	371	It is good we are having this debate. We have had a debate on this issue in this House on numerous occasions during the past two years. It is healthy to have this debate. I understand Deputy Browne's Bill is largely aspirational. It has much merit. Ensuring there is parity between our physical and mental health is very important, but the reality is very different. Other Deputies have stated that 6% of our health budget is spent on mental health services but largely in Europe the expenditure on this sector is approximately 12%. Where there is a lack of funding, one finds a shortage of staff and that people fall through the cracks. I want to bring to the attention of the Minister and Members an article reported in the newspapers at the weekend, which I found extraordinary. The clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital stated that 26 ill patients are currently in prison and cannot get into the Central Mental Hospital. He stated that is completely detrimental to their mental health. They are a danger to themselves and to other people. He further stated that, under the laws of the land, he is almost in contempt of court for not meeting his obligations as the clinical director of the hospital. Unfortunately, it gets worse. There is capacity for ten extra patients in the Central Mental Hospital but it cannot fill vacancies due to the shortage of psychiatric nurses. That facility has cost a great deal of money but it cannot get staff. That is the crux of the issue. Retaining and recruiting staff, particularly psychiatric nurses, is extremely difficult. Psychiatric nurses are demoralised in some ways because of the state of the health service and they are feeling the pinch. It is extremely important to address the issue of the retention of staff. I am to blame at times for lambasting our mental health services. There are some extremely positive aspects in terms of the staff in those services and the voluntary bodies in the State but when we look deep down there are serious anomalies in the services. Last week's RTÉ programme "The Big Picture", which showed how young people are being failed by the State, would break one's heart. That failure is the result of austerity and lack of funding of our mental health services by successive Governments. We have seen the State fail people when they have sought services. The services fail them, they fall through the cracks and some people die because of that disgraceful situation. There is a shortage of staff. Another issue, which many speakers have raised, is our child and adolescent mental health services, CAHMS, which is in crisis. I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare. What it has found is damming of our health service. It found chronic staff shortages with staffing levels as low as 47.5% of what was recommended in some regions. The child and adolescent mental health services have only 56% of the number of staff who were meant to be employed. It is pretty bad. The social damage that does is incalculable and people die because of a lack of services. A Vision of Change, which I believe was introduced in 2007, was a very good document but like all documents that come into this House it never gets implemented. A Vision of Change is quite conservative regarding what the funding should be. It is 8.6% in the State but in line with European levels it should be double that. Until we tackle the chronic underfunding, particularly of our mental health services, we will have a constant crisis in our mental health services. I welcome the debate on this issue but until the Government tackles the danger posed by the lack of funding of our mental health services, we will continue to have this debate and people will continue to die.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	372	I welcome the introduction this Deputy James Browne's Private Members' Bill. An increase in the provision of mental health care in this country is urgent to say the least. We should be very careful about how this parity between physical and mental health proceeds and we should be especially careful about how we frame the discussion. It is important to be conscious of the fact that the term “mental illness” is a highly loaded and ideological one that takes away agency and certain types of possible treatment from a person. When one says someone is ill, one presumes to understand what a healthy person would look like. This is well and good for physical problems like diseases, and degenerative diseases, but if one applies this to the mind, then we are in very different territory. No one in the history of humankind has ever seen a mind, or been able to study one in anything resembling what we call the scientific method, and anyone who pretends to know what a healthy one looks like is not telling the truth. I do not have time to go into how over time the brain has become the realm of science and consciousness has been left to the philosophers but a number of major problems result from that ideology. One of them is drugs. Pharmaceutical drugs that are used to treat so-called mental illnesses are physical things and that means that they can only have a physical effect. If the mind of a distressed person is a purely physical thing and our mental distress is purely the result of a malfunctioning of a person’s material brain, then there is a possibility that these may work. That is, presuming that the manufacturers of these drugs understand the human brain and how all the different parts of it relate to all the different diagnosed illnesses. However, any neuroscientist who is honest would tell you that we do not have a clue how the brain works. Any one of us here knows from our life experience that the circumstances in our lives and in the lives of those who are routinely diagnosed with so-called mental illnesses are a major factor in people presenting with distress and mental health issues. These life experiences and how we react to them are not physical things. The drugs are only designed to alter how people perceive their lives, not change them. The problems that lead to someone having a breakdown are not solved by taking the drugs: the problems remain. People can bury immense trauma deep in their consciousness in order to survive and it can be triggered years, even decades, later in the form of what a psychologist would diagnose as a severe mental illness. The drugs will not help these people build the tools to cope in a world where that world has violated them in an unimaginable way - the grief will remain.  A second problem is related to the first in a profound way. Talking therapies are rarely used by the HSE. One reason for this is that psychologists are running the show and they do not see any scientific value in talking to people they diagnose as mentally ill, the problem being scientifically, a materially, brain-located one. Another is that there is no regulation of psychotherapy, a problem the Minister has said he is working on, but people should not hold their breath. The lack of regulation leads to an issue of insurance for the HSE, and only those educated in the art of denying the existence of human consciousness, with their PhDs from the highest institutes in the land, are a bankable proposition in this regard. A third problem is that it is costly and time consuming to talk to people, and if one listened to what they are saying it would undermine the dominant medicalised model of mental health care, which is so cosy with the pharmaceutical industry. If one presents to a general practitioner, GP, he or she has the power to prescribe very powerful drugs. Usually this prescription is based on a few questions about one's behaviour - is one anxious, has one trouble sleeping, has one negative thoughts and so on. The GP will not ask, nor is he or she qualified to ask, what has been going on in a person's life and how he or she might deal with that. What is more, a GP will commonly not tell a person about the side effects of these powerful drugs. The number of people committing suicide because of the reckless prescription of these drugs is a scary reality in Ireland and nothing is being done about it. At a meeting in New Ross just over a year ago, at which Independents 4 Change was presenting a submission on how to improve mental health provision, the executive clinical director for mental health services in community healthcare organisation area 5, CHO5, responding to a query as to why there were not more talking therapies provided by the HSE, told one of my staff that the mentally ill were not to be trusted, so there was no point, scientifically, in talking to them.If we are to increase funding to the mental health services in Ireland, powerful people in the HSE who hold such positions should not be part of the process. We need to wake up to the reality that many people who are in charge in the HSE mental health services would not last long if we stopped talking about mental illness and started to talk to people about what is going on in their lives. I have spoken in this Chamber on a number of occasions in the past while about five children who have presented with suicidal ideation in Wexford in the past year and a half. These are children, as young as seven years old and ten years old, and up to 14 years old, who want to kill themselves. Every one of these children has had to wait for over two years to access child psychiatry services. As I stated the last time I spoke here about suicide prevention services, I appreciate that not everyone presents with suicidal ideation and that it is, of course, not always possible to identify signs that someone might be suicidal, but from speaking to those trying to avail of mental health services in Wexford there seems to be an incredible lack of an emergency response to those who present with suicidal ideation. It is unforgivable. We have to take these threats seriously. We already know of very young children in Ireland who have committed suicide. I was contacted this week by yet another mother, the mother of an eight year old boy who also presented with suicidal ideation. It is not easy reading about her son. For parents who are experiencing this for the first time, the lack of services and the length of time they will have to wait for these services comes as a shock. Having had experience of dealing with other parents in the same situation previously, I know what the waiting times are like. I dread breaking the news to the parents who are dealing with this for the first time. This poor mother has only just realised that the waiting time for her son who has presented with suicidal ideation is two and a half years. What must it be like? What is even more infuriating is that in Wexford we have someone who many people believe to be one of the best child psychiatrists in the country, Dr. Kieran Moore, but children cannot get access to him because the waiting lists are so long. I have never met or spoken to Dr. Moore but I have spoken to a number of parents who speak incredibly highly of him, not just as a psychiatrist but as a human being who cares deeply about his patients and, I have been told, goes above and beyond for these children and parents. I recently received a letter from a woman in Wexford who said the recent suicides of two of her friends had spurred her to write to me. Suicide is an epidemic in Wexford. It is a remarkable letter. I would not mind showing it to the Minister, if I got the woman's permission. It is handwritten, and she lists 20 different individual significant problems with mental health services in Wexford. I have raised a number of these issues over time in here, but not all of them. The letter is a remarkably comprehensive and insightful list. In isolation, each problem she lists causes massive problems for people in Wexford but by listing all 20 problems together in her letter, she shows the overwhelming extent of the lack of mental health services in Wexford. As well as the list, she makes a perceptive observation, one that explains to some extent why parents in Wexford have not revolted. She states that many parents cannot advocate publicly because they are worn out just getting through each day keeping the children safe. We have an awful lot to answer for in this place. What is going on is too bad and I am sorry but it is not changing. It is getting worse in Wexford, not better, and all the talk in the world will not sort it. Our approach is wrong, there is not enough funding and one cannot blame the parents for feeling that the organisations and apparatuses that run this country just do not care enough because that is how they feel.

I am happy to make some brief comments on this Bill. Allow me, ar an chéad dul síos, to salute Deputy Browne for his commitment to the issue of mental health and the time and effort he and his staff have put into drafting this Bill. There is absolutely no parity between how physical and mental health are treated in this country. This Bill seeks to amend that. Indeed, Deputy Browne described it in the memorandum for the Bill, as follows:The neglect of Mental Health is a deep seated cultural issue at policy, institutional, organisational and individual levels. This Bill aims to offer hope and provide a catalyst for better Mental Health care by ensuring that vulnerable persons with mental illness are cared for effectively and equally. We also saw in the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare's second interim report, the launch of which I was privileged to attend in the AV room last week, that "[t]he lack of cohesion between primary care and mental health services often means that the most marginalised people are the most adversely affected in terms of accessing mental health services." That is telling. This is a very good report and I salute the committee, chaired by Senator Freeman. The interim report goes on to state that the HSE, at a meeting on 30 November 2017, confirmed to the joint committee that only 60% of the 114 community mental health teams in Ireland have a seven days a week service. It is appalling. What about the places that do not have it? Even the ones that have a seven days a week service, it is scant at times. Like other Deputies, I salute those working on the front line. The vast majority of psychiatrists and everybody else do a wonderful job. The report indicates that “[i]f these teams are really to be the bulwark of the service they were envisioned to be in A Vision for Change, Ireland should be working towards a situation where supports are available seven days a week and 24 hours a day...". They should at least have that. Tragically, this is clear in my own constituency where we have children and young adults languishing in paediatric wards for months without any access to appropriate levels of care. At present, there are two languishing there. One, a girl of 14, is waiting 11 weeks and she is from County Waterford, Deputy Butler's constituency, but my parish. Another girl is six and a half. Imagine that girl is in her 11th week. It will be 12 weeks come the weekend. This is scandalous. I raised the matter last week in a Topical Issue debate and instead of receiving clarity about what will be done, I received a dry official reply about how wonderful the funding levels are. There is nothing more insulting than that when we all know of the horror and the trauma. It was pathetic. In the meantime, the children suffer and their parents are driven to their wits end. That clearly demonstrates the need for a Bill of this type and I compliment Deputy Browne on bringing it forward. The situation is just not good enough. One of these girls who is taking up a bed in the children's ward is 14 years of age and is almost an adult. However, there are eight beds lying idle in Éist Linn in Cork because of bad management, mismanagement and stubbornness by the management. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to try to make some effort.
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	I am happy to speak on this Bill and I thank Deputy Browne for bring it forward, as I believe mental health is an area in Ireland that has been neglected. According to the Healthy Ireland survey 2015, 10% of the Irish population over the age of 15 have a probable mental health problem at any one time. Everyone has somebody in his or her life who has an issue with mental health, whether it be depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol issues or drug issues. Approximately 6% of the overall health budget is spent on mental health each year, which is totally inadequate and needs to be changed. The Government needs to fully realise its commitments to mental health and adequately invest in mental health and update current legislation in order to improve the mental health outcomes of adults and children living in Ireland. I am hearing from my constituents about a number of issues around mental health. Many families tell us horrific stories when dealing with child and adolescent mental health issues. There are only 69 child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams when it is recognised we need 95 such teams to adequately cover the country. Many of the child and adolescent mental health teams are inadequately resourced and as a result, the patients and families are suffering. It is vital that we have early intervention but, unfortunately, this is not always the case. The health service has stated that emergency response times to child and adolescent mental health issues should not be greater than 72 hours. We need 24 hours seven days a week access to our mental health services. The issue of children and adolescents being admitted into adult mental health facilities is totally unacceptable and needs to be addressed. According to United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, UNICEF, difficulties in accessing the mental health services and closure of beds are adding to the seriousness of Ireland's teenage mental health issues.The UNICEF report states that Ireland's teenage suicide rate is the fourth highest among high earning countries. We need considerably more supports and treatment centres for people suffering from eating disorders. Some people suffering from eating disorders are being admitted into adult psychiatric hospitals due to the lack of specialised units. Supports for people with postnatal depression need to be improved. While I accept some improvements have taken place, a lot more needs to be done. I acknowledge the great work being done by self-help and advocacy groups across the country, such as Lisheens House in Skibbereen. The Men's Sheds Association is a good initiative. Organisations such as Pieta House are doing outstanding work. Without organisations such as Pieta House, our mental health service would be in a much worse position. People suffering from mental health issues can no longer be seen as objects. They must be involved in a meaningful way in making decisions about their treatment and care and in any legislation that seeks to increase the standards of mental health care in Ireland.

The Deputy is right that we are not giving treatment to people who present with mental health issues comparable with the treatment given to people who present with physical or other health issues. I will talk about Kerry. To go back in time, there were 1,200 patients in St. Finan's mental institution. There were many people in there who should not have been there. There were people in there who needed treatment. We have gone from that figure down to very few in our county. Young people presenting with mental health issues are not able to get one-to-one treatment which they need 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I know of a family that lost its lovely 23 year old son. He told his parents that he had problems and issues. I will not say where he was taken but he did not get treatment and he is, sadly, no longer with us. His family is heartbroken. There is a vacant chair at the table and he will never sit in it again. He was very good. He told them all he had a problem but he did not get the help he needed. There are many other cases like that. We do not have enough to deal with them. It is a serious issue. There are only hours in it. Some people who were seen are fine. They are living and are with us today. I thank Denis and Marie O'Carroll in Killarney who lost their son Nathan 11 years ago. They started the Darkness into Light walk every year. It has been done since then and we will be doing it again this year. I thank those in Pieta House for the help and work they do and the other people who volunteer around Killarney and Tralee and elsewhere around our county who are trying to help people who present with mental health issues. We need more assistance from the HSE. It needs to be recognised more by the Department of Health. What Deputy Browne is asking for should be acceded to. Another issue is that when young fellows or young girls who were getting treatment or help from doctors have to leave the treatment because they turn 18, the do not get the continuity of service they received until they were 18. There is something wrong with this because they are still very young at 18 and 19 years of age and they should be getting the same treatment.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	377	While the principle of the Bill is one I wholeheartedly support, it represents only a starting point. I think that is generally accepted. The experience in the UK shows that similar legislation, while having a positive effect on the provision of mental health services, is by no means a panacea. The 2012 Health and Social Care Act in the UK enshrined in law parity of esteem for mental health and is defined as valuing mental health equally with physical health. Despite being a central plank of NHS policy for six years now, serious issues remain with mental health services in the UK. It is a system that, even when parity was introduced in 2012, was years ahead of our own in terms of service delivery and treatment provision. While the concept has merit, it is not a silver bullet. We all know what is needed to fix out mental health services - funding, a reform plan and the political will to deliver on both of those. The absence of these things has hampered the effective implementation of A Vision for Change almost since it was first published. This is partially due to economic circumstances and partially due to the political decisions that were made as a response to those circumstances. The slashing of mental health funding during this period, aside from being wholly unjust, was a classic example of short termism. Individuals who would have benefited from earlier interventions to address mental health issues at the lowest level of complexity were abandoned or offered inappropriate pharmaceutical treatments in the absence of any kind of talk therapy. We simply do not know the impact it will have in the future and it is likely that it is having an impact now. Studies have shown that later, more complex interventions for mental health illness are less effective and more costly. Long-term planning and not panicked crisis-to-crisis reaction is the truly transformative measure that has been sorely missing from not only our mental health services but our health services in general. The implementation of the Sláintecare report would represent a grounded first step towards achieving parity for mental health. The 2018 budget for mental health services is €917.8 million, 6.3% of total health spending. This is below the level advised in A Vision for Change and compares very badly with similar states. A Vision for Change recommended it should be over 8%. The Sláintecare report recommended as an initial target 10% of the overall health budget being ring-fenced for mental health services. A Vision for Change recommended well-trained, fully staffed, community-based, multidisciplinary mental health teams be rolled out across the community health areas. The report also detailed the additional staffing requirements for these teams. Indicative funding needed to deliver on this amounts to just over €120 million, adjusted for population growth. The Sláintecare report recommends this funding be phased in over five years. This includes funding for child and adult mental health teams, child and adolescent liaison, old age psychiatry and mental health services for people with intellectual disabilities. People with medical cards can avail of counselling through referring clinicians. This is a new service which 9,374 people utilised in 2016. For this service to be extended to the whole population, a budget increase is needed over time. Given the limited availability of talk therapies and community mental health teams, extending counselling in primary care would represent a way to address mental health needs at a lower level of complexity and in a much more effective way. The Sláintecare report recommends the provision of universal access to six to eight counselling sessions for those whom their GP determines are in need of this service. The allocation for this service in 2016 was €6.5 million. The report recommends doubling this spend over a three-year period. A further allocation of €5 million would allow additional psychologists to be hired as part of primary care services to work with people who do not need a referral to community mental health teams. The Sláintecare plan offers the only grounded and achievable roadmap for achieving the transformation in our mental health services which is badly needed and which would allow us to reach the minimum level of care that was promised 12 years ago in A Vision for Change. We can only hope the Government does not allow to slip through its fingers this once-in-a-generation chance for real reform of our mental health services and an achievable way of ensuring parity for mental health. We must act on implementing Sláintecare as a matter of urgency.

I compliment Deputy Browne on bringing it forward and I confirm my support for the Bill. The Bill represents another step in the journey to bring mental health into the heart of the community and give it equal status with physical health. When I think of the journey of institutional care to the centrality of community-based services I think of my late dad, who worked as a psychiatric nurse at St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel for over 40 years. He joined the staff in 1932 as a warder - there were no psychiatric nurses then. Although he was always a very gentle and compassionate man, the emphasis in the work at the time was on physicality and patient restraint. In his early days, St. Luke's had little or no contact with the outside world. There were locked main gates controlled by gate lodges, 8 ft high walls and locked wards but his generation of work colleagues quickly became qualified psychiatric nurses and began the journey to create a humane service. They tore down the walls, did away with the gate lodges and the locked gates and invited local people in to integrate the hospital and its patients into the local community. They did Trojan work and they came a long way but a lot more needs to be done. The challenge now is to make mental health services truly community-based and able to provide an immediate response to persons experiencing mental health difficulties in the same way as we have now for people with physical health difficulties. The key to this is to resource and fund mental health properly. For too long it has been the Cinderella of the service. We need a proper out-of-hours service, 24-7 crisis intervention teams providing rapid assessment and a comprehensive primary care counselling service. We also need to staff our community-based teams and the child and adolescent mental health teams fully. It is also vitally important to resource and support community organisations which do tremendous work across the country. In my area there is the River Suir Suicide Patrol, TaxiWatch and the C-Saw community suicide awareness workers. They are all volunteers but they work tremendously long hours on an ongoing basis in support of persons with mental difficulties. Talk therapies are important in this journey to truly community-based mental health services whereby we can react immediately to persons with difficulties.

It is a shame the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, could not make time to be here for the entire debate because it is a very serious matter. There are not many debates about mental health in the House, or on legislation specific to it, so he could have cleared the diary if the inclination was there. Whether it is his own fault or that of his diary secretary, it does not augur well for the approach of this House to this very important area. I fully support the Bill put forward by my colleague, Deputy James Browne. It brings us in line with international best practice as regards parity, as is seen in our nearest neighbours. It ensures that mental health is central to health issues. Sadly, over the years, mental health has consistently been the poor relation and we have seen scandals of various descriptions at different times. There have been a few flashes of spin-managed celebrations by Governments but A Vision for Change, which all parties have bought into over the years, cannot celebrate its successes because less than 50% of it has been implemented, despite the fact that we are at or around the 12th birthday of the initiative. In my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim North, and in south Donegal and north Roscommon, as Deputies Scanlon, McLoughlin and Martin Kenny will verify, we have a shambles of a service, notwithstanding the very hardworking professionals in it. The national staff numbers are 600 down on what they should be for an adequate service and for us to do what we are supposed to be doing. Our clinics are inundated with people of every party, colour and creed, desperately trying to get a child assessed, sometimes just for a follow-up on ongoing medication to ascertain whether it is necessary for them to continue to have the prescribed dosage of what are often very heavy medications. In some instances they may need to be increased but in many more they need to be decreased and it is arguable that children are being badly affected by this. Our health system generally, although it is populated by many hardworking professionals, is packed with managers, administrators and so on but is absent of leaders and this is underpinned by this week's crisis. I hope the Minister will take some of these issues on board.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	380	I compliment Deputy James Browne on introducing this Bill which will ensure that mental health is to the forefront of key decisions being made by the Department of Health. The Mental Health Parity Bill will see mental health well-being treated the same as physical health and we believe there should be parity of esteem. I will focus on the number of children who present with mental health difficulties but for whom, unfortunately, the correct facility for their needs is not available and the only option in some cases is in an adult facility. The latest batch of inspection reports from the Mental Health Commission in March shows that children were admitted to the acute psychiatric units at UHL, the centre for mental health care and recovery at Bantry General Hospital, the Lakeview Unit, Naas General Hospital and the Aisling Centre in Dublin. The department of psychiatry in University Hospital Waterford and Drogheda hospital's department of psychiatry also admitted children. None of these facilities has age-appropriate facilities and they are not suitable for children. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, has left the House but I want to put on record the assistance and support I have received from him recently on these issues. I see, at first hand, his own frustration with the current system and with minors being in adult facilities. A Vision for Change mental health strategy, published in 2006, outlined that Ireland would need 100 inpatient mental health beds for children and adolescents to meet patient demand. The national numbers for operational psychiatric beds for children and teenagers as of November 2017 stood at 68, though I am open to correction on this. There are four CAMHS acute admission units in Ireland with a maximum capacity of 76 beds but only 68 beds for every single minor in Ireland with a psychiatric need. In recent weeks we have seen the failure of the system to deal with the demands being placed on it and, last week, RTÉ exposed the serious gaps in our child and adolescent mental health service, in a special programme "Young and Troubled" which focused on children and mental health services for the young. The stories were heartbreaking but for many families these experiences are all too familiar as the standard of care children receive can depend on where they live.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	I thank Deputy James Browne for bringing forward this Bill in the area of mental health, which is so important to so many of us. The whole service for mental health is simply not being delivered, despite the funding that has been put into it, and a number of speakers have illustrated this quite eloquently.I recently debated a Topical Issues matter with the Minister related to the Kildare North service, where, as recently as last Christmas, a man with mental health issues showed up and was told to go away as the service could do nothing for him. Prior to that, a child on suicide watch who had been allowed to move from A to B without supervision went missing for over five days on two occasions. There are many examples where services are not in place. When I met the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, last July, I told him about a good service in operation in Celbridge known as the Abbey Community Project. It is a voluntary organisation with qualified, trained counsellors and psychiatrists that has been operating for ten years and deals with people with a dual diagnosis. The Minister said this model should be developed. For the past two years I have been dealing with the HSE, the Department of Health and the task force on the provision of funding for this organisation, but it has not received one cent. It operates on bucket collections. When its public liability insurance policy was due for renewal recently, everyone involved had to put in a few quid to pay for it. That is not balanced mental health services provision. The Abbey Community Project in Celbridge services much of north Kildare and has in excess of 90 cases. It receives referrals from the HSE, but it gets no State funding. The Minister said this model should be developed and supported, but for two years this organisation has not received one cent in funding. No one is giving it any support, good, bad or indifferent. How long can a voluntary organisation that is providing a service that is not being provided by the State continue to exist without support? It is shocking. The people reporting with mental health issues have nowhere to go. If we are to get real, we need to deliver. We need to put funding into the right services. Let us stop talking and provide the services needed.

The public health system is in crisis. Ireland's youth suicide rate is now the fourth highest in Europe. The inner workings of the HSE remain a mystery, with no accountability offered. The Bill places a duty on the Minister for Health to promote health parity and ensure all organisations within the health system meet parity obligations in mental health care. It is important to point out that there are amazing health professionals who are committed to helping, treating and comforting the most vulnerable in our society. Sadly, the system is failing both their efforts and the requirements of those whom they treat on a daily basis. We have all heard the accounts of those in suicidal crisis turning up at emergency departments only to be sent home, with a vague hope of receiving an appointment to see a mental health professional in the near future or, worse, with medication which could well become a drastic means to an end in the absence of specialist intervention. This cannot continue indefinitely. With due respect, no number of special Government committees can stem the steady tide of those who lose the will to live while waiting for a solution.  Services are way behind where they should be. The Government is simply not investing enough in them or supporting resources, as illustrated in the RTÉ "Prime Time Investigates" review of waiting times for adolescents who seek emergency help. The stories were heartbreaking. Sadly, many of us are hearing from people every day who find themselves in similar situations. There are those who cannot or simply will not speak out about their experiences.  There are also serious deficiencies in children's mental health services. I have spoken many times in the House about the child and adult mental health services, CAMHS, in the north west. I thank Ms Teresa Dykes and her staff for the work they do. There is no question but that this service has improved and that its waiting lists are getting shorter.  Fianna Fáil recently received data which show that at the end of January, there were 6,181 children waiting for a primary care psychology appointment, over one quarter of whom had been waiting more than one year, which is not good enough. If we want to help vulnerable children and young people in need of essential mental health services, the Government needs to take a lot more action. The State and the HSE have a duty to do better. It is crucial that every person be treated with dignity, fairness and respect, regardless of their mental health status.  In regard to people who present at doctors' surgeries, what we need is a 24-hour helpline through which GPs can access advice from mental health consultants because they do not know where to turn when families present with a young child with suicidal tendencies and so on. Such a helpline would be of valuable assistance.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	383	On behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and the Government, I thank Members for their contributions to this wide-ranging debate. This is an important debate which addresses our common desire to ensure the mental health service meets the highest international standards. There is no doubt that the subject of mental health, in all its aspects, rightly concerns all parties and Independent Deputies represented in the House. As such, when the particular mental health topic is legislation, it is only right and proper that all Members of the House be afforded the opportunity to have their say on how we should proceed in ensuring best practice in legislating in the area.  I thank Deputy James Browne for introducing the Bill. The area of mental health is one of the priorities of the Government and the Deputy’s ongoing work serves as a strong reminder that all stakeholders in the area want to ensure the issues are debated regularly. This point has been well made and is accepted on this side of the House. As alluded to by the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, there is extensive work under way in the Department of Health on far-reaching changes to mental health legislation, both in the short and medium term. This involves continuing work on the general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 on the basis of the comprehensive recommendations of the expert review group, as well as Private Members' Bills focusing on mental health. In addition, there is also a process under way to refresh A Vision for Change, the national mental health policy. The oversight committee responsible for this refresh is making significant progress and it is intended that it will have completed its work by the end of the year. We are also closely following the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health which is working to achieve cross-party agreement on the implementation of a single, long-term vision for mental health care and the direction of mental health policy in Ireland. We await with interest the publication of the committee’s final recommendations.  Additional funding in the order of approximately €200 million between 2012 and 2017 supported modernisation of mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and previous programme for Government commitments. A key focus has been the provision of additional posts to strengthen community mental health teams for adults and children. It has also been used to enhance specialist community mental health and forensic services, to increase access to counselling and psychotherapy and for suicide prevention initiatives. The Government is committed to continuing this trend of increased funding in the area as economic conditions allow.  The objective of placing physical and mental health on a par in legislation which is the stated aim of Deputy James Browne's Bill must be carefully considered to avoid unintended and undesired consequences. Without doubt, this poses challenges. Significant consultation will be necessary with all relevant stakeholders to ensure any new or amended health legislation will be effective in improving outcomes for citizens. In that regard, we should also investigate the experience in other jurisdictions in developing similar initiatives and learn lessons appropriate to our unique circumstances. We always need to be mindful of improvements in the way we attend to the mental health and welfare of citizens and amend or expand our legislation, as necessary. We also need to ensure that when the changes are made, they are the right changes and will have the intended effect. Most important, we need services to be accessible and without stigma. We need to encourage people to engage with services at the earliest opportunity and ensure the mental health service is attractive to those we want to work in it. We all accept that the service can and should improve, but in levelling unjustified criticisms we risk discouraging people who need those services from using them and those interested in working in services from applying for the many posts available.As I said, we already have several pieces of legislation relating to mental health currently under consideration, each of which is at a different stage of progression. When enacted we will monitor the beneficial effects of these legislative changes on the full landscape of mental health services provision and will be mindful of how this affects further proposed legislation in this area including this Bill. I assure the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and the Department of Health will review all the comments made this evening in the context of Deputy James Browne's Bill. These comments will be borne in mind as work progresses on our mental health legislation objectives and the delivery of health and personal social services.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	I commend Deputy James Browne on this Bill and on his huge efforts during the run-in to last year's budget to ensure a proper multiannual framework for budgeting. All of the work the Minister of State has spoken about with regard to legislation is coming from this side of the House, from the Opposition. The priority the Opposition has given, collectively, to pursuing mental health legislation and funding places in a very poor light the long-fingering we have seen again in the Minister of State's statement. Legislation such as Deputy Browne's Bill can only do so much. Ireland needs a complete change of culture and attitude. Can one imagine running emergency departments on a Monday to Friday nine-to-five basis? It would not be allowed to happen. This is, however, what we are doing with our emergency mental health services. We also need a change in the culture among our general population. One of the biggest examples of a culture change in environmental awareness, for example, has been the green flag programme in schools. Children at national school level have led the change - and the change in tone - around how we treat our environment in each household. I would like to see a similar programme introduced around mental health awareness at primary school level to equip teachers with the resources and the skills they need to be alert to the mental health of their pupils and to encourage children from an early age to talk about mental health in the same way we talk about physical health. The legislation can be put in place, the resources can be put in place, but we also need a change of culture so we treat mental illness in the same way we treat physical illness. When physical illness hits a family the meitheal goes around the family with the chain of supports. There are, however, often cases where the support does not come around when it involves mental health and people tend to stand back. This could change with programmes such as a school programme. The culture within Government also needs to change completely. The organisations that work in the area of mental health should be given the same priority in government and by the Government as this Opposition has given to them.

This is indicative of the crisis we are in with regard to recognising the issue. I commend Deputy James Browne's Bill for the equal status of mental health with physical health. I shall not go through all of the various recommendations in A Vision for Change and the various programmes that have been broadcast on RTÉ recently. Suffice to say Ireland has a dark history in the context of mental health and how we look after our young and old in that department. We need to end the discrimination and stigma of mental health illness to ensure that patients have access to quality healthcare and that equal resources are given to the mental health system as are given for physical health and well-being. It is absolutely shocking that there are cases where adults are being kept in prisons because there are no beds for them in the Central Mental Hospital. People with mental health problems are being failed by this Government and by successive Governments. Imagine what it is like for the families of those being treated in such a way. A physically ill patient would not be held in prison-like circumstances while waiting on a bed, so this should not happen to a person who has a mental illness. We are living in a first-world country where patients should expect a high level of healthcare for physical and mental health. The Bill will give a statutory basis to the acknowledgement that mental health is on parity with physical health. This parity of esteem will shift the mindsets of those who thought it acceptable to hold mentally ill patients in difficult circumstances, or those who think that a mental health illness is not as urgent or does not deserve the same level of care as a physical illness. I commend the Bill. From the figures we can see the reduction in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and a reduction in the availability of services. Sometimes it feels as though we are going backwards instead of forwards. I hope we can improve the situation for people who are suffering and their families.

Time and again persons with mental health difficulties are sidelined and made to feel that their plight comes secondary to those with physical health issues. It is both sad and embarrassing to have to admit that the real gravity of the mental health situation in Ireland is unknown because we are only aware of those suffering once they take the brave step to seek help. The purpose of the Bill is to introduce parity of esteem. This needs to be the new phrase when speaking about mental health. All aspects of health have to be addressed on an equal footing. Mental health should not be referred to as though it is a separate sector. For too long mental health organisations have been surviving on the remnants of the health budget once every other sector of the health service has been funded. This does not help waiting lists, which are currently unacceptable. Pieta House will host its tenth Darkness into Light event in ten days' time. More than 200,000 people will walk side by side in their communities to raise money to fund its brilliant services. People understand the necessity to have mental health normalised and treated as the serious health issue it is. Many of the amazing facilities, of which we are all aware, receive no funding from Government. There is a fantastic facility in West Cork called Lisheens House. I shall attend a meeting there tomorrow evening to discuss issues around rural isolation. The staff there have said that lack of knowledge is the biggest barrier for them. They are currently providing question, persuade and refer, QPR, training to 40 people. In addition, they have eight counsellors providing counselling in six locations in Cork and they have a helpline that is getting busier by the day. This service is all financed by local fundraising. They do not have money to advertise and the service relies on word of mouth. How can this be acceptable in the 21st century? We need to bring Ireland into line with international best standards and this Bill is a huge step in the right direction.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	389	The mental health area has suffered systemic neglect and lack of resources. If anybody is in any doubt about this they only need to see RTÉ's "The Big Picture" from last week. It is, unfortunately, truly reflective of what so many parents and patients throughout the State are experiencing with mental health services. The numbers are reflected in the percentage of funding that is spent on mental health out of the overall health spend. It is currently barely over 6%. A Vision for Change provides that it should be 8.4%. Sláintecare has said it should be 10%. The World Health Organization, WHO, recommends that the spend should be 12%. The confidence and supply agreement inserted a requirement that A Vision for Change would be funded over the lifetime of the Government. This was reflected in a proposed €35.4 million per year over each of five years. In budget 2017, however, when the €35 million was announced we found out subsequently that only €15 million could be spent in the following year. How this adds up is beyond me. We were then given an undertaking that in budget 2018 the baseline would include the original €35 million and an additional €35 million would be added. After the 2018 budget we discovered that this also was not the case. For budget 2019 we have had to get a signed undertaking that €55.4 million would, in fact, be available and that we could finally commence a multiannual budget. It is expected that this money will be there this year. I believe that this shortchange was led by the Department of Health and one wonders if any of the funding would be available today without the confidence and supply agreement. The WHO's definition of mental health was referred to. Why is this definition not included in Ireland's equality and employment legislation? Why has the legislation not been updated to include the definition if it is being relied upon by the Department of Health? Where is the Bill to implement the expert group review of the Mental Health Act 2001?Only one out of 165 recommendations has been implemented to date. Where is the Bill to give powers to the Mental Health Commission so that it can have powers equal to those of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to investigate 24-hour residential community care centres? Why was the role of the director of mental health removed by the HSE this year? Why has the number of referrals seen by child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, dropped by more than 2,000, from just over 12,000 to just over 10,000? All of this reflects the fact that mental health simply is not being given priority in the Department of Health. That was the catalyst to bringing forward this Bill. This Bill mimics and reflects similar legislation in the UK. There is little or no reason for the Government not to be able to enforce this legislation. The Minister of State seemed to imply there would be some sort of difficulty in doing so. It was flagged several months ago with the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and it is a pity that he is not here to hear the closing speeches. It was flagged with him several months ago so it was no surprise that this Bill was coming forward. I believe that the lack of parity for mental health is partly due to a deep-seated cultural issue at policy, institutional and organisational levels and at individual levels at the height of the Department of Health. It is seen as something other and something lesser within the Department and it is not given the priority that it deserves. The previous Fianna Fáil Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 that came through the Houses is now on Final Stage in the Seanad, having worked its entire way through the Dáil. I expect it will pass all Stages in the Oireachtas within the next two months. I intend to pursue this Bill with the same drive as that with which that Bill was pursued and I will not let it rest there. I commend this Bill to the House.

This amendment is to provide explicitly that members of a local authority are included in that paragraph. Concerns were raised on Committee Stage about the wording here. I said on the occasion that I felt that public officials were covered by way of a more general description in the Bill. I was satisfied that there was sufficient reference to local authority members in the previous wording. I accept what Deputies Ó Laoghaire and O'Callaghan had to say. I do not see any harm - in fact, I see merit - in clearly stating that this section applies to that category of officials, as suggested on the occasion by Deputies O'Callaghan and Ó Laoghaire. I hope that this amendment will assuage the Deputies' concerns as evidenced in the earlier part of the debate.

We will support it. As the Minister indicated, this is a proposal that we put forward on Committee Stage. I am now on a very technical reading of the Bill as it was drafted. When one looks at Schedule 1, under "Irish Public Bodies", in paragraph (j), there is a reference to "a local authority". However, I think because of history and the importance of local government in Ireland that it is appropriate that local authorities should be spelled out expressly in the interpretation section of the legislation. I welcome what the Minister has done.

It is fair to say that there have been issues in the past with corruption that have centred around local authorities. It is important to acknowledge that, similar to other public representatives and elected persons, we should identify members of local authorities specifically, and I thank the Minister for taking the point on board.

Irish public bodies, as we know, is an umbrella movement loosely representing all local authorities and operations of local government. It took some time for the Minister to accede to the request to have a separate mention for local authority members. It rings hollow because local authority members and local government have been decimated by the previous Government with all the attacks on and the banishment of local authorities as we knew them. In my county, there were five or six of them. It has happened to town, urban and district councils such as the borough council for Clonmel which used to be and may still be the biggest inland town in the country. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to hold a plebiscite to see if they could be reinstated, if the public wanted them, on a no-cost basis. I have not heard a word about it since the Minister closed the books that evening, almost two years ago now. There has not been a mention. The acceptance by the Minister of this amendment to the Bill is certainly welcome because in the times when I was a member of the local authority, I did not feel that Irish public bodies was that caring and nurturing of local authority members. One could get lost in the system and the whole cumbersome nature of IPB and its dealings with Government, Ministers and officialdom at a national level. It was a national organisation, as we all know, but sometimes it did not represent its members. It is important for any legislation to address any person who is elected to a local authority. Local authorities are now nearly a third of a Dáil constituency.They deserve to have their place rightly recognised but they have been stripped of most of their powers. They are nothing like they used to be. They were tighter districts before the amalgamation and everything else. That was certainly the case in Tipperary. As I stated, the councils are now nearly a third the size of constituencies. There are two towns in my local borough district: Cahir and Clonmel. There is a huge difference between them. Clonmel is a town of 20,000 people, while Cahir only has a population of 4,000. They each have different services and expectations of members. The Minister is making faces at me as if to say that I am rambling but I am not. Local authority members must be respected. They have been overloaded with huge districts, a lack of recognition and a lack of respect by many officials in many counties. A workshop is held behind closed doors before every meeting members attend to discuss matters. The manager must get what he or she wants and any member who does not agree with that will feel the brunt of it. Representation is very difficult. That is not what democracy is about. We must have respect for those put themselves forward and get elected. Many notable men and women served as councillors long before we were around. It was not about remuneration but, rather, public service. Fine Gael disbanded town councils. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to borough district councils. Many local authority members would like to go back and serve on the districts which were previously in place. They would do so without remuneration but, rather, just for the sake of having some say and coherence in the overall planning, running, maintenance and image of their town and district. A borough used to be only the town and its immediate environs, and its boundaries would extend less than a mile outside the town. Boroughs now extend 30 miles one way and 25 miles the other way. The images of many towns, and the towns themselves, have been completely diminished and they are suffering badly as a result. I welcome that on this Stage the Minister accepts that local authority members will be specifically mentioned in the Bill. They have been written out of too much legislation and that is happening more and more on a daily basis.

I am happy to have another opportunity to speak to the Bill. I spoke on it in November of last year. It is very important and addresses a variety of anti-corruption measures on national and international levels. The legislation is necessary to aid in the elimination of white collar crime. I wish to raise a matter that I have previously brought to the attention of the Minister. A constituent of mine from Skibbereen, County Cork, leased a mountain-top site in Dunmanway from Coillte, a State agency, in 1990 for the purpose of developing a wireless telecommunication system for west Cork and beyond. It was one of the most valuable sites in the area in terms of mobile telecommunication. However, the arrival of Esat Digifone and O2 to surrounding sites resulted in the matter ending up in the Circuit Court in July 2005, 15 years into a 25 year lease. The case is relevant to section 7 of the Bill, which deals with corruption in regard to office, employment, position or business. There were several court hearings on the matter and it is alleged that no registrar was present to swear in a witness, which is required by law under the Courts of Justice Act 1924. In spite of that, my constituent's case was heard and judgment found against him. The Cork Circuit Court office has since stated that a registrar was present but it was unable to provide any names or proof of claimed expenses by that registrar on the day in question. My constituent was denied his right to appeal because there was no registrar in court to record the content of the judge's findings on the day. As no registrar was present, the end result is that all Circuit Court appearances in the case are unconstitutional, null and void. This ongoing nightmare destroyed the man's business ambitions and family and the stress he suffered has contributed to the deterioration of his health. No one in the Courts Service has done anything to assist him after 20 years of presenting his case to the best of his honest ability. I wish to again ask the Minister if the Bill will provide any assistance to my constituent. When implemented, will the legislation allow him to appeal his case and have it re-examined as a result of the corrupt court proceedings? Will that man and many others like him receive justice for the white collar crime of which they have been the victim?

I thank the Deputies for their contributions. It would not be reasonable or fair of me to comment in detail on a case before the courts such as that raised by Deputy Michael Collins. I wish to impress upon Members the clarity of this rather simple amendment which provides for specific reference to members of local authorities.

I have only been to the university of life. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle today reminded Members that we still have a democracy and free speech, with his permission. Our contributions are as relevant as possible and speak to amendments that have been tabled. Deputy O'Callaghan suggested this amendment. I cannot remember the exact terminology used by the Minister but it sounded like he accepted it in desperation because he is afraid the confidence and supply pipe could erupt at any time. Ministers are four days away from the two-year mark and will be entitled to Government pensions and everything else on 6 May. Anything could happen next week. There could be an awful rupture in the pipe and a scattering to the hills. The Government would then be looking for a lot of water from the Shannon to quench the fires it has caused. I think the Minister was a local authority member, although I am not certain and could be wrong. The motto of his late father, God be good to him, was "Here comes Oliver and there goes Flanagan". Fair dues to him. I have pictures of him pedalling his bicycle around his constituency. At least the Minister has the satisfaction of having a car and driver. Those were difficult times but county councillors were respected. We are fortunate to have a wise man such as Deputy O'Callaghan to think of the country councillors, although his party has forgotten about most other things in rural Ireland and did not even oppose the banishment of local town councils by the former Minister, big Phil Hogan, the enforcer, when he destroyed local government.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	419	I move amendment No. 2:In page 17, lines 8 and 9, to delete “offered, given or agreed to be given, accepted, obtained or agreed to be accepted” and substitute “accepted or obtained”.Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, deal with the forfeiture penalty under section 17, which appears four times. Each of the amendments seeks to do the same thing to each subsection in which the forfeiture penalty appears. On Committee Stage I flagged that I might need to bring forward such an amendment. Members will be aware that under section 27(1) there are four penalty options for a court where a person is found guilty of the offence of trading in influence. The penalties are a fine, a term of imprisonment, the forfeiture of a gift, consideration or an advantage and a combination of one or more of these penalties. Amendment No. 2 is to section 17(1)(iii) which provides for the forfeiture penalty. The subsection states a court may order the forfeiture of any gift, consideration or advantage offered, given or agreed to be given, accepted, obtained or agreed to be accepted. Advice on the section has outlined that this provision, as worded, may be difficult to enforce. Ordering somebody to forfeit something he or she has already given to another person is not possible. The same applies to gifts, etc. agreed to be given or accepted. There is no guarantee that there is actually such a gift or that the person convicted has it in order to allow it to be forfeited. Amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, follow in the same vein in the penalties for other offences under the Bill. Essentially, what we are doing is ensuring a court may only order the forfeiture of a gift, an advantage or a consideration that the person being convicted actually holds. The amendments are technical in nature and I ask Deputies to give favourable consideration to the points mentioned.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	420	I will support the amendments. If a person receives a gift, a consideration or an advantage in return for an act of corruption, one of the penalties should be that that gift, consideration or advantage be seized. However, the way the legislation was drafted initially indicated that the gift could be seized if it had been offered or there had been an agreement to give it. In that situation, as the Minister said, the gift might not have been given. Therefore, if somebody was to offer to give somebody a sum of money and the money was not paid, it would be extremely difficult to seize the money from the individual since he or she had not received it. It makes much more sense to change the wording to "a gift, consideration or advantage which has been accepted or obtained". It introduces less ambiguity into the penalty section in section 17.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	421	I, too, support the amendment on the following grounds. I was to speak about something that hurt me greatly. The Minister will know that some of the finest people who ever served in local government were local councillors in terms of their dedication and commitment of time. He will also know that until 1999, there was no such thing as remuneration for being a county councillor; they were paid expenses. The late Danny Kissane - God be good to him - was a fine councillor for Fine Gael on Kerry County Council and I admired him a great deal. He reliably informed me that for the 12 months of 1981 the remuneration he had received for attending all his meetings and all of the time he had given to local government was £220. The point I am making is that we had respectable people like the late Danny Kissane and others from all parties - Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Fine Gael and others - as well as Independents. They were extremely dedicated to what I call their profession. They might have been small farmers, had a small shop or other job, but they were serving their communities. What hurt me badly - the Minister knows this as well as I do - was that as a result of the actions of a very small number of people, we had tribunals looking into payments made to politicians and so on. I do not want to brand places, but some of the cases happened to be in Dublin city. They gave what I would call highly respectable people a bad name. They also gave politics a bad name. However, people like the man I named were extremely dedicated and gave a lifetime to politics for no remuneration whatsoever. Speaking to the Bill-----

The amendment dealing with local authorities was passed. This amendment is about forfeiture.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	423	That is what I meant to say. This amendment is about the forfeiture of goods or gifts received and I have to outline my reason for supporting it. In the past that type of activity sullied and gave a bad name to respectable people who were serving their communities. They worked very hard to bring group water and local road improvement schemes to their areas. They tried to develop county development plans and local regional area plans and did all of the donkey work that had to be done in each area which, to this day, is being carried on by the highly respectable members not just in Kerry County Council but all other local authorities throughout the country. It is only right to recognise their work. It is important to acknowledge the time they gave and the work they did in their local authorities. I support the Minister's amendment because anything that will squeeze out that nonsense and those who blackguard the system is to be welcomed. At times, politicians got a bad name and it was due to the activities of a very small number of people. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a person steeped in local, national and European politics for many years, knows that being a politician can be a tough job at times. but we do it because we like it. However, we certainly do not like it when the idea of being a politician is sullied because of the activities of a very small number of people who lose track of what they are supposed to be doing and do things they are not supposed to do. I support the Minister and thank him for standing up for the good name of respectable politicians.

I refer the Deputy to page 17 of the Bill, lines 8 and 9. We are dealing with the penalties proposed. We have already dealt with the local authorities.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	427	I am aware of that and thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I support the amendment which reads: "In page 17, lines 8 and 9, to delete “offered, given or agreed to be given, accepted, obtained or agreed to be accepted” and substitute “accepted or obtained”. The Minister might think this is semantics and that I am playing with language and grammar, on which Teachta Jim O'Callaghan advised me a while ago, but it is very important that the wording be as tight and also as loose as possible to incorporate all of the aforesaid activities. On a few occasions it was certainly put in my way that if I were to do such a thing, I would be looked after. We have to stamp out that activity completely. There is no place for it in any modern democracy. The amendment is, therefore, necessary. I know that the legal advice was to change the longer wording to "accepted or obtained", but the problem with the high fliers involved in white collar crime or crime of this nature is they have the resources and the wherewithal to wheel in Deputy Jim O'Callaghan or one of his colleagues and send him to the building by the river where the matter can be held up forever.We saw what happened with the collapse of the economy, the banking inquiry and the court cases and the way they collapsed. This needs to be very tight and very stringent, with no tolerance for it. As Deputy Michael Healy Rae said, it was only cúpla duine, a small number of people who tarnished the reputation of the whole. It is fairly widespread in our economy and our country. The examples have been given here, including the scandal that we are dealing with at the moment. It is not corruption per se but it is a form of it in that there is no accountability. I just watched the "Six One News" and heard a certain gentleman refuse point blank to consider stepping aside when people have died. Many people have died and more people face death sentences. Why would corruption not be out there and be practised when people see that kind of disdain for democracy? We were here last week demanding that a Minister resign because he spoke to someone on the telephone but there is no demand for the resignation of the Minister who is championing and presiding over this horrible debacle involving cruelty and the suffering of so many women and their families, not to mention the dead women and their children and families. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might think I am straying from the matter before us but I am not. This is all giving the impression that certain people in the Government are untouchable and we have no way of getting them to resign. I called twice last night and twice today for the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to resign. He is in charge and the buck must stop somewhere. It stops with him at Government level and with the CEO of the HSE. They have to resign because it is just not good enough. In the context of this Bill, what kind of message are we sending to young people? Surely there must be some follow through, some bit of accountability and some engagement with the democratic process. If things like this happen, there must be accountability.  I have dealt with a lot of families who have been in terrible turmoil. Only yesterday a family received no protection from the courts and their house was repossessed by the law agents of this State, An Garda Síochána on behalf of KBC bank. Deputies Michael Healy Rae and Michael Collins and myself made representations that to bank six weeks ago but have not even had the dignity of an acknowledgement from the CEO who we requested to meet peacefully. We wrote several letters to that bank. When one compares one with the other, we need a lot of the words in this amendment, including "accepted or obtained". A lot of things were accepted and a lot of things were obtained during the so-called boom that destroyed our country. One thinks of the greed, giving, taking, obtaining, bullying, misuse and abuse of people.  In the final analysis, the right to homes Bill that we tried to bring in here did not get through and that is important in the context of what we are talking about with this subject. It is a murky subject. A former colleague and former Member of this House served time in prison on a charge of blackmail. He served his time and suffered the penalties of the law and had redress to court. It is important that it be for everyone. We cannot victimise politicians or others; it must be for everyone, without fear or favour. We cannot allow squeaky lines or, as with the banking inquiry, the shredding of files, of which the Minister is aware. Necessary files were shredded in the DPP's office in the middle of court cases and the cases collapsed. That is widely known but it is okay because they are the elite, for whom we are all paying. Our children, our children's children and our grandchildren's children will be paying back the debts to our so-called friends in Europe and the IMF.

This is about the words "accepted or obtained" in the amendment. There was a lot of accepting, a lot of obtaining and a lot of bullying and intimidation. A lot of lives were lost and trampled on and much suffering went on. It totally flies in the face of God, in the first place. It also flies in the face of accountability. That is what I am talking about - accountability in the banking and big developer sectors. It all got so cosy with the so-called Celtic tiger but he is lame and limp somewhere, if not deceased at this stage. The animal of NAMA was then set up and I am sure there will be a lot of inquiries when that is stood down. It is due to be stood down soon but a lot of funny things went on. A lot of bags of money travelled around my own town in Clonmel, as well as everything else.

“Amendment of Criminal Justice Act 1994
23. The Criminal Justice Act 1994 is amended—(a) in the definition of “realisable property” in section 3(1), by the substitution of the following for all the words from “but does not include property” to the end of that definition:“but does not include property which is the subject of a forfeiture order under—(i) section 30 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977,(ii) section 17 of the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018,or(iii) section 61 of this Act;”,(b) in paragraph (c) of section 12(3), by the insertion of “, section 17 of the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018” after “section 30 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977”, and(c) in Schedule 1A—(i) in Part 1—(I) by the deletion of paragraph 1, and(II) in paragraph 6, by the substitution of “paragraphs 2 to 5” for “paragraphs 1 to 5”,and(ii) in Part 2—(I) by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph 17:“17A. An offence under section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018.”,and(II) in paragraph 19, by the substitution of “16, 17 and 17A” for “16 and 17”.”.This amendment inserts a new section 23 into the Bill which amends the Criminal Justice Act 1994. Deputies will recall that in the course of the Committee Stage debate I stated that a further technical amendment to the 1994 Act might be necessary and here it is. The new section 23, paragraph (a) amends the definition of realisable property in the 1994 Act. That definition relates to property that is suspected to be linked to criminal activity. Realisable property under the Act can be frozen in contemplation of criminal proceedings. This would be the case so as to ensure that the person who holds the property is stopped from disposing of same until the conclusion of those criminal proceedings. This is done in anticipation of a confiscation order which, of course, would have the effect of depriving an individual of the benefit of any such property. That can be ordered once a conviction is secured. In light of advice received from the Office of the Attorney General and following extensive consideration, it is proposed to exclude any property that is forfeited under section 17 of the Bill from the definition of realisable property because forfeiture under section 17 is part of a criminal penalty and should be excluded from the civil freezing regime under the 1994 Act, as per paragraph (a). Paragraph (b) seeks to achieve a similar aim in that the property which is ordered to be forfeited under section 17 cannot be used in satisfaction of a confiscation order under the 1994 Act. Paragraph (c) is merely a restatement of an amendment which we already agreed on Committee Stage. I ask the Deputies for their indulgence and support of this amendment.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	437	It would be very neglectful of us in discussing this not to acknowledge and recognise the work that has been done by CAB for many years. If my memory serves me correctly, the Government of the day which was led by Fine Gael introduced legislation following the death of the journalist, Ms Veronica Guerin. Politicians at that time, both in government and in opposition, came together and passed the necessary urgent legislation which dealt with people who were involved in organised criminal gangs at that time who thought they could do whatever they liked and that they were above the laws of this State.They were running roughshod over the country at the time. They were laughing in the face of justice. During the discussion on this amendment, it is right and important to recognise a group of people who are working in a very stressful situation. I refer to the members of An Garda Síochána who work in the Criminal Assets Bureau and do our State a great service. They have to take over properties and possessions that have been deemed to be gained on foot of acts of criminality, including theft and corruption. The bureau resulted from urgent emergency legislation that was put together by the politicians of the time to give members of An Garda Síochána the extra powers they needed. They have done sterling work for our country and our communities. In recognising what happened at that time, I would like to mention the late Veronica Guerin and other people who were threatened and intimidated. I know some of them concentrated on this issue more than others. Virtually every week, the Sunday World is to the fore in the campaign against organised crime. I compliment the journalists in various newspapers who have worked in this field in the past and who are working in it at present. They are subject to a lot of worry at times just for doing their jobs. To be honest, we would not know about much of what goes on in this country only for the good work of journalists who dig deep to expose the criminal actions of people who are involved in highly organised crime. Some of those people have left this country to go to Spain and other parts of the world to enjoy their ill-gotten gains. Their actions have been brought to the attention of the public by journalists who are following in the footsteps of the late Veronica Guerin. During our debate on what the Minister is proposing in respect of section 17, it is right and proper for us not only to express our support for this proposal but also to recognise the work of the Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau. They have to be complimented and recognised on the floor of the House for the difficult work they are doing every day, sometimes in dealing with threatening and dangerous situations.

The penalty should fit the crime. It is a different story for parents whose children are being born today at a time when drugs are available around our country. As they bring up their children, they have to face the scourge of drugs that are readily available in our towns and, in some cases, although I do not wish to name any places, in our villages. It has gone down to that. If we can break down these devils and demons by confiscating their property, that is to be applauded and supported. Given that it is necessary to provide social housing to people who do not have a roof over their heads and may never be able to put a roof over their heads, I suggest that buildings which are confiscated under this legislation should be turned over to local authorities for use as social housing. That would penalise individuals who are involved in criminality while at the same time helping people who need social housing. I will be supporting this worthy amendment.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	439	As the Minister has said, he is proposing a new section 23 which will amend the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The 1994 Act and other Acts were badly needed to keep up with the activities of well-organised and highly trained criminals who had resources oozing out of them and had overseas links on several countries and continents. Like the previous speakers, I praise the brave officers who put their lives at risk when the Criminal Assets Bureau was set up. They did this to try to have some impact on guys who were dancing around the Garda Síochána and the courts, who knew the law as well as Deputy O'Callaghan knows it and who had lawyers at their disposal to find loopholes and to challenge every court from the Circuit Court to the High Court and the Supreme Court. We even set up a new court system to deal with them. I salute the brave members of the Judiciary who had to sit in those courts. As we know, there had to be non-jury trials during times of war for good reason. These trials were not easy because of the intimidation that went on and the fear factor that existed. Gardaí were followed to their homes by people who wanted to know where their families lived. All of this was very subtle, but it was not very nice. I assure the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and his officials that I consider the proposed new section to be highly commendable. It is supported by the Opposition party with which the Government has a confidence and supply agreement and by other Members as well. Subsection (a) provides for realisable property to be frozen in criminal proceedings to be procured and disposed of after a conviction has been secured. Of course the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven has to be a flagship in any debate on these issues. It must be recognised and acknowledged. We are talking about experienced and dangerous criminals who have significant resources, money and networks. It is frightening that a few people who are controlling the drugs situation in towns in my constituency of Tipperary are using children as young as eight years of age to do their drug runs. Property must be seized. This amendment will give the tools of the trade to An Garda Síochána, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the justice system so that these assets can be frozen until the appropriate time comes. We saw a notable case on the television at an early stage. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae mentioned a brave journalist, Veronica Guerin. Many other brave journalists write about these issues. I must compliment those involved with "Prime Time Investigates" as well for their bravery. These people do not like to be messed with or to have questions asked of them. They do not like to be knocked off their perch in any way. They want free rein. They want to be able to do what they wish with who they wish. The Minister and his predecessor have met a group in Tipperary that is trying to save local communities that are close to where people get on and come off motorways. The road network allows criminals to be in Tipperary in an hour and a half from the capital or wherever else. It is a question of high visibility. I know the Minister is making an effort to give An Garda Síochána more powerful vehicles and air support, etc. It is needed because our police officers are brave. Goodness knows they have been dragged into disrepute over so many inquiries, whistleblowers and God knows what. Such matters have to be dealt with too. We must never forget the ordinary men and women who are on the beat as gardaí. We must remember our very good detectives as well. As I always say, they cannot do anything without the support of the public. It is very important for the public to support them. I welcome this amendment.It deals with the freezing of assets and the sending of the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions to back up the charges when people are arrested and arraigned. The charges must then be proved and an eminent justice must sign it. These people would have very valuable assets in many cases. Some gardaí have shown me the pictures and videos after they visited some of those people and the homes were palatial. All of it came from the proceeds of misery visited on ordinary people, including torture, intimidation and abuse. These are crimes against a person, which should be the worst of all. I know there are many Acts on the Statute Book to deal with crimes against a person but we had to get real. This is getting real. When the Bill leaves the House tonight, how long will it take before its provisions are implemented? Will there be some kind of assessment? Many pieces of legislation are passed here and there are never impact assessments of the ones we oppose. There should certainly be examination of how legislation beds in, whether it functions and if there are unintended consequences. I hope there will not be any but there should be tracking of loopholes that might be challenged in the courts. There should be a period for settling in before coming back to matters like this. We are down to semantics, grammar and words. An order can be frozen while the conviction is being processed through all stages of the courts, and if there is a conviction, the property may be seized, secured and sold. The purchaser should not be intimidated, as that is also a major issue. There may be subtle messages that people should keep away or the property is a no-go area, so we must deal with such a practice as well. It is a sensitive, tricky and cagey business so we must be twice as cagey as those people. They get up early in the morning because they do not go to bed at night. When the ordinary working man tries to rest, they are prowling on the streets of towns and elsewhere, seeing who they can prey on next. The busy person pays taxes and works, whether as a working man or business man. I support the amendment.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	440	I move amendment No. 7:In page 23, after line 34, to insert the following:
“Amendment of section 6 of Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010
26. Section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 is amended by— (a) the substitution of the following definition for the definition of "criminal conduct":" 'criminal conduct’ means— (a) conduct that constitutes an offence,(b) conduct occurring in a place outside the State that constitutes an offence under the law of the place and would constitute an offence if it were to occur in the State, or(c) conduct occurring in a place outside the State that would constitute an offence under section 5(1) or 6(1) of the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 if it were to occur in the State and the person or official, as the case may be, concerned doing the act, or making the omission, concerned in relation to his or her office, employment, position or business is a foreign official within the meaning of that Act;".".This deals with an outstanding recommendation made by the OECD to Ireland in the course of its third round evaluation. The amendment changes the definition of criminal conduct in the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, which deals with the offence of laundering the proceeds of criminal conduct. Members will recall that the OECD recommended that Ireland should remove the dual criminality requirement in respect of bribery of a foreign official as a predicate to money laundering where an offence of bribery took place abroad. The amendment will give effect to this recommendation by inserting paragraph (c) in the above amendment, providing that criminal conduct includes conduct occurring outside the State under sections 5(1) and 6(1) of this Bill that involves a foreign official as defined under this Bill. There is no requirement that the conduct is an offence in the place where it occurs.

Properties were purchased in this respect. I must be careful how I describe these activities because I do not want to name particular cases. Activities were undertaken by officials in other countries who knew the funds involved were ill-gotten gains but they chose to turn a blind eye to that. It was a wrong-doing in itself but it could not be punished by this State in any way. There was no possible downside for the people involved because we had no jurisdiction in the matters. This is catering for that "loophole" of such cases that occurred in the past. People using funds in the way they did in those specific cases has resulted in the Minister's proposal this evening, and I hope this goes a long way to ensuring such activity does not happen again. Perhaps the Minister heard of, or did some fettering of an animal in the past, and this is the same type of thing. The Minister will fetter criminals, not by tying their hands or legs but rather by ensuring they are not free as they have been in the past. To be honest, the criminals were beating the system here and abroad. They had the best of legal people whom they could hire and they could get the best advice on how to use ill-gotten goods to buy properties and invest in businesses, as many of them did abroad. They were involved in different types of hotels and bars in warmer climates than here. In that way, they were able to launder their ill-gotten gains. They could take it from here and buy a business over there, so the money they made over there appeared to be legitimate. Officials working abroad were part and parcel of that system. I could compare that system to some of the activity going on here now that we have discussed in this Chamber on other nights relating to very questionable insurance claims. The system existed between professional people here and professional people abroad who used the money. This amendment puts the squeeze on and ensures such a practice cannot happen in future. Money is no good to these people unless they can use it. Their ill-gotten gains are no use unless the money can be laundered. They are doing it by buying property and especially businesses, including rental properties or restaurants and similar activity. In the 1980s and 1990s such people bought club venues here, particularly in Dublin, in order to legitimise their money. I compliment the Revenue Commissioners on their efforts to put a squeeze on the ill-gotten gains of crime. They did their job and should be complimented on that. Some people paid a very high price as they were terrorised by criminals who targeted them for only doing their job. When the heat got too much for these criminals in Dublin and around the country, they decided to take their money abroad, and that is why what is being discussed by the Minister is so important. If it makes it easier to punish people assisting that type of illegal activity outside the country, it is to be welcomed. That is why I support the Minister's statement. I thank him and his officials for the amendment. It has taken much work to pull this together as the Department had to account not just for our jurisdiction but others as well. Much time, consideration and research had to go into the process. The Minister only has so much time to do what he does. Much official expertise had to be used in drafting the amendments. I am sure it was tedious work and it was not easy.It was not easy for them to do. I recognise that and thank them all for doing their work.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	443	I have things to say myself without adding to that. I welcome this as well. I have great respect for the OECD. We do not listen to it often enough. It is an independent advisory body. It has done a series of evaluations. This is the third report. There is talk of setting up inquires here. Given the number of tribunals we have here, it would be better to bring in people from abroad who have no connection. They would provide independence and clarity. I put my own hand up. We might often be too close to issues to be able to see what is wrong. This is very important. I refer to criminal conduct and laundering the proceeds. That happened for a long time in sa tir seo, na hÉireann. They had so much proceeds they had to find useful work for wilful gain. They could not mention the way that they had got it. They sent scouts out and linked up with European and then international gangs. They were able to transfer funds by various means. Sometimes it was just carried in bags but at other times it was transferred by electronic transfer. A web of deceit operated by bankers could transfer money from account to account and move it here and there. Lots of property was bought out of their ill-gotten gains. I salute the journalists that investigated it. I also salute the members of An Garda Síochána, Interpol and other police forces. We must always recognise the support of Interpol and other police forces that have to painstakingly follow and untangle this web. The proceeds of crime must be gotten. Section 5(1) and section 6(1) in respect of foreign officials are necessary as well. That was a trick because the powers were not there under our legislation to follow these criminals and follow their tangled web of deceit. There were no powers to ensure they were monitored, were under covert surveillance and were identified and to ensure a case would be made to lead to arrests and questioning. The dual offence for crimes that took place abroad is very important. Otherwise we were going nowhere. I congratulate the Minister, his drafters and his advisers on this excellent legislation. We could see the wealth, the villas, the hotels and the palatial mansions on the sunny beaches of other countries. They had a lovely life of luxury after the misery that their empire perpetrated on the people of Ireland and, indeed, many other countries. It is important that we support this. When wrapping up, the Minister might indicate when this will be implemented and when he thinks there might be an evaluation of it. It is more difficult when it is offshore and off-site because we do not know what continent they have gone to. We have a massive coastline to patrol, as well as our airports. We have to cater for all kinds of movements. I welcome this legislation and hope it is introduced speedily and that it will be of benefit. We should go back to the OECD and ask it to evaluate it again for us. I know it is not altogether happy with some issues. I refer to the situation with white collar crime and the issues I spoke about on previous amendments about the banking inquiry. It is not very happy with some of the investigations and some of the roles of our police force. The OECD had things to say that we need to learn from. We need to talk to the OECD. Perhaps it could help us find a new Garda Commissioner. Perhaps we need international experience and people who have experience in police forces that have dealt with these issues in the countries they are from. The OECD is a valuable resource to have and we should listen to it. We must engage with it and be thankful for the advice it has given, especially in respect of this amendment. I am glad have accepted it. We can often become insular and say we know best ourselves. However, we often do not. I refer to the cold calm eye of an outside body like the OECD and such bodies that are not for profit and are for the betterment of developed countries and countries that are trying to develop. This is excellent legislation and I support anything we can do to curtail or restrict the salubrious lifestyles of the people who emigrate and tarnish and sully the name of this little nation. They laugh all the way to the bank, to their villas, to the seaside and to their fine wines because I am reliably informed that some have their own vineyards. They have a great lifestyle from their ill-gotten gains. They are into catering, hotels and all kinds of activities as a cover. It is not work. They do not work. They just want to bury and hide the proceeds of crime. They have a very salubrious lifestyle from a trail of misery and destruction left in our country. It is important that Interpol and all the other police forces around the world act on advice given by the OECD. They must work with our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We must try together - in aghaidh cur le chéile - to make a dent and bring down those empires of drug cartels and of deceitfulness. I refer to the image they portray to our young people of being above the law and that they can do whatever they like when they like with whom they like.

It is innovative because it seeks to amend our money laundering legislation to include in its definition of criminal conduct acts of corruption which we have established under this legislation have been carried out by foreign officials. In particular, it seeks to identify criminal conduct as including the criminal offence of active and passive corruption under section 5. Section 6 deals with active and passive trade in influence. It is innovative because it seeks to include those two criminal offences as examples of criminal conduct that can allow the operation of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. It is important to recognise that corruption is an international issue. If we look at examples of major international corruption, there are countries where one would start and one is not Ireland. There are countries where one would say that individuals involved in government have been, and are, involved in acts of corruption. The definition of "foreign official" in this legislation includes a member of the government of any other state, a member of a parliament of any other state and a public prosecutor in any other state. If we are serious about trying to tackle corruption, we need to ensure that we recognise its international context. The benefit of this amendment is that it will mean that the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 will be able to operate in respect of the offences contained in sections 5 and 6. This is far-reaching legislation. Our money laundering and terrorist financing legislation can be used to freeze moneys that happen to end up in Irish bank accounts if it can be established that those moneys are the proceeds of crime committed under sections 5 and 6 of this legislation. That is irrespective of whether or not those crimes are crimes in the country where the foreign official comes from.I believe it is an innovative proposal in this regard. We will be supporting it and I am interested in seeing how it will work out and the extent to which it will have an impact on deterring corrupt foreign officials from using Ireland as a place where they can source their money.

They were giving us the two fingers from abroad and doing practically whatever they liked. They took the view that they were untouchable in certain countries. I am unsure how far this will extend or whether those in other countries can still evade our laws and operate criminal rackets from afar. This is important. There are drugs coming in around our shores. We must congratulate the Garda on the great work done and for much of the apprehending of people caught bringing drugs. People are serving time in many cases. However, the problem remains because of the people who put drivers into lorries or who have people take the drugs or whatever. The real managers and bosses are still evading conviction in this country because the law was not good enough to deal with them. I hope this amendment will deal with these people. It hurts me when I see young people who started out well in life but lost their way because of drugs being readily available. Perhaps when their defences were down a little they started using drugs. These monsters or predators enticed such people into what I would call a desperate disease whereby they developed a craving for drugs. Not alone does it upset the person concerned, it upsets partners, children, fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. It brings them to a new kind of low that they thought they would never encounter in their families. When one person in the family is affected, it affects the rest of the family as well as friends and members of small communities. I support the amendment. I am supportive of any way that we can deal with these villains in a stronger fashion.

The members of the Rural Independent Group are supportive of this. Any right-thinking Member or person would be supportive of it. As I said, several enactments are being amended, some of which are rather old. The criminal justice legislation is only from this year but this Bill is also relevant to section 30 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. I was only doing my leaving certificate in school at that time. It is important that some of the legislation is updated and upgraded, especially when we are dealing with a situation of international crime gangs and money laundering and all that goes with it. The Criminal Justice Act 1994 is amended as well. It is important that we put them all together and have a workable document. It is important to provide clarity for our police service - the Garda Síochána in this case - and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. They need to be able to understand clearly rather than playing hide-and-seek with these marauding terrorists. They are terrorists. I know terrorism has been used in a different vein today - something I very much resent, but we will deal with that in the next session. This is terrorism because people are the victims of all these heinous crimes in their homes. They are literally terrorised in their homes, businesses and communities, whether they are at work or play. It is important that we pull together the various strands of the Acts, including the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. That is what it is. It is important we embrace all those provisions in this legislation. That is why I support it. This is relevant for anyone who supports or who speaks against the 2010 Act or this legislation. We have the tools of the trade, as I said earlier, to put a stop to these people, get them off the road, take the wheels off their wagon and take the wind out of their sails. We have a proper framework of legislation that can be applied swiftly with the assistance of other agencies of the State and those all over the world to put a stop to the corruption and money laundering because they represent a cancer on society. We have looked in awe at other countries over the years. We saw it with some Third World countries and we still see it with corrupt governments and situations there. We were a pretty modern and young democracy. We should not have allowed this to mushroom, to be nurtured and to get-----

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	490	I understand amendments No. 4 to 21, inclusive, have been grouped together. Therefore, I will speak to a number of amendments and I trust that is permissible. I had a brief opportunity to start my contribution on the previous occasion. I made the point that it has been illegal for a motorist drive a car with a blood alcohol level in excess of the 50 mg limit since 2011. Despite many positive changes that have been introduced to our road traffic legislation, such as the reduction of the blood alcohol limit, the introduction of penalty points and random breath-testing, the fact remains that, unfortunately, we still have fatalities on our roads. The point I made on the last occasion and the point I want to make again tonight is that we should be focusing our scarce resources on tackling the area that is the biggest problem. The only up-to-date figures we have, which are certified and produced by the Road Safety Authority, are from 2008 to 2012. Of the sizeable number of fatalities in that period, 39 had a blood alcohol level of in excess of 250 mg, 37 had a blood alcohol level of between 201 mg and 250 mg, 25 had a blood alcohol level of between 150 mg and 200 mg and 20 had a blood alcohol level of between 100 mg and 150 mg. Despite that, this area is not even being considered by the Minister. He seems to believe, and he reiterates this time and again, that the only real deterrent for people who break an existing law is automatic disqualification. If automatic disqualification was the deterrent the Minister seems to believe it is, we would not have the fatalities in this category because those people are already liable if caught to be put off the road. If automatic disqualification was the deterrent the Minister says it is, the figure for 2016 which the Minister gave us on Committee Stage was that 8,063 people were arrested and detected for having alcohol in their blood that was over the limit. Of that 8,063, 93% were in a category that would deem automatic disqualification. The point I am making is that if automatic disqualification was such a deterrent we would have fewer people in the category of people who have been disqualified and fewer fatalities in that area. The real deterrent, and this has been backed up time and again, is the fear of being caught. Unfortunately, the checks are too sporadic. During the past number of years, the number of people working in the traffic corps has decreased from full capacity, which was more than 1,000, to approximately 667 now. There are 444 fewer people working in the traffic corps now than was the case when it was at full capacity. The real deterrent is for people to be afraid when they look in their wing mirror and see a blue flashing light behind them or for people to be stopped at an automatic check point. That is not happening now. During 2016, when a very good Christmas campaign was launched, it resulted in a decrease of 34% in road deaths compared to the same period in 2015 and a decrease of 27% in road deaths compared to the same period in 2014. I have no sympathy whatsoever for anybody who willingly goes out and breaks the law by drink driving. However, where I have sympathy, and I believe the Minister's proposal is disproportionate to the offence, is where somebody who takes a taxi, a Nitelink, shares a lift or whatever home, goes to bed, gets up the next morning and may be marginally over the blood alcohol limit of 50 mg. The Minister is now saying that person did everything right but we will put him or her off the road for three months. As a result, that person who may be the breadwinner and the only earner in the house will lose his or her job. I believe that penalty is disproportionate. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the blood alcohol limit is 80 mg. In Ohio and a number of other states in the United States, the blood alcohol limit is 80 mg. In Canadian provinces and territories, it is 80 mg. Already, we are below the blood alcohol limit in many other countries. What we are proposing as a party and what we believe to be fair and proportionate is to increase the penalty points to five and have a €500 fine. That is fair and proportionate in terms of the penalty. We have to remember that what we are doing now is being done against a backdrop of Garda breath test figures over which we cannot stand.In fact, the Road Safety Authority itself, in August 2017, stated: The Road Safety Authority (RSA) was greatly concerned [...] that there were significant discrepancies between the number of people actually being breathalysed versus the number recorded as having been breathalysed since 2011. Unquestionably, there is a direct link between the levels of drink driving enforcement conducted and compliance with drink driving laws. The absence of credible and reliable enforcement metrics such as the numbers of drivers being breath tested, makes it almost impossible to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of road safety interventions. This is especially valid in the context of the rise in road deaths over recent years. [...] One of the primary concerns for the RSA is the implications for road safety of inaccurate data being recorded and the potential lack of enforcement activity especially around the issue of drink driving which continues to be a serious problem in this country.Those are the Road Safety Authority's own words. It cannot stand over the data on which the Minister is relying for introducing this legislation. Are we, as legislators, meant to rely on good, sound data? I believe we are and in this instance, we are not doing so. Assistant Commissioner Michael O’Sullivan published a report on the examination of the recording of breath tests at mandatory alcohol-intoxicant testing checkpoints, which stated:The examination calculated breath test data from 7th June 2009 – 10th April 2017 and determined that 3,498,400 breath tests were recorded on PULSE compared to 2,040,179 recorded on Dräger devices. This identified a discrepancy of 1,458,221 breath tests between the Dräger count and the PULSE count, which reflects a 71% disparity between breath tests recorded on Dräger and those recorded on PULSE. I have no intention of filibustering this legislation. I have been fair at every opportunity the Minister has come before the House. If there is any reason for delays it is because the Minister has not been able to secure time in the Dáil to debate this issue since he published the Bill in February of last year. What the Minister proposes is disproportionate. The Minister is operating on a foundation of sand because, as the Road Safety Authority and an assistant commissioner acknowledge, we cannot even have confidence in the facts provided. I believe the Minister is going for low-hanging fruit. If the Minister is serious and genuine about tackling the scourge of fatalities on our roads, why is he not prepared to bring in far stricter measures for drivers in excess of 80 mg or 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood where the vast bulk of our fatalities occur? As somebody who is totally opposed to drink driving and who wants to ensure that impaired drivers are off our roads, I believe genuinely the best way to do so is to increase the Garda presence on the roads. The Minister failed to ensure there was an increase in the traffic corps last year. I hope the Minister will be able to honour his commitment this year. The Minister should not punish somebody the following morning who is marginally over a limit that is already lower than that applicable internationally and put him or her off the road for doing the right thing. It is unfair. It is disproportionate. The Minister should reconsider what I have proposed, which is fair and balanced.

I am not a member of the Select Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport but I read carefully all the comments by colleagues at that committee. The points the Minister made on his proposal are fairly unanswerable, in particular, that between 2012 and 2016, 3,003 fixed penalty notices were issued to drink drivers in the 51 mg to 80 mg alcohol concentration bracket, alcohol is a factor in 38% of road deaths and, most importantly, the Road Safety Authority tells us that at least 35 people died in collisions in the period from 2008 to 2012 which involved drivers being found responsible owing to alcohol levels between 21 mg and 80 mg. These are decisive statistics, unlike what Deputy Troy has said, and they make a strong case. When one looks at the overall situation again this year, for example, last month we had 17 fatalities compared to just seven in April 2017 - ten more people died on our roads last month than in the same period a year previously - and 55 people in all have died on the roads this year. Fifty five tragedies is an incredible number. I welcome again to the Gallery the representatives of the PARC road safety group, in particular, Ms Susan Gray and her son, Stephen, Mr. Noel Clancy and his daughter, Fiona, and Mr. Alec Lee, who have campaigned strenuously for the key two amendments, I believe, improvements, in road traffic law which this Bill constitutes and on which the statistics are strong indeed. Deputy Troy referred to rules in the United States and in Canada. If Deputy Troy, who is a diligent transport spokesperson, looks at the road casualties in some American states, in particular, states such as South Carolina, Alabama or North Carolina, which are roughly of the size and population of Ireland, he will find that the casualties on Irish roads are devastating. I believe that the Minister has made a powerful case for the original insertion of this amendment Bill and the House should speedily enact it. I commend the Minister. I believe the amendments that have been submitted to dilute this, whether involving five penalty points or whatever, unfortunately, will detract from road safety and will permit a horrific situation to continue whereby alcohol will be a significant contributory factor to deaths on our roads.

The whole issue, and the difficulties that we have with it, were compounded the other day when I saw a report whereby somebody stated that upon the passing of this legislation what people can be sure of is that there will be a concentration of members of An Garda Síochána out early in the mornings seeing what sort of a result they will get from a more stringent and more concentrated effort at the early morning breath tests. Deputy Troy rightly mentioned in his contribution that the result of this could impact on drivers who would be very marginally over the limit the morning after doing everything right. At the end of the day, all we are talking about here is fair play for drivers who try to do the right thing. Such drivers, who go out at night, perhaps seldom, maybe with their wife or whatever, do everything right. They get a taxi or make an arrangement. The following morning, they are on their way to work and all of a sudden find themselves falling foul of the new penalties that would be in place following the enactment of this Bill.That is why I still have the same problems. When I last spoke on this I made it quite clear I do not blame the Minister for everything that has gone wrong in rural Ireland but I see this as doing nothing to help the situation. I acknowledge that other people have put forward different arguments in support of what the Minister is doing. In case the Minister thinks he is without his supporters, there are people out there, as well as politicians here, who agree with what the Minister is trying to do. It has to be acknowledged. The Minister has his supporters. Unfortunately, when it comes to what the Minister is proposing in this Bill, I do not support it. I do not support it on certain grounds. It is why I and others have tabled a number of amendments that we want to be included. We want it to be changed. That is why we will be going through this in great detail, as we would be expected to do. If we were not to do so, we would be neglectful in our duties. At the end of the day, we are charged to be here to represent people. There are two sides to this argument. We feel we are right and that the status quo, the way the system is at present and the penalties go far enough.  I am terribly sorry. I will not go into personal detail because it would not be the right thing to do. I am very sorry for some of those who have contacted me in recent days. I have heard from individuals who gave me what I would call harrowing accounts of life experiences they have had. That has to be acknowledged. Would I want to see that happening to anybody else? Obviously I would not. Do I think what the Minister is proposing here today will stop it? I do not. That is fundamentally where we have the disagreement. It is not that I do not respect the people who contact me and what they told me. It would be wrong to say that. I am only a human being the same as they are. Any one of us can fall foul of events that happen day-to-day in our lives, such as accidents and different things. None of us is immune from that. When it happens to anybody, let it be someone we do not know. When people contact us and tell us their stories, it is obviously a harrowing thing to be told. Like other Members in the House, I have heard from people. I appreciate them taking the time to contact me and talk to me. I hope I did them the proper courtesy of listening. I am sure that by acknowledging what I was told they will realise I did listen. They might ask why I am not changing my mind and why I do not support the Minister. I still fundamentally believe we cannot legislate for every accident. If we could there would never again be an accident. They changed the way cars are made to reduce deaths. They made crumple zones. When the Volvo car came out first it was supposed to be the safest car going because it had all these different devices to make it safer than every other car. Now every car has every type of modern contraption to try to protect and safeguard the occupant of the car. At the end of the day does it completely reduce the number of people dying on our roads? It does not. Our roads have been improving including the surface of roads, their alignment and their entrances and exits. Everybody is trying to do their part. Our local authorities are playing their part in trying to reduce the deaths on our roads. Gardaí are playing their part. Sadly, we will still have people dying and being maimed on our roads. Can the Minister and the Government and we as legislators completely stop people from being hurt, maimed or, sadly, dying on our roads? We cannot. We never will. If this legislation is passed in its entirely without amendments and if the Minister gets his way completely, does it mean it will impact and reduce the numbers? Will we finish up at a stage where we would all love to be if we could be and that would be that people would no longer die on our roads? No we will not. I fully believe that. We will not, no matter what we do or what anybody does.  It is like farm accidents. Year in, year out, we have seen farm incidents becoming more prevalent and more common. Sadly, we have people being maimed and dying on our farms in an awful number. It has increased in recent years despite the good work of people in the IFA, the ICMSA, the health and safety regulatory authorities and everybody campaigning and trying to make people aware of accidents and incidents and how to prevent them. Have we reached a stage where people are not dying on our farms? We have not and we will not because we cannot legislate for every eventuality. We cannot legislate for every accident. We cannot ensure people will not die in their workplaces, on building sites or in factories. It is happening all the time and it will continue to happen. There is nothing we can do. If I thought this would make a big change and would help us to reach a situation where people would no longer die on our roads, of course people would have to look very closely at it but I am not convinced.  I am not infallible. I do not have a monopoly on being right but at the same time, like everything in life, in politics one has to make a decision and make up one's mind about what one thinks is right and what one thinks is wrong. I think this is fundamentally wrong. I do not think the Minister has thought it through enough. I do not think the officials who have worked with the Minister, and for whom I have nothing but the utmost respect, have thought it through. I really think people are losing sight of the argument here. People are reacting to a situation where, very sadly, young people are losing their lives on the roads. What I have always said is that when the Minister looks at the problem he should look at it in its entirety. One of the things I could never understand - it is not the Minister's fault - is why previous Ministers did not look at this. When I refer to Ministers, I refer to those in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and also to former Ministers for Education and Skills. One of the most sure things young people are ever going to do when they are going to school is to finish up driving a motor car. How could one say that any youngster today going to a national or secondary school will not finish up in charge of a mechanically-propelled vehicle? We know they absolutely will. It would be fair to say 99.9% of them will do so. What are we doing in the education system to prepare those people for that monumental task? We are doing nothing. We teach them every other subject. We teach them everything. We prepare them for every aspect of life and one of the most major important things I can think of is that they will be in charge of a mechanically-propelled vehicle, they will be able to drive at a considerably young age and will be on our roads. We are doing nothing to prepare them for that. I really cannot get my head around it. I would be supportive of the Minister if he was coming in here and the Minister for Education and Skills was alongside him and he was saying it was his opinion that on leaving national school and going into first year in the secondary schools it would be compulsory on the curriculum that every day or a number of times a week youngsters would be trained on the issue of road safety, what it means to be courteous to other drivers, what it means to be careful, to value their lives and to protect other people and then to engage them on the rules of the road.The majority of our young people would not dream of drinking and driving, though we will always have exceptions to that and situations for which we cannot account. I can never get over why we have not been educating young people in our schools about the use of motor cars, and this is something I have spoken about before. If we did that it would be very useful in creating awareness.

This is the Minister's solution for road safety but there are many other aspects of the problem which the Minister should tackle. The Minister for Education and Skills has not made a contribution and never discusses it when he goes before the teaching organisations. Our teachers have enough to do but I am sure they would welcome it if the Government and Ministers introduced education in this area of the curriculum, in the interests of safety. They should make it compulsory. It is compulsory to have languages and other things but not to be trained in the rules of the road or told of the major responsibility it is to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle. I would love the Minister to do that rather than this. This is a political reaction so that the Department can state that it is doing its best to save lives by bringing legislation before the Dáil. I am not convinced about it, however. If I was, I would support the Minister.

I emphasis "drunk driving", however, because I do not believe that someone who has consumed a pint, or a pint and a half, and is under 80 mg is a drunk driver. The Minister is on some kind of a crusade and does not have constituents in rural areas who depend on their car to get to work, college or anywhere. In rural Ireland there are no other means of transport and there has been no attempt to ensure people can be catered for in this way. If a mother or father go to work but lose their licence, as Deputies Troy and Michael Healy-Rae said, as a result of having more than 50 mg in their blood tomorrow morning they can lose everything, because without a licence in rural Ireland they cannot get anywhere or do anything. They have to be driven everywhere and that is too costly. It is hard to get a licence back and it is hard to get insurance again. I am sorry that the Minister described me as a "road traffic terrorist" and spoke of me and my "gang" in some other forum today. I have a family at home and I do not think the Minister would like to be called a terrorist. I will deal with that in another fashion and I have sought legal advice. I never hurt or harmed anybody and never thought I would be so described. I have a licence to drive every vehicle on the road and I am proud of that. I got my first licence to drive a tractor aged 16 and did a driving test in a motor car, a rigid lorry, an articulated lorry and a large coach. I am licensed to pull a trailer after a coach and I am proud of that too. I am very hurt by being called a terrorist and the Minister will answer to someone, somewhere, as to what he means by that because I am not letting it go. Maybe the Minister has lost the run of himself because there was mention of some of them going to Korea to sort terrorists out there.

The Minister could just as well be calling those people terrorists as well. The Minister has thrown a lot of things at me in this debate, such as the accusation that I was fighting this for publicans, but in the course of scoraíochting in Kerry, people went to each other's house to visit and break the monotony of their lives. Nowadays, they have to drive because their neighbours are further away and the closer neighbours have left or emigrated. Rural Ireland was badly hit in the 1950s but in recent times it has been hit much worse. People drive to each other's houses but they cannot even have one drink now because they cannot be sure they will be under the limit and they will be afraid of losing their licence. The one bit of recreation they had, which was to go to neighbours' houses, will be lost. It is not about publicans but about loneliness and having something to do in rural places, where they do not have theatres, cinemas, basketball courts or gyms. They will now be totally isolated and will have to listen to the radio, because there is not much to watch on the television nowadays. Deputy Troy asked why we were being scapegoated. In Northern Ireland one can legally drive with less than 80 mg, and the same is true in England. There is a lot of talk about a hard or soft Border but we are only one field away from Northern Ireland in many parts of the Twenty-six Counties.We will have a less severe rule in the North and a more severe rule in the South. In France, a person who is found to have between 50 mg and 80 mg of alcohol per 100 mg of blood will only be fined. In the debacle around breath tests we learned that numbers had been doubled and trebled, such that nobody knows the true number of breath tests conducted. We also can no longer trust the figures being provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Minister mentioned that there were 36 fatalities between 2008 and 2012 which were in the 20 mg to 80 mg bracket, of which 19 were in the 20 mg to 50 mg bracket. As such, the Minister's argument does not make sense. I asked for a breakdown of those 36 fatalities to include if the accident was caused by a drunk pedestrian walking along the road who had fallen onto the road in front of the car; a person who had had two glasses of lager or Guinness and was driving on their own side of the road meeting another driver with no alcohol who was speeding, lost control of a car and crashed into the person's car and maybe killed himself and his wife. I got no answer to those questions. I also asked if among those 36 fatalities was a young fella who had one pint after work who met black ice on the way home and hit a bridge to which I also got no answer. I oppose drunk driving but I honestly believe that a person with a pint and a half or 50 mg to 80 mg of alcohol is not a drunk driver. I note Fine Gael is supporting the Bill. It is supporting the Minister for his support for Government to make up the numbers. I regret this because I know so many Fine Gael Deputies enjoy the support of people in rural Ireland who will be hurt by this Bill. If this Bill would reduce accidents or fatalities I would be behind it too but I do not believe it will. In the city of Dublin, there are many modes of transport, including taxis, the DART service, buses and trains. A person with his or her thumb up in Gearhasallagh, the Black Valley or Lauragh would be waiting a long time and no bus or taxi will come. He or she could not phone for a taxi because there is no coverage in most of those parts. The Minister is welcome to Kerry any time but if he does come he should not try thumbing a lift around the Incheese because he could be there from May to November and no car would come along. The Minister would be fairly cold and would still not have got a drive. It must be realised that this will have a serious, detrimental impact on people who lose their licence as it is so hard to get it back. They will lose their insurance, and may never get it back. I appeal to the Minister and the Government. I know many members of Fianna Fáil do not support the Minister but I do not know what the Fianna Fáil leadership is saying or doing. Many fine Fianna Fáil members oppose what the Minister is doing but we do not know what way they will vote. I will be voting against this Bill. Many of the people about whom I am speaking would vote against if as well if permitted to do so. The Minister is so anxious about this Bill that he broke every rule in the book when he came in here one day, sitting in the second row, reached forward and pressed the voting button of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and he got away with it. Had I or Deputy Michael Healy-Rae done that we would be on every news programme in the world about what kind of criminals we were, but the Minister, because he is Minister Ross, got away with it. Whatever happens with this Bill, we will continue to go after Deputy Ross because that was illegal. Regardless of whether he is a Minister or Lord Ross or whatever he is called, in doing that he broke every rule in the book.

The Minister might be laughing now but we will challenge it as far as we can. The Minister does not seem to care. He is on some kind of a crusade, some kind of a power ego trip, to get this Bill through. However, he does not realise he is hurting honest, good living people. I am speaking for Kerry. Every other Deputy can speak for their own rural area because people in those areas will be hurt too. No accidents or fatalities were caused by people in the 50 mg to 80 mg bracket. The Minister needs to realise what he is doing. He does not realise how the people of rural Ireland have to manage, where a car is everything. Under this legislation a person found to be 5 mg over the 50 mg permitted will be put off the road for three months. The person's employer may not wait and the children may not be able to go to school. It will make a vast difference and rural Ireland will never again be the same after the Minister, with the support of Fine Gael, enacts this legislation. Rural Ireland is being hit. Since I came up here there has been so much talk about what the Government will do for rural Ireland. This Bill is another way in which it is hurting rural Ireland. All people in rural Ireland asked for is to be left alone but they are not being left alone. They are being targeted by so many other different things, and now the Minister is targeting them. I know they never did anything wrong to the Minister and they never would. This Bill will hurt them for ever more. Ye threw it at us that it was fostering or aiding and abetting public houses. However, I am after outlining to the Minister that it will affect people who visit friends and neighbours across their parish and locally. This legislation will hurt them because they will not even be able to have one bottle of beer while having a conversation. All of that is gone forever. On the roads I am talking about, the most speed a person can do is 20 miles per hour in second or third gear. There will be no car ahead or behind you. On the first day I went to the committee that was discussing this Bill I made the Minister aware that farmers have only one vehicle. They either have a van, a jeep or a small tractor yet they are being treated the same as a professional driver in terms of the 20 mg limit. I am asking the Minister to do something about this.I ask that something be done at least to bring them up out of that bracket because they are treated the very same as an articulated truck driver or a professional bus driver doing the maximum speed on the motorway. Even though they may only have a small jeep, a small van or a small tractor, their limit is 21 mg. This is the way they are being treated by the law. People are also being told that if they use their commercial van for private purposes, for example, to go to mass, and they are caught, the law will be applied forcefully. The person is supposed to have what is known as private tax on the van. If the person is caught using the van or jeep for his or her private business, such as going shopping, going to mass or any social event, the person is supposed to have private tax on the vehicle which costs about three times more. If, however, the person is caught in the same van with 21 mg of alcohol in their blood, he or she will be put off the road. I asked the Minister to do something about this and he said he would look at it, but he did not do anything about it. All the Minister is interested in is putting people off the road. I do not support this Bill because it will not help to reduce accidents. There are myriad things that would help, with the support of the Minister. As I came to the Dáil yesterday, I noticed a branch hanging over the road between Mallow and Kildorrery. It will fall down onto somebody. I have told the Minister about this stretch of road before. It is in a very precarious state. The branch is not very big, but if it hit a woman who might be travelling along the road with her children, she would be killed. She would then be a statistic. The Minister just does not care. He could have had something done about the trees since the recent terrible storms by making a law to help landowners who cannot actually go out on the road for fear of being blown off it. The local authorities, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, farmers and landowners should work together to ensure that nothing falls onto the traffic travelling on the road. That type of situation can kill. The Minister, however, has no interest in that. All he wants to do is paralyse these grand people in rural Ireland and put them off the road. It looks like the Minister is getting his way because he has the support of Fine Gael. We do not know about the others. Sinn Féin supports the Bill also, even though its members are elected by rural people. Sinn Féin will have to answer when they call to people's doors. I would advise those Deputies not to bring the Minister with them because they will not get very much support. Having supported the Minister, I do not know what would happen those parties. I do not wish bad to anyone but I guarantee that those Deputies should not appear behind the Minister because he is not welcome in many places around rural Kerry. This will hurt-----

I hope he told the licensing authority that because if he has not done so, he will not be insured in a car he might drive. Perhaps now that he is a Minister with his own driver, he does not care about having a licence or not, but fine for him if he does. I put it to the Minister and to all the Deputies in the Chamber that this is the most serious blow to rural Ireland and to people who just cannot manage without a car. If they lose their licence, they will be stranded at home and will be lonelier than ever. I do not believe this will save one life. This is my honest humble belief. A pint or a half pint is certainly not dangerous and people could be under 80 mg. They kind of say that they know that anyway when one looks at England, the North of Ireland and France. Deputy Troy referred to states in America which allow over 80 mg, but we in Ireland are guinea pigs: "Let us test these fellas out and put them off the road; these fellas do not matter." Reference was made to rural transport and that the Minister would propose the operation of 36 or 38 buses in rural parts of the State. I put it to the Minister that 36 buses or taxis would not do a quarter of Kerry, not to mind the rest of the country. The Minister is only trying to cod the people. That is not what he is actually doing. The people of Ireland know, and the people in rural Ireland know, they are being militated against and that there is no necessity whatsoever for this Bill. One of my amendments provides that the three penalty points would remain but that if a person was caught or detected in the bracket of 50 mg to 80 mg, he or she would be obliged to undertake ten driving lessons with a qualified driving instructor. This would be beneficial because drivers everywhere need to do refresher courses to keep up with new legislation and new ideas. This measure could benefit people in rural areas. Some people may not come into towns or cities often and it would bring them up to speed about new laws, new systems, new ways of driving and so on. I will be moving that amendment. The Rural Independent Group members have different amendments. Deputies Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins will deal with amendments Nos. 14 and 17. My amendment is amendment No. 15. It would be beneficial, if we were to go down this route and in the spirit of improvement, for drivers who are detected to have to do ten driving lessons with a qualified instructor. The Minister's proposal for an NCT for tractors will hurt so many people. He has angered and aggravated many people by what he has proposed. I do not know where the Minister is getting his ideas from but if it is from the Department, it is to be regretted. I believe the Minister is on a crusade of his own with regard to the new drink driving penalty. This is to be regretted. No one in any Department, or in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, could suggest it so it must be the Minister's own idea. Given what the Minister did with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone's voting button, it proves that he is very anxious to get this over the line. A great many cyclists are killed. In the Heritage Bill, we ask that roadside hedges are kept cut all year round because people use the roads all year round. The hedges and briars prevent cyclists and walkers from keeping close to the ditches. In Dublin, there are motorways and the roads are wide. Where I come from, a 3 m road width is about what one gets in the rural countryside and maybe less at times. When the hedge growth goes beyond the yellow line, people are practically walking in the middle of the road and if it is after nightfall and is dark, then pedestrians and cyclists are killed. There is no attempt by the Minister and no interest on his part. The Minister should be the first to go into the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development to suggest doing something to support us when we look to get these roadside hedges cut, and to keep them cut all year round. There is no accountability. He was out somewhere in the middle of Dublin calling me, Danny Healy-Rae, and his gang terrorists. There is a drainage programme but there is nothing about ponding water, which is taking roads completely over. People are being killed in those instances too. When they meet another car and there is a lake of water in the middle of the road, and one is doing 40 mph or 50 mph, one cannot then see where one is because 20 gallons of water might have gone up on the windscreen. Nothing is being done about that, even on national primary roads. I could take the Minister around Kerry but I will not. He will have to make it himself. I could go on for the next 20 hours because the Minister is hurting so many people. There is no need for it. He will achieve nothing by it. It is an ego trip by the Minister so that in 20 years' time, he can say Shane Ross did this. That is what he will have to his name. I have talked so much about this because in my heart, I feel strongly about it and regret what he is doing. I will also regret that it will have been in my time here that this happened. I will say to the people of Kerry and all over the rural parts of Ireland that it was not for want of trying. The Minister has the votes and will win it unless he changes his hat or direction and I do not think he will do that. It was not for want of me fighting the Minister. I am sorry that the people of rural Ireland will be hurt. The Minister is the man who is stopping them from having one and a half pints. He is the man who thought of it and Fine Gael supported him. I will never forgive the Minister for it. The people of Kerry will never forgive him and the people in rural Ireland who have no other way to travel but their car will never forget him for it. He will be remembered for that. I do not appreciate it.

We did some pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill and had the Road Safety Authority appear before us. I attended those pre-legislative scrutiny meetings with an open mind on this issue. Many things that people expressed about it show that it is a big deal. I understand that it is a big deal to change that sanction. I understand that is a change in sanction, as opposed to a new sanction. I was impressed with the Road Safety Authority. We got a regulatory impact assessment and we considered what options might be recommended regarding this aspect and others. We also heard from the person who did the analysis behind the statistics we have been given. I thought it must have been pretty difficult for the person doing that work because she was not looking at dry statistics but was looking at the inquests from all cases where there had been a fatality. She read through the details of all of those. The reports were subsequently compiled on the basis of not just numbers, but real people who had lost their lives. Between 2008 and 2012, 16 people, or 6%, were killed in collisions where drivers or motorcyclists had a recorded blood alcohol content, BAC, of between 50 mg and 80 mg. That is 16 people who lost their lives. While people say it will not impact on people, it might not impact on millions, thousands or even dozens of people, but it will certainly impact profoundly on people who are alive today who we want to keep alive. It is never nice to have to add sanctions and put restrictions on people because it is a curtailment of freedom but people have a right to feel safe on the roads and we have a responsibility to make sure that whatever we do keeps them as safe as we possibly can on the roads. The RSA document states:The stark reality behind the statistics and one of the hardest things for victims and their families to deal with is that drink driving does not happen by chance. Sadly it happens by choice.The literature on the effects of alcohol on driving is extensive and consistent. Alcohol in almost any amount impairs driving or driving-related skills. In 1998 and 2000, 117 studies and 112 studies, respectively, were reviewed in reports by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the USA. The results of the reviews can be summarised by a finding from the 1998 report, which states there is no lower threshold below which impairment does not exist for alcohol, which is of course a sedative. I was concerned and teased out some of the figures relating to the morning after people had been out for a night out. That often involves home drinking and measures are not the same. It is almost safer for people to be in pubs because people do not tend to use measures and things in the same way as they would in pubs. We teased that out. I was concerned that that was unfair on people. We were told that 14% of all alcohol-related fatal crashes happen between 6 a.m. and 12 noon. Some 15% of all alcohol-related fatal crashes involving a driver or motorcycle rider happen between 6 a.m. and 12 noon. Where there is a slight variation there, it is directly related to drivers or motorcycle riders. I acknowledge the committee did not produce a report in which there was an agreed recommendation but we gave this quite detailed scrutiny. Many of us who went in with an open mind felt that we were convinced. I certainly felt convinced by the road safety aspects that we heard and I thought the pre-legislative scrutiny was quite useful from that point of view. It gave us access to people who are charged with considering these matters and recommending changes. There is an interesting point which I referred to before and will refer to again about public support.Behaviour & Attitudes conducted a face-to-face barometer survey with a nationally representative sample of 1,000 adults in January 2017. Some 91% of Irish motorists surveyed supported any driver caught over the drink-driving limit being automatically disqualified from driving, with 61% of those who indicated support believing the driver should be disqualified for more than 12 months. The Bill does not do that but there is a higher sanction for a greater threshold. Some 89% of adults in urban areas and 93% of those in rural areas indicated support for any driver caught over the drink-driving limit being automatically disqualified from driving. Public attitudes on this issue have been clearly tested. I listened to some of the descriptions of Kerry and how it does not have amenities and so on. I was in Kerry for a few days last year and was very impressed with the wonderful amenities there. It does the county no service to run it down in the manner we have heard in the past few minutes. Kildare has two public swimming pools for a county of 220,000 people. When anyone asks me where the swimming pool for north Kildare is, I tell them it is in Kerry, which has four public swimming pools. One was closed because there were not enough people to support it. I ask the Minister, Deputy Ross, to note that argument.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	515	The idea that certain parts of Ireland are well provided for because they are close to cities or are in commuter belt areas is inaccurate. It does no service to Kerry to represent it in the manner we have heard. There was a contrast between an acknowledgement by one of the Deputies from Kerry of the improvement in roads and the opposite being said by another. I was on the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport for pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and was open minded and listened to the facts. We should base our legislation, regulations and road safety on evidence. The committee received that evidence and found it convincing. The measures in the Bill may not be measures one likes to put in place but they must be implemented in the interests of public and road safety. For that reason, I will be opposing the amendment tabled by Deputy Troy.

It addresses many matters of importance. It deals with very sensitive matters and I commiserate with anyone who has lost a loved one in a road tragedy. I have encountered many families so affected in my work and have seen the devastating effects road deaths have on families and communities. In the context of the Bill, in the past week I have been described as being part of a team called a disgrace and might have been described as being part of a team who were called terrorists. That was said in the belief that I am trying to block the Bill. I have spoken on the Bill for 16 minutes since Christmas. Surely to God, if we live in a democracy Members should be allowed to speak for 16 minutes on legislation that will have serious effects on my community and neighbouring communities. Although I will not go into detail on the remark accusing me of being a terrorist because I do not think it was directed at me, I did look up the dictionary definition of a terrorist. It is defined as being a person who uses unlawful violence. It is astonishing that, if that allegation is correct, a Deputy was called a terrorist but that is an issue between the Deputy's legal team and the person who called him that. I am not a disgrace for speaking on this very important issue for 16 minutes since Christmas. The person who called us that is abusing her position. She was an elected representative in this Dáil many years ago and, surely to God, she spoke for 16 minutes on various issues. Perhaps she did not and that is why she lost her position. That is another day's work. I have asked whether the Bill and amendments have been rural proofed. That is of great importance. The programme for Government commits to rural-proofing of legislation and that is very important in respect of this Bill. The Government is obliged to consider the effects that any new legislation would have on rural Ireland: would it damage rural Ireland or make the lives of people there better? I am concerned that the Bill would have a damaging effect on many living in rural Ireland, in particular young people who are trying to hold down jobs there and their parents, who the Minister is threatening to criminalise. This is a very anti-rural Bill and could be extremely damaging to rural Ireland. Young people have to wait for up to seven or eight months, or longer, to get a driving test in rural Ireland. Many such people live in rural areas in which there are few or no daily bus services. In order to get to work, many have no choice but to use a motor vehicle as their means of transport. However, the Bill provides that if they drive without being accompanied by a qualified driver, their parents or the owner of the car could be guilty of a criminal offence. I suggest to the Minister that the Bill be modified to allow learner drivers awaiting their test to drive to and from their place of work without criminalising their parents. That would mean that young people who had not passed their test could not use a car for social or entertainment travel but could do so to travel to and from work.  As I have previously highlighted, several other measures could be put in place which could make driving by younger people safer. For example, speed limiters would limit the top speed at which a car could travel and might improve public safety. These are small measures that perhaps should have been considered before the dramatic solution was decided upon. I have previously raised the poor condition of our roads and the serious accidents and deaths caused as a result. Last summer, two American tourists were killed at Waterloo junction on the Cork to Mallow road. It is a dangerous junction and road signage might be an issue there. Last week, another tourist had a very serious accident at that junction. In spite of the pleas from many quarters, nothing was done. What steps were taken to make that junction safer in the past nine months? In my constituency, tens of thousands of euro will be spent on installing beautiful sculptures on the Halfway roundabout on the Cork to Bandon road. That will presumably be funded by Transport Infrastructure Ireland. Sculptures are lovely but of greater importance to my constituents is that the roundabout is the gateway to south west Cork. Many people are asking why money is being spent on the roundabout while the wheels, tyres and shocks of motorists' cars are being damaged by potholes only a mile or two beyond it, and throughout west Cork. Who authorised payment for that sculpture but will not sanction money to save lives on our roads? That is a very important question which must be answered so that I can relay that to the people of south west Cork. A footpath is being installed around the roundabout even though no one would consider walking anywhere near it because they would be blown off the road as it is a busy roundabout. I do not know how many tens of thousands of euro it will cost. It might cost a few hundred thousand euro but that does not seem to matter. There is money for sculptures but no money to repair potholes, whether on roads in Bandon, Clonakilty, Drimoleague, Dunmanway, Bantry or on the way down to Mizen Head. There is no need to worry about that.It is only a few potholes. That is just one example of road conditions leading to deaths, but road conditions throughout rural Ireland are appalling. That has been mentioned here time and again by other Deputies. The fund being put in place is totally inadequate. Why does the Government not ask each county council to furnish a realistic estimate of the cost of ensuring that there are safe and drivable conditions on the roads within their counties? We could ask Transport Infrastructure Ireland to do the same for the roads for which it is responsible in each county. That could be done quickly and would highlight for the Government the inadequacy of the current funding. Instead of throwing money at, say, a sculpture, it is time to look at the bypass in Bandon or try to better the environment in places. We should stop wasting money. If we spend it sensibly first, we could then consider the provision of sculptures. I have no doubt that if road conditions improved, the number of serious accidents and deaths would definitely fall. The Minister mentioned last week that he appointed to the board of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, relatives whose loved ones were killed on our roads. They are the right people to be on that board but does the Minister have the authority to appoint such people? I stand open to correction in respect of this matter. I will need to listen to the recording of last week's proceedings. I did not have time to do so, but it is astonishing that the Minister can appoint people to boards when he is trying to stop politicians appointing members of the Judiciary to boards. While the Minister, or somebody else, was correct to have those people on the board, people have been killed due to the condition of our roads. Are their loved ones on the board of the RSA? People have been killed by falling trees on our roads. Are their loved ones on the board? Those are extremely important issues also. Everybody should have an equal voice on the board, or is the Minister just choosing people from one sector? Those people need to have a voice on the board but so do others. I would like the Minister to clarify the position. I will listen to the recording because if the Minister has the authority to appoint members to the board, that is a dangerous move. We need clarification on that. I have spoken on many aspects of this Bill and I will not spend much more time discussing them. Everybody knows my views on rural isolation and our elderly people and many others who used to enjoy having a social drink. Thankfully, they came from and returned to their homes safely all their lives. It appears that is coming to an end, with nothing being put in place to ensure that those people will not suffer from serious rural isolation or mental health issues. I do not see anything coming forward in this regard but I hope the Minister can correct me on that also. I have spoken on the Heritage Bill and verge cutting. All those issues are extremely important and are a major cause of stress for people driving on the roads in the current conditions. At various crossroads in west Cork in June or July, whether it be on the Mizen Peninsula, the Beara Peninsula or the beautiful Sheep's Head Peninsula, most cars are out in the middle of the road before they can be seen. The number of accidents, near accidents or near-death incidents is astonishing. People who are trying to cycle or walk have to go out into the middle of the road because we are not allowed cut the verges. Those areas need to be looked at seriously to make sure that every aspect of people's lives are catered for. The section on cycling has been removed. I am delighted because I had serious concerns in that regard. There are many cycling clubs in my area and the members are great people who promote events in their communities. They were talking about requiring motorists to give cyclists a 1.5 m clearance when passing from the rear. I think Deputy Troy was bringing that in but I have to disagree with it because it would mean that if I was to abide by the rules in my area, I would have to go over the ditch and drive through the fields to get around somebody on a bicycle. That was never going to work. My daughter, Eileen, lives in Ballinalee, County Longford, which is in Deputy Troy's constituency. It would not work on the roads in that area either because they are in the same condition as those in my constituency in west Cork. I could be here talking about this Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill for the next hour. I have very serous concerns about it. I know what it will do to the people of rural Ireland. I would like the Minister to do a serious audit on the way money is spent in his Department. Some spending can be wise in ways but it is definitely not enough, particularly when it comes to sculptures. I will give the Minister one example. I was in Lyre in Clonakilty, last Sunday and I looked at the bridge where the residents of 20, 25 or 30 houses are able to travel to and fro on that section of road. That bridge was damaged by a storm in 2013, which was no fault of the Minister, and it was closed. There is no money to fix it so the residents now have to travel four or five miles on a round trip away from it. The point I am making is that the Minister should forget about the sculptures and put the money he has available to him into fixing bridges and roads. I would be cautious about bringing the Minister down to my area again. I brought him down last year but there are many people who are very angry because they did not hear back from him. He saw the scandalous condition of our roads. I mentioned it on a radio programme the other day and I received a telephone call from somebody telling me that I was a disgrace. I told the individual that people in my community had to drive on the wrong side of the road when they are going to work in the morning to avoid the poor conditions on the N7, which they have to use. One gentleman told me that if he drives on the right side of the road, the tools in the back of his van end up partly in the front of it. There is no money for repairing the road but hundreds of thousands of euro have been spent on sculptures. That road is in a bad state. The Minister was in my car when the bottom of it walloped off the road. That road has not been touched since and has got worse. I know that if people travel that road on the proper side, it will lead to a loss of life. However, the Minister does not have that statistic with him tonight. Sadly, the statistics the Minister has are driven by people who should be examining all the issues. We should consider the state of the roads following the flooding events we have experienced. Some of the roads have been trounced with water. There is no drainage and no funding to drain away the water. We no longer have roadside workers because there are no funds to pay them. The local authority received 700 applications in respect of a recent advertisement. I would like to know how many jobs are being offered; perhaps it is two or three. In some cases, people should travel the roads on a boat and not a car but, again, that problem will go unheeded. As I said at the outset, the Minister should stand by the Constitution and treat everybody in this country alike. I do not appreciate being called a disgrace but I suppose I have been called worse. I certainly do not like my fellow Deputies being called terrorists. The Deputies I know would not hurt a fly. They are decent, respectable people. I would be surprised if whoever said it stooped to that level. We might tell people they are wrong or whatever but we do not call people disgusting names. As I said to the Minister, a terrorist is a person who engages in violence. I am sorry but that is not anyone I know.

#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	519	I have submitted amendments to the Bill, as have Deputies Troy and Danny Healy-Rae. If he reads them, the Minister will see that they contain many common-sense proposals. There is also compromise in the amendments tabled. We should be clear on one aspect.The reason these amendments have been submitted is that in parts of rural Ireland the nearest taxi service is 15 miles or 20 km away. There is no rural bus but people need transport to get from A to B. The amendments refer to certain things that are required to save people's lives, the first of which is good roads. We are all aware that funding for rural roads has increased in the last two years by between 4% and 8% but it is still below what it was in 2008 under the last Fianna Fáil-led Government. Funding for such roads in Galway went down from €40 million to €19 million, which was a drastic cut. Whether one is a young driver or an elderly driver, one needs a proper road. There are potholes like craters on some rural roads and one would nearly lose a car in some of them but the Government does not seem to want to address that problem. That may be because it wants to get into people's heads and make them think that it has solved another problem but the fact is that if we do not have proper roads there will be major problems, regardless of whether people drink. That is chronic and it is not confined to the west of Ireland. It applies to all of Ireland. I have seen parts of Meath and God help the people who were trying to come out the roads up there. Of course, if the Government diverts attention away from that it is easier because addressing it costs money. It costs the Government money in a budget.  I notice that a few of the Minister's comrades were rolled out in recent days to attack individuals. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion and people can say what they want but if we brought drink down to zero right across Ireland this minute, what difference would it make? This Government and the previous one watched over a reduction in the traffic corps from 1,070 gardaí down to fewer than 600. Whoever did that is the terrorist, not those who were called such today. That decision was made for financial reasons. The previous Government had a massive majority and I was here for 14 months of that Dáil. Legislation was guillotined and rushed through this House in two hours. It was an awful pity that the head of the RSA did not get her Bill together at the time instead of coming out and criticising people during the week. They had the opportunity to do it. At a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, I put forward proposals relating to young drivers and members from all sides agreed with me. I proposed that speed limiters would be put on their vehicles. The Minister might not understand lorries but those of us from the country understand them. If one is driving a lorry, there is a limiter on it and one can fix that limiter to whatever speed one wants. If the limiter is set at 30 km/h or 40 km/h, the engine will cut out above that speed. That would have been a solution or a step forward in terms of enabling youngsters to get insurance at a price they can afford.  Before introducing legislation with which people in rural parts of Ireland disagree, one needs to take proactive steps to make sure that people can live and survive. It is fine for those who have the DART, Luas and taxis available 24 hours a day. There used to be a programme on the television called "Come Live With Me". The Minister should come and live down the country and he will see the situation. A lot of mothers and fathers have youngsters going to college. Those in the south might be going to Cork or Kerry, those in the east might be going to Dublin, those in the midlands might be going to Athlone, those in the north might go to Letterkenny or Sligo and in the west, they might go to Castlebar, Galway or Limerick. The average wage for a farmer is €18,000 per year, which means that many are not able to pay €6,000 to €8,000 for accommodation for their youngsters. They are trying to make things better for them and some of them put their children on their insurance as a named driver.  When I was a youngster, we learned to drive in the fields. We had fields in rural Ireland and in summer time we put posts or cones in the field and learned how to drive. In that way, before we ever hit the road, we were well able to drive. It is not politically correct to say that anymore in this world. One is not supposed to be doing things like that but that is the reality. That is how most youngsters in rural Ireland learn how to drive and then, when they get their lessons, they have a feel for it. As they say down the country, they have "a feel for a yoke" and know how to handle it. People do not understand that. There are compromises in what Deputy Troy has proposed in terms of increasing fines and penalty points. The Rural Independent group has also put forward compromises. Indeed, what I have put forward myself contains compromises to make sure that things are made better while not crucifying the people. When I talk about a compromise, I note that the State is good at making laws but is a youngster entitled to a test within six weeks? If the State has an obligation to provide that, in black and white, it cannot back out of that obligation. Unfortunately, however, there are parts of the country where the waiting time for a driving test is between four and six months. All one will hear from the people in charge is that they will recruit more testers. Where are the testers and why have they not been recruited? The reason is that they have to go through a process and it takes a good while. Of course, we decide that we will introduce the laws before we solve the problems. Was there any bit of thinking by the Minister for Finance that before introducing this legislation publicans would be given a rebate on the duty paid on a car or a minibus? Was there any thinking about that, to try to go a step of the way in terms of helping? I heard this great brainwave out of the Government, that it was going to provide 35 buses around the country. There are 5,000 km of back roads and byroads in Galway. If one was to go around the villages between 9 p.m. and 12 a.m. to bring people to the different towns, villages or local pubs, one would not get to them all even if one was driving at the speed limit but the Government talks about 35 buses across Ireland. Whoever suggested that was not much of a mathematician.In my opinion, gardaí are the secret to making sure roads are safe. It costs money to deploy gardaí, patrol cars and everything that goes with them. Unfortunately, people who have lost someone belonging to them are thinking tonight that this measure will solve something. It is a sad thing to say, but my belief is that the limit can be reduced to zero and it will not make a difference unless Garda numbers are increased again. The Government is getting inside people's heads to make sure they believe something will be solved even though it will not. We expect to have safer roads even though the number of traffic corps gardaí has decreased by almost 50%. They are good people, but with the best will in the world there is not a hope they can do what they are supposed to do. During the week, people were rolled out to hit those of us who are going through the democratic process. They did so by suggesting that this legislation is being filibustered. I am sure that as a public representative, I am as entitled as anyone else who has been elected to this House to table amendments and speak on any legislation, such as the Bill we were debating before we moved onto this Bill. If the Government is seriously concerned about this issue, why did it leave the Minister, Deputy Ross, in the lurch for nine months? He was not allowed to come near this issue in the absence of any commitment from the Government. Some people do not want to see that. When this legislation was introduced, it was made known to us that further sections would have to be added to it, which meant there would have to be a recommittal. It might be no harm for that to be acknowledged. I would like to speak about the big problem that ordinary folk out there see with the Government. People never mind change as long as the path is resolved ahead of it. In this House, we are mighty at bringing in rules but we are very poor at bringing in solutions. We do not seem to want to solve things. What are we going to say to the youngsters on apprenticeships about whom Deputy Danny Healy-Rae spoke? How will we make sure people on low incomes are catered for? We will hear the usual palaver to the effect that they can get grants. They can get grants if they are eligible - for sure - but they will have to wait from September to Christmas for payments to be made. That is the first thing. They will have to live on fresh air for a while. The second thing is the cost of accommodation for youngsters whose parents are trying to make sure they get a better life. As I have said previously, I am all for youngsters being able to do intensive weekend or two-day courses in places like Mondello Park and get certificates when they are finished. There could be a place in the north, a place in the south, a place in Munster, a place in the west and a place in Ulster. I could go out on a road this minute with a digger and swing it around as long as I had done a one-day course. Cars could go up and down by me and it would be fine, as long as I had done a full weekend and someone had said I was fit to drive it. I am not talking about going out in a vehicle like this without being fit to drive it and doing lessons. Why are we trying to make criminals out of young people and their fathers and mothers? Do we take pleasure in telling people who are struggling that we will bang them up? To be honest, I do not take pleasure in doing that.

Everyone respects cyclists, but we need to have a common-sense approach to all of this. Deputies might not be aware that there is machinery in rural parts of Ireland that is 7 ft. or 8 ft. wide. A mower might be 10 ft. wide. Someone driving one of these vehicles might struggle to go down a road, even if he or she does not meet anyone on the road. If we tell such a driver to keep 1.5 m away from someone, he or she will have to bust ditches in everyone's fields to get down the road. This is an example of the stupidity of people who do not understand that a motorway is one width and a secondary road is another width. A bóithrín might be just 2.5 m in width. If it is 3 m in width, it is nearly a wide one. Many of them are 10 ft in width. We are talking about machinery going down such roads. To put it very simply, any low loader is 8 ft wide. One uses one's head when one meets such a vehicle coming along the road. One stands and one allows them to go by. There is no need to put rules on such encounters. One does not drive on in a way that means the driver of the other vehicle has to go up on top of a ditch. We cannot legislate for some of this stuff. Those who are used to driving on the N11, where there is a lot of traffic and many cyclists, should be aware that they will not see roads of the same width when they travel to other parts of the country. We have to make sure we do not get carried away with ourselves. When we go on a roll with things in here, it can be like a wave bringing us along. Sometimes we have to make a stand and show some common sense. My amendment and that of Deputy Troy are quite similar. I have no problem if his amendment is taken first or is given precedence because it has been tabled on the same basis. We are saying that the fine and the number of penalty points should be increased. We have to be mindful of the amount of rural isolation that has unfortunately developed. It is biggest issue I have with this Bill. There are many elderly people in rural areas. They are lovely people who worked throughout their lives. When I speak to them, they tell me they like to go to the local pub to have a chat with everyone over two little glasses. I was talking on Sunday to a person who came to Dublin with me. He went to a pub with his brother, who had gone away for a good few years. He looked back at his brother and he said that publicans here should be paid for what they are doing in addition to selling drink. He responded by asking: "Are you off your head or what is wrong with you?" The people in that pub probably saw nobody all week before they came in to have a little chat. The word "inclusion" comes to mind. There are day care centres doing great work in a similar vein, but Saturday or Sunday night is the night. It is not as if these people are going to the pub seven nights a week. I worked in pubs when I was a youngster to keep myself in pocket money. I served people who used to go through everything that was happening in the country. When the 9 o'clock news came on, they asked for silence. That was their life. They were happy. The problem now is that they are afraid when they hear of the likes of this. Their fear is the fear of what might happen. I think it is sad. I was talking to an 85 year old person the other day. He told me he can go nowhere now. It is probably a sad reflection.If the Minister does not want such people to go anywhere in their cars, we should at least make sure that before we put that fear into them, we provide a solution so they can say this new thing is great or the man in the pub will bring them home. That is the problem. The Minister might ask why the Government should provide a rebate on vehicle registration tax. Some of them provide a service as two, three or four people in a rural pub would hardly pay for the electricity bill, never mind make money. Those people in the evenings open up. Anybody in any part of rural Ireland sees this. From Monday to Thursday, at least, those publicans do a service for their community by opening. They might make a few pounds on Friday, Saturday and Sunday night but if there are two or three people looking in, they will not make money. It is something we do not appreciate. If we had a system to offer people something, there would be some bit of hope in trying to resolve the matter. The Minister should bear in mind what I said earlier about the taxis being 15 miles away. If a person rings a taxi and tells that driver to pick up Johnny in the pub, who is on his own 15 miles away, what would it cost? More people will now drink at home and end up not talking to anybody. In fairness, in rural parts of the country we are trying to get people to go to different places for social inclusion. What has been threatened for young drivers should be wiped away. I do not know why we must be heavy-handed in threatening decent people who never put a foot wrong in their life with jail. I heard a new idea from an insurance company for drivers of facing down their phones in exchange for an incentive. It is proactive and it will probably help. The company monitors phone use and people can gather points in exchange for a discount in insurance. Fair play to whoever is doing it. Speed limiters were also suggested but nobody bothered with them. That process might be trickier but if insurance companies had been consulted, they would have helped. In fairness to youngsters, they are proactive. The Minister might think this is a vendetta by eight or ten Deputies but it is not. Our job is to listen to what we hear on the ground. It is about representing what we hear and being a Teachta Dála is to be the voice of the people. We are hearing that the heavy hand is coming at rural Ireland every day of the week. Unfortunately, it is putting people into their own homes morning, noon and night. It appears they should stay there. There is a fear of somebody catching them at night or the following morning, which is the problem. Solutions needed to be added to this before this legislation was introduced. I suppose when one does not live in the environment where solutions are needed, they will not come. When one sees a bus flying up and down the road until midnight or 1 a.m., one probably does not know what it is to be without a bus. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle said we are discussing amendments Nos. 4 to 21, inclusive. I will support many of them. I know the Minister will table an amendment relating to young drivers and my understanding is they will not be jailed or the car will not be taken from them. What else will not be done? Will those drivers still be done despite the State failing to give them a test? That needs to be clarified. There are people living in different parts of the country and I hope we do not put more fear into them. I have some final comments. The Minister may bring in all the legislation in the world he wants in any Department but the bottom line is it costs the Government if it wants to enforce that legislation. It costs the Government because of policing. It is no good telling somebody we brought something down or people are off the road if there is nobody to look for them. The Government and its predecessor have failed to sustain the numbers in the traffic corps. The Government might be trying to kid the people but it will not kid everyone.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	522	I will not endorse any form of filibustering and I will only take a few minutes. It is my first time to address this Bill and I will only speak to one point in support of Deputy Robert Troy's comments this evening and over the past number of months. I do not sit on the transport committee or anything like that. I am no different from any of the other rural Deputies who have come before the Minister to speak. I will keep this short and sweet. Living in rural Ireland, we do not have footpaths or a taxi service, as Deputy Fitzmaurice said. The nearest taxi service to me, believe it or not, is either Ballinasloe or Loughrea. I do not have a taxi service within 25 miles. I do not endorse drink-driving by any manner or means but when the Government wants to bring about provisions like this, supports and services must be put in place first. If we are to follow this through, enforcement will be required but there are not enough personnel on the ground to ensure it can be followed through. Legislation is worthless unless everything is in place to support it. I am referring to the traffic corps, gardaí and community policing, which are scant in my area. In order for Galway to be at a basic minimum, 40 more gardaí are required. That information is not mine but I got it through parliamentary questions in the past two weeks. I support what my colleague, Deputy Troy, has put before the Minister this evening. It is unfortunate that he has not taken the measure on board and we did not start with compromise by going from three penalty points to five points and a €200 fine to a €500 fine. While we would get the results of such measures, we could have been bringing up the levels of gardaí and putting in the required infrastructure to support the people living in rural Ireland. We have spoken about rural isolation and mental health. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the time to speak.
#JackieCahill	unknown-#JackieCahill-party	unknown-#JackieCahill-dob	unknown-#JackieCahill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	523	Like Deputy Rabbitte I will speak in favour of Deputy Troy's amendments. We will not be successful in getting the Minister to see common sense. None of us on this side of the House condones drink-driving and one life lost in an accident is one life too many. Proper policing of the existing laws is required. If a person is caught going 5 km/h over the speed limit, he or she does not see the same penalties or fines as somebody driving 70 km/h or 80 km/h over the limit. A loss of a licence for a person in rural Ireland in many cases leads to a loss of a job.Their licence is their livelihood. The Minister, Deputy Ross, has managed single-handedly to put the fear of God into most of rural Ireland. Rural isolation and mental health issues will be compounded by this Bill being forced through. We spoke earlier on a mental health Bill introduced by Deputy Browne. Unfortunately, we are going to see more consumption of alcohol at home. The whole social fabric that we know in rural Ireland will be decimated.  The Minister is the man who will close the door on rural pubs. The Minister has mentioned filibustering and the talk about alternative transport is most definitely it. There is no alternative way to get home in rural Ireland. I appeal to the rural Independents supporting the Government and rural Fine Gael Deputies, who know what they are doing is wrong, to vote with their conscience. They should do the right thing and support Deputy Robert Troy's amendments. If these increased fines and penalty points were introduced and properly policed, we would have a common-sense solution.  What the Minister is forcing through shows his lack of understanding of rural Ireland and the way it operates. This is not Stepaside. There are not three or four alternative ways of getting home. We have a lot of elderly people who have made up their minds that they will not go to the pub anymore. That is a sad day. These are common-sense amendments. Even at this 11th hour, I appeal to the Minister to see sense and bring in the changes we propose as with extra policing, we would achieve the aim we want. 
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	524	Like Deputy Rabbitte, I am not on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. I felt these issues should be left to those on that committee. Listening to the debate tonight, I felt I would be a hypocrite if I did not make a contribution. As someone who takes a drink, I will let the drinker who is without sin cast the first stone. The whole issue here centres on responsibility. Young people are setting a trend. If one goes into one's local pub there is a designated driver. A sensible approach in the main has been taken. I acknowledge there are always those who will flout the law. The debate tonight, however, centres on the issue of the penalty. I am, like Deputy Cahill and as the Minister is aware, of the view that politics is about the art of compromise. I believe Deputy Robert Troy's amendment of five penalty points and a €500 fine would set a trend that is a compromise between automatic disqualification and the current three penalty points and €200 fine. We should see how that pans out. It would be unrealistic if we did not listen to the advice of those who know that impairment - and I know it myself as does anybody who takes a drink - is affected by body mass, what one has eaten etc. and will dictate the ability to drive. Ultimately, the 50 mg blood alcohol level is recognised by all of the proposals on the table.  There would be a continuation for those who are not in a position to get a taxi for €5 home within urban and some rural areas. That would be in the interests of rural communities. Others have alluded to rural isolation and the need for people to socialise. Isolation is where one will not get a taxi at a late hour at night. It is wrong to penalise those people. However, setting the marker a little bit higher with five penalty points and a €500 fine, as proposed by Deputy Troy, is a reasonable compromise. It accepts that drink does kill. I mentioned the word "responsibility". The vast majority of people out there are responsible in their drinking habits. At this late hour, there is room for compromise. I encourage the Minister to accept Deputy Robert Troy's amendment.
#KevinOKeeffe	unknown-#KevinOKeeffe-party	unknown-#KevinOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#KevinOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	525	The last time I spoke on this Bill was on 8 December 2017. That night, one of the oldest rural pubs in north Cork, the Function Bar, closed. That bar made its living out of people who drove to the pub and had a couple of drinks. They did not pass any other pub. These people have since been left in rural isolation. They are the older generation, not the young generation. I speak tonight on the original Bill. I will not make any comments on the amendments being brought forward, even though the Bill has been turned into a cocktail for the want of a better word. The Minister is the man who came out with a knee-jerk reaction over a year and a half ago when there were many tragedies and road fatalities. I accept there were but the Minister decided to go after the social drinkers and take them out of the equation. There was no thought whatsoever. The Minister took the soft option.  The Minister is attacking us as filibustering. We are not. He has had the legislation and the paperwork in his Department for a year and half now. It typifies the Minister. He is being inactive in his Department. He has failed to get work done. As he said at the recent Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, he does not get involved in direct activity in his Department. I refer to his comments in respect to the sports capital grant applications. He said that he threw any letter he got from politicians with representations into the bin. By God, he is probably right because that is the way it worked out. Luckily, those people who made applications in my area made good applications and were successful.  The Minister is inactive. I say that strongly. There have been many other issues in his Department where he has been found to be hands-off, such as when the road hauliers looked for a derogation on the axle issue. The big issue was Ireland's Rugby World Cup bid and getting us onto the playing field. He made no attempt at all to get us a few votes across the water. The only place he succeeded was in England. He could not even sway the Scottish. The Minister got away with murder on that issue. A year and half year later, he is deriding us. Before I go any further, I want to say that I am not a terrorist. I read his recent comments in my newspaper, the Irish Examiner. If it is guilt by association, I will be known as a terrorist on the road. I am not a terrorist. I do not condone drunk-driving or excessive drink-driving. I want to emphasise that. The Minister is taking the heart out of rural Ireland. He could be taking the heart out of leafy Dublin or taking the heart out of suburban towns where they have no pubs within three quarters of a mile of the town centre where there are leafy suburbs. He is taking no consideration of that fact. As I said to the Minister, he is the man who is doing the filibustering. If he was any good, he would have come here 12 months ago with proper legislation to allow us to debate it accurately on the main point. The Minister allowed people to come in with the 1.5 m rule for cyclists and the regulations for pedestrians to wear hoods and so on. I agreed with those but this legislation is different. It is unrelated and it deflects from what we are talking about tonight. The Minister has had the proposal for over a year. Did the Minister look at any of the other issues when he reacted to this proposal on drink driving? Did he look at the issue of roads and the safety of junctions and so on? Many other issues and factors cause crashes. The Minister is the man with the cheque book. He is the man who can help rural Ireland and towns. He can help to alleviate the occurrence of crashes. The Minister can close his eyes, but I am disappointed that he has found this one point in his portfolio as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to attack rural Ireland. I have considered what the Minister is doing at the moment. The Minister has responsibility for sport as well. We have sports organised by the GAA and up to recently there were red cards and yellow cards. If a player received a red card, he was gone. Let us imagine the red card is the response to getting a drunk driver off the road. A yellow card, which is what we are talking about at the moment, gives a person a second chance. What the Minister is trying to do is to bring in a black card. On the GAA playing fields, the team gets another player, an alternative - in other words, there is a substitute. However, in this case, the Minister is providing no alternative for an innocent person who inadvertently might be over the limit in the morning. The Minister has provided no alternative for transport, whether bus, taxi drivers or a second driver. That is the big issue here. The Minister is trying to turn a yellow card into a black card without any proper consideration for the damage he will cause. Reference was made to mental health. The Minister should think of peoples' careers and the knock-on effects this will cause for those who are put off the road. I hope that those who lose their jobs in such situations do not go further beyond the mental health problem - I say as much sincerely. Last August, when people like us were saying the legislation should not be changed, the Minister came out with some of his pressure groups and threw it at people that they were the cause of people being killed. That is incorrect. The Minister went on about drunk drivers and that category of people and that was unfair. If a Palestinian throws a little scud over the border into Israel, the Minister and his cohorts come back like the Israelis with bombers. That is what the Minister comes back to us like. In other words, there is no proper balanced argument on the issue. That is why I am speaking tonight.

I do not want to filibuster but people forget. The Minister has amnesia. It is not only about the Minister as an Independent Minister. It is relevant for his coalition with the Fine Gael Party. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is a former Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and oversaw a deliberation. Committee members met but the committee report was inconclusive on whether this law should be introduced. That is a fact. The Minister should read the statement. When the now Minister of State with responsibility for sport signed off on the report, it was inconclusive. We could not agree overall whether this legislation was necessary. That is a fact known to everyone in the House. I remind the Minister of that fact, but no one has taken account of it. I have spoken already on this Bill but the Minister has done damage. I do not believe the Minister has any heart in rural Ireland or with the people. I am not asking the Minister to measure the drink that people should have; they should know what they can and cannot drink. I will not mention a half pint, one pint, a drop, a medium or whatever. That is not why I am here. I am simply asking the Minister to let the status quo stand and to support the Fianna Fáil amendment. It goes some way to saving the Minister's face, if he wants. That is the big issue here. I believe he is out of order by pursuing this issue with no proper background information. I have asked the question umpteen times. The Minister said in his opening statement to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport that it was abused, yet he could not give me figures showing how many repeat offenders were in the category that he is trying to put off the road. The Minister said they were abusing it, but the figures for repeat offenders were not brought forward properly. I appeal to the Minister to accept the Fianna Fáil amendment. It is a simple amendment and I believe it would save everyone in the House and be progressive. I appeal to the Minister. We have seen one rural pub going already in my back yard. I see pubs closing down every day. More important, the young people of today are a new breed but the Minister should not kill the dying breed.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	539	Tuigeann an Leas-Cheann Comhairle an fáth go bhfuil mé ag rá é sin. She chose it. I did not mention her the last time I spoke so this is not repetition. This is the first time, an chéad uair. The following comments were apparently made by the Minister today. I have seen them in the print media and other media as well: "A number of rural TDs have opposed the bill, saying it would damage rural areas, but Ross accused those TDs of behaving like road traffic terrorists." I call on the Minister calmly, coolly and collectively to reflect on that statement and have the dignity and good grace to withdraw it. Dan Breen occupied the seat that I am in today for many years. He had it for decades in fact. He was called a terrorist. He had a sulky bulldog appearance and he fought for Irish freedom. That freedom means we are now elected to this Parliament today. He came in here most days, I am told, but I never heard that he came in without a six-gun. I do not carry a six-gun and neither do Deputies Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Healy-Rae, Michael Collins, Kevin O'Keeffe or any of the others. It is totally intemperate and disgusting language. Let us consider the connotation given to what is happening throughout the world with terrorism, such as al-Qaeda and ISIS. God knows what is happening, with buses and vans being driven on top of people and everything else, yet the Minister decides to equate us with such people by using that kind of language. I appeal to the Minister, and I appeal to the Taoiseach who appointed him and gave him the seal of office, to have the Minister restrained. Anyone who can should talk to him also because that was appalling. I am unsure whether it was a slip of the tongue or whatever but it was well-delivered and it looked like a press release to me. If we are accused of filibustering, then so be it.This is legislation in respect of which the Minister has engaged in filibustering. It is like he was making a rake of hay - he almost had the hay gathered when the wind came and scattered it. He scattered the Bill everywhere. In fact, he has used a blunderbuss instead of engaging in a filibuster. The Minister wanted to add in cyclists, those driving with L plates and God knows what else, and that is what delayed the legislation. Neither I nor Deputy Danny Healy-Rea are on the committee, but Deputy O'Keeffe is a member. We went to the committee to discuss our amendments and they could not be discussed because the Minister did not have them because they were not ready. The legislation was not ready. It was the Minister's fault. It was light a slow-moving train or like the Luas he has designed for Dublin that cannot get across O'Connell Bridge. We would take a few Luas lines and buses in Tipperary if he would give them to us but he will not give us anything, not even the scraps. The Minister can smile all he likes but that is unbecoming of him. He has four more long days after tonight and then, on 6 May, his ministerial pension will be secured. Is that what he is waiting for? He is stuck to this Government like God knows what. I do not see many in here supporting him. He had the Ministers of State, Deputies Halligan and Finian McGrath, for a while but he has been a lone ranger in this debate. I have been here for every hour of it. Not a single Fine Gael Deputy nor any member of the Independent Alliance has been in the Chamber. There are screenshots and everything else on Facebook whereby people can see that the Minister was left in here on his own. What is wrong? I know that before Christmas he was giving out yards to the Whip's office and everything else for not having this legislation ready. I am a member of the Business Committee and we discuss every week what business is to be transacted. We do our best to do it well but it was as if there was nothing else in the world but this legislation. This is at a time when we have discovered that 19 died as a result of scandalous neglect on the part of the HSE. The Minister is happy to support the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and Mr. O'Brien, the CEO of the HSE. Where is the political accountability? The Minister wrote for decades for the Sunday Independent and other publications and he had answers for everything. He called for openness, transparency and honesty and for quangos to be out, out, out, just as Margaret Thatcher said about the Downing Street agreement. The Minister is obsessed with this legislation. It is not fair, balanced, reasoned or capable of being implemented.

I did not interrupt anyone tonight. I have sat here all night. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair and other Members chaired this debate. I hope the Minister will reflect on the terrorist remark, and that other people will do so as well, otherwise we will have to be forced to take another route to make him to apologise. That route would be a costly one. Tá an tAire ag gáire anois. I am not going to allow my name to be besmirched or to allow anyone describe me as a terrorist. I have been elected by the people of Tipperary for the time being thankfully. As long as they continue to elect me, I will represent the constituency, as Dan Breen and many other good people did before me. Dan Breen was not a terrorist either, he was a freedom fighter.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	551	I am sure they are on the record and attributed to him. I asked the Minister previously to look at many issues in the context of road safety. He could have considered a plethora of issues. One of these relates to the statistics for driving test. I want him to comment on the statistic confirming the number of people waiting to be scheduled for driving tests, which is deeply alarming and a further indication of the disarray that is afflicting the learner driver system. The RSA confirmed to me, by means of a reply to a parliamentary question in March, that a total of 44,746 applicants nationally were waiting to be scheduled for tests and now the Minister is going to try to bring in legislation to criminalise them. These people cannot get tests. What is being done represents putting the cart before the horse. I will not say the word to describe that but it starts with "a" and ends "ways". It is ridiculous. These figures go to the heart of what I and others have been saying for sometime now, namely, that there is a chronic backlog afflicting this sector. That backlog is, in turn, creating serious knock-on effects. The Minister will pass this legislation because obviously he has some kind of hold over Fine Gael, at least for another four days. It is probably a quid pro quo. I know that. I am not just speculating. What is deeply alarming is that the figure of almost 45,000 does not include those who have already been scheduled for tests. I do not know what number is in the system. There could be 15,000 or 20,000 in the system and there are 45,000 waiting to be scheduled. The 45,000 who are waiting merely reflect those waiting to be given testing dates. Many of them have testing dates and they are not included in that figure. The RSA, which is chaired by a former Teachta and member of the defunct Progressive Democrats, informs me that, in part, this is due to the number of driver testers who have retired in the past 12 months. Wait for this part. It does not specify how many testers have opted out of the system or the reason for that. Why is there such a shortage? Why have so many of them retired? Is the system so dysfunctional that they cannot remain in it? The RSA has also told me that it has taken on 23 new testers since 2016 - not 2017 - but that only six of those will have commenced operating by this year. What is going on? Where are the other 17? Why would it take from 2016 to May 2017 - yesterday was May Day 2018 - for them to be appointed to their jobs? I wish them well. I have no axe to grind with any of the testers but what is going on? If that is not incompetence, what is? Are they being paid? I am sure they are if they have been recruited? It could not take them two years to learn everything? Do they have to take a theory test, get L plates and get someone to accompany them while driving? What is going on? Will the Minister answer those questions? He will not because he is not interested. He cannot answer them. He is obviously presiding over an unmitigated mess. He is also the man who said that he was totally opposed to quangos and that he would never appoint any people. Then he appointed two good people, as has been said, for good reason, but did they go through the proper process of public appointments to boards? That is all I would ask about them. I wish them well on the board, but they want a bigger and more expanded board and more fun and games. That is playing with people's lives, which is what the Minister has accused us of doing with his terrorism comment, as did the head of the RSA in accusing us of causing lives to be lost. I resent that greatly because I am pro-life. I am all for helping people out like cabhrú leis na daoine, a Teachta Dála, a messenger of the people, and it my raison d'être for being here. The Minister made that suggestion, as did the head of the RSA because we were opposed to the Bill. I will ask the head of the RSA to withdraw that comment. The language they used was intimidatory. It was as if they were trying to frighten or scare us from representing our people. That is what is going on. If we represent people in rural Ireland, we are accused of being aliens, Neanderthals or God knows what because we cannot fall into line with the Dublin brigade. Once I am all right Jack, it is a case of to hell with the people outside the Pale. The 23 new testers have been taken on. Where are they? Why are only six of them working? What is going on. This is incompetence in the extreme. I raised this matter previously with the Minister and he did not answer me but his officials might be able to help him out. In my county of Tipperary, which I am proud to represent, from Carrick on Suir up to Moneygall, Clonmel, Cahir, Cashel, Thurles, etc., 1,700 people are waiting to be scheduled driving tests. This demonstrates the enormity of the problem at local level. What the Minister wants is that people who are waiting for tests and those who fail tests for the slightest reason who are caught driving - he wants the Garda to impose this if he gets his way - to have their cars taken from them. He also wants those people to be fined and brought before the courts and the owners of the relevant vehicles - whether it be the parent, guardian, sibling or whomever - to also be fined. Furthermore, he wants the cars to be seized and the people involved jailed. The Government cannot imprison those who should be in jail, namely, the people who are presiding the scandalous murder of 18 women. Let us get real here. There is no talk of jail for them. They are above anything of that sort and that is all right.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	557	I am thinking about that but I have not heard any response from him at the committee or anywhere else. I have tried to discuss this with him privately and at different fora but he has not been prepared to do so. He is hell bent on passing this legislation. It is his swan song, especially coming up to the two-year anniversary of his appointment to ministerial office, which is very important to him and some of his Independent Alliance colleagues.Why can these people simply cannot get a test within a reasonable period? The Minister cannot legislate to put them off the road, lock up their parents, impound the car and send them to jail if they cannot get the test. It is not their fault they cannot get the test. Passing it is another issue. Many of these drivers have done the theory test. We have people returning from America or other countries who emigrated and were wanted back, and they are forced to go through a theory test and a driving test and forced through everything. It is insulting to those people, who drove here for maybe 20 years and drove in America in all kinds of situations, that they are forced to go do a theory test. It is madness. As I said, I want answers to those questions. The Minister is making legislation that is unimplementable and his colleagues who will vote for it are doing the same. Those 1,700 people cannot even get a test. I salute a school in Tipperary town, the Abbey School, which as part of the TY programme has a simulator and a driving tester comes in and gives lessons. It is a wonderful scheme that it has run for years. That should be in every school, if they have the space to do it or acquire a track. There is a man in my town, in Cahir, as well who is looking for permission to build a karting track and he has offered it as a simulator track to train people in how to drive and help to educate these young people. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí and they always will. We have great young people. We must admire them. The Minister is making criminals of them when, in their effort to finish their education, they must have a car. To go to an apprenticeship, they must have a car. To go back and forward from their place of work or school, they need a car. They do not have the school buses. The Minister has some antiquated school buses out there in the fleet and he has not done anything to sort it out. I attended a school in Deputy O'Keeffe's town, a wonderful class of TY as well, in the brothers' school in Mitchelstown, where they had done a project on wearing seat belts in school buses. Approximately a month later, I saw - thank God, no one was hurt - that a bus turned over and they had to come out through the bus driver's door, and the heroic driver and heroic students helped them out. There were no seat belts. It would be more important to bring in legislation for that, not a carrot and stick to fine them but to try to encourage them. They do not wear seat belts in the school bus. I asked my own daughter and she said it was not cool. That is more important. A bus can travel at 50 mph carrying 60 pupils on the roads, some of which are not fit for a donkey and cart. These roads, which the Government will not address either, are in an awful state. We must encourage young people to go forward in life and learn to drive. I was outside and I heard someone, I think it was Deputy Fitzmaurice, talking about how most farmers' sons and daughters thankfully can learn to drive the tractor and rudaí mar sin such as machinery, on the land and they are expert drivers when they come out on the road and can pass the test with no problem. Others, in towns and places, do not have that facility. The majority of the Government's school buses have no seat belts and the fleet is outdated. There are taxi drivers who the Minister is forcing to replace their cars after ten years. These are the finest of cars, that have passed the NCT and have passed a further test that they have to do to be a taxi involving measurements and space and safety issues, and they are banished. It is another stupid act. I go to other countries and some such cars are 30 years old. Their clock has gone around six times and they are flying around. Then there are many old buses in the fleet that are 20 or 30 years old. There is a plethora of areas the Minister could look at if he cared to but he has zoned in on this with a passion to tell those people in rural Ireland that he will sort them out, and "I am all right, Jack." As I said, those 1,700 people cannot get a date for a test, let alone get a test. What if they are stopped by the gardaí? I know the gardaí and I support them 100%. No country can be governed without the support of the public, and the gardaí themselves know this. The Minister will have legislation that will make criminals of young people. God knows, with the mental health issues and the stigmas around so many other issues, in the legislation we are passing here the Minister should not be trying to make criminals of them. That is what the Minister is doing, clear and simple. By not allowing them to do the test, not providing for a situation where they can get a test, not appointing the testers, and not cleaning up the system and making it fit for purpose, the Minister is making criminals of our young people, both in rural and urban Ireland, who want to get their test.

We did not have that at all when we were young and we passed our tests and got our licences. They cannot get the test after all the cost involved. Then they can fail for the slimmest of issues, if a car is defective in any way during the test. I had a case which I will not repeat because the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will say I mentioned it earlier, but if the same thing happened with a seat adjuster or whatever, the driver fails. There must be a sliding scale. If the person is competent to drive the car, obey the rules of the road and do everything that he or she is expected to do in the test, for example, the three-point turn, and God knows whatever else he or she is expected to do as I have not had to do a test for years, he or she should get the licence with a restriction. If something is defective in the car, it probably was not defective but fell off as a result of the potholes on the way to test centre. That is what has happened, in rural areas or in some streets in urban areas as well. Frustration is something that drivers from rural areas will be used to. They have to be used to it. As I said, they cannot get the tests.  The Road Safety Authority, in its wisdom, and the previous Minister - the Minister, Deputy Ross, who was sitting up here in the back seat a few years ago objecting to most matters - had the NDLS learner driver permits debacle, another sad, sorry spectacle. We have an office in Clonmel about which we fought for nearly two years. The Road Safety Authority procured it. It was a building that was empty on the side of a bypass and no one could find it because the then NRA, now TII, would not allow them put up a finger-post sign for people to find it. There are others in that business estate-----

I have pleaded with Deputy Mattie McGrath and Deputies who have continually repeated themselves. I believe it is the will of the House that Members would want to hear a response from the Minister tonight. If that is the will of the House, I ask Deputy Mattie McGrath to consider at least giving the Minister 15 minutes to respond tonight.

There is wide scope. It is the Minister who, because of the amendments, has been responsible for the recommittal. Deputy Troy had to recommit. Amendment No. 4 happened to be his but there are many more amendments in the names of other Deputies, including the Minister.

That is very unfair. I have this well researched and I am speaking to script most of the time. I never mentioned the NDLS previously but I am mentioning it tonight because they could not find the building in Clonmel. As I said, the RSA set it up and procured a building, the NRA would not allow them to put a sign up, and one had young and old going around to try to get their driving licence, going into other businesses up the road in the estate and interrupting them to know where was this centre. It could not be found.The one in Arklow was a portakabin that there was no space in. It was a shambles.

We eventually got signs put up on the road, not on the main road but on the by-road heading into the state. I saw one yesterday morning thrown in a ditch with a stone keeping it standing. That is the way the signs are being operated. I am sorry I did not take a picture of it. That is how the Department is operating the NDLS centre. That is the respect it has for the customers in Ireland. To hell with them. It is outrageous. There have been repeated complaints. In 2014, I tabled a parliamentary question to the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who is now Taoiseach, which revealed to me that the NDLS comprises three separate companies, all of which appear to be incapable of working efficiently with each other. I asked a direct parliamentary question to the Minister at the time about this farce of an operation which revealed, to my genuine shock, that there are three companies involved in the delivery of the service. There are three companies involved in the NDLS driver testing centres. Where are the Government rules on this? I do not know how the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, managed to keep a straight face when he indicated to me it was to ensure a more efficient and cost-efficient service. I am being distracted. I did not distract other Deputies.

The reality has been the complete opposite. We have the ridiculous scenario where SGS Ireland has the contract for the front office interface, Abtram for the back office processing and another company, Credit Card Systems, CCS, for the plastic card licence. I had a young man, a council engineer's son, who went to America on a J1 visa. Like any working person, he had his licence in the pocket in his shirt and the licence got destroyed. His father got on to the NDLS to see if he could get a licence which he needed in America and he was told his son could not and that he would have to come home and go to the centre. His father said he could not afford to come home because he has a job and is there on a J1 visa. He was told to come home by boat. We talk about the Famine ships. He was told to come home by boat. This is the kind of incompetence and messing that is going on. He would have to come home physically in this modern era with all our technology. He had a passport and everything else; it was just his licence that got washed. He had to stay driving and trying to get to work in America with no licence because it got accidentally destroyed. He was told to come home by boat if he could not afford the flight. That happened. It is on the record and the man is there to prove it.

I bow to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's experience. He is a long time in the business. It happened. It is a bad day when one does not learn something. If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has something to tell me afterwards I would appreciate it. I am always in the L-driving category as far as learning is concerned. I have no monopoly on any issues. The reality has been the complete opposite. We have a crazy situation. What on earth is going on when a service that was delivered almost perfectly for many years by the local authorities - we all had a great relationship with them - was taken away and reduced to an absolute mess by three different companies all of which apparently proved their worth in a competitive procurement process. It beggars belief. It is bizarre. My colleagues and many other Deputies raise the issue of An Post every day. It is a crisis at the moment with the post offices. We are interested in having them provide that service to free up the staff in the county council and elsewhere to deal with housing issues. They said they have been short-staffed since the austerity cutbacks. The then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, said in his reply to me that An Post had submitted a tender for the front office service but was not successful. The other three companies got it. I would love to see the transparency and the tender process. An Post looked for it but did not get it. Teachta Troy is a postmaster and so is Teachta Healy-Rae. We wanted business to keep the post offices open yet we gave it to private companies. They are three companies I had never heard of. They have made a right hames of it. The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, might know what a hames is; Minister Ross would not know. A hames is something that goes on a horse. From the information I had at the time, it seems An Post made a very robust and efficient delivery of the service proposed but they did not want to know. They decided to close down the post offices saying rural Ireland had too many of them and it did not need them. The NDLS and the companies of which it is comprised have done a spectacularly inept job which leads to one question. How independent are the competitive procurement processes the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, talked about? One has to scratch one's head and ask what is going on. What is going on in rural Ireland? Why are all these whizz-kid companies and plastic cards there and to hell with the ordinary people? I did not mention this before and neither did anybody else. I am old enough to remember a time when a Fianna Fáil Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, Ger Connolly, issued thousands of licences with no tests because there was such a backlog of waiting lists for tests. Many of those people have gone to their resting place and their good reward and I hope they are happy but many of them are on the road all of the time. Is that fair? Where is the equity? Under the Constitution we are supposed to treat all citizens equally. Many of them got licences. They just bought them from the county council because the testing system was not able to cope. Thousands of them were issued. Will they be withdrawn? Will they be checked up, brought back and made go for tests? I certainly hope not but I am saying thousands of them are out there. That is what is so farcical about this legislation. It is victimising and terrorising the people of rural Ireland without calling it that. That is what it is doing. It is making them into criminals, which they are not. Most of them are law-abiding people and 99.9% of them are being badly treated by vagabonds, robbers, thieves and marauding thugs. I do not say it for the sake of a history lesson. It is an indication of some of the blatant examples of how drivers in this country have been treated in recent years. It is unbelievable. I did not go near the issue of the contempt for citizens. The attitude is that people should do what we say or we will lock them up and criminalise them. They are the facts. The Minister is around longer than I am to know those licences were handed out. The proposal in this Bill will soon fall into the same category of unworkable and unenforceable law. The Minister has been warned about it time and again but he will not listen.

Whenever we reconvene on this Bill, I hope we will debate the amendments with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. As I said, the proposal in the Bill would soon fall into the same category of unworkable and unenforceable. It is very sad.As for the amendments regarding alcohol levels and the breath test, it only came to my mind today that the Minister said he had plans to introduce harsher sanctions for excessive speeding. A road safety group, PARC, and the motoring body AA Ireland have both stated that while the plans were welcome in principle, they would be very hard to enforce. Garda sources have also expressed doubt over the Minister's statement that he was considering more speeding sanctions that would involve more penalty points for motorists caught driving over the speed limit. It is a noble gesture but why does he not have it in the Bill? I support the Garda traffic corps, in which there are some great gardaí who also attend to crime if there is a 999 call in an area, thereby going above and beyond the call of duty. They did this in the two recent storms by helping people in all situations. They are asking why this is not in the Bill. The numbers in the traffic corps were reduced by half and, although both the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors are looking for them to be increased again, nothing is happening. There were no increases at all last year and they do not even have the vehicles they need to chase the powerful, high-speed cars which go by like a gust of wind or a jet stream which you cannot even see. They are more dangerous, as they could kill 20 people if they had an accident at that speed so the Minister should give the traffic corps the tools they need to apprehend those people. Speed cameras are another debacle and the bane of many people's lives. I have had debates with the companies concerned but they are no help at all. I have asked them to go to accident black spots, such as bad bends, but they will not. They go to places where it is like shooting fish in a barrel, catching people doing 80 km/h in an area where the limit is 60 km/h. A woman was caught going into and coming out of a school yesterday, in a 50 km/h zone where she was doing 54 km/h. It is horrible. I do not condone speeding but they wait in places such as the bottom of hills to trap people. An enormous cost is borne by the State for the GoSafe speed cameras. I do not know GoSafe and I have nothing against that organisation but the State has paid almost €88 million to private speed camera firms and has collected just €32.7 million in fines on motorists. The Minister is looking up at the sky or shaking his head but these figures are from his Department, or part of it. Is the Minister awake?

I did not believe he was sleeping. Can the Minister say why we did that? There was a scandal with toll bridges-----

The amendments deal with penalty points. I have been in this House a long time and recommittal is something unusual. It is only the second time since I became Leas-Cheann Comhairle that we have had one, having had one on a Finance Bill at one stage. The Business Committee will have to look at this. Members will recall that Report Stage was open-ended until the Business Committee decided that the first contribution should be seven minutes. Unfortunately, we are not on Report Stage and perhaps it is time for the Business Committee to look at time constraints. We are on Committee Stage at the moment and I have no control over that, except to say that a Member cannot wander beyond the amendments. There is a wide scope but the Chair is not responsible for the introduction of these measures. We may have a long way to go and we have to learn from this.

Otherwise it will be extremely frustrating. All our constituents, whatever their points of view, should be represented.
