#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the unrealistic rise of 40% in school transport charges which will adversely affect parents and pupils and place an untenable burden on families half way through the school year.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Having considered the matter, it is not in order under Standing Order 32.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	3	It is proposed to take No. 6, motion re the proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of a proposal that section 17A of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 shall continue in force for the period ending on 8 March 2009 — back from committee; No. 6a, motion re leave to introduce Supplementary Estimate — Vote 28; No. 6b, motion re referral of Supplementary Estimate — Vote 28 — to select committee; No. 12, Finance Bill 2008 — Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage; No. 13, Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007 — Order for Report, Report and Final Stages — to adjourn at 1 p.m. today, if not previously concluded; No. 13a, statements on World Trade Organisation.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 6 and 6a and, subject to the agreement of No. 6a, No. 6b shall be decided without debate and any divisions demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; (2) the proceedings on Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage of No. 12 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance; (3) the proceedings on No. 13a shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin who shall be called upon in that order shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	4	There are three proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 6, 6a and 6b without debate agreed to?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Nos. 6a and 6b are motions relating to the EU reform treaty.  Is the Tánaiste happy that €5.8 million will be sufficient for the business of the referendum commission?  On publication of the Bill, is it intended to establish the commission and announce the date for the referendum today?  
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	6	On the matter before the House, the Department of Foreign Affairs is seeking Dáil approval for a technical Supplementary Estimate to allow expenditure under subhead O of Vote 28, that is, in respect of the EU reform treaty, as Deputy Kenny said.  Subhead O involves a new service under Vote 28 and, as such, Dáil approval is required before expenditure is incurred.  A sum of €5.8 million will be sufficient.  The stablishment of the referendum commission is dependent on hearing from the Judiciary regarding the name of the proposed chairman.  The date of the referendum is not being announced today.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Deputy Timmins has made the point on a number of occasions that the information the commission presents should be as simple, relevant and understandable as possible in order that members of the public can be well informed before making a decision.  Will the information given by the commission to the public consist solely of facts, or will it give a direction on whether to vote yes or no?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	8	My understanding of the role of the commission is, as on previous occasions, to give an objective assessment of the arguments for and against in order that the people will understand the content of the treaty and the arguments in favour of adopting it.  In compliance with court judgments, it will give a balanced view.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 6, 6a and 6b without debate agreed?  Agreed.Is the proposal for dealing with No. 12, Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage of the Finance Bill 2008, agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I object to the debate on the Bill being guillotined.  I understand 15 amendments have been reached, while more than 40 have been submitted, some of which are very important.  Given the importance of the Bill and the issues to be discussed, the debate should not be guillotined.  I object to the proposal on that basis.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I object to the debate on the Bill being guillotined at 1 p.m.  Yesterday we debated a number of very important amendments.  However, the Minister introduced an amendment at the last minute on Monday to allow for the provision of tax breaks for investors in hospice care.  Hospice care in Ireland has traditionally been not-for-profit, voluntary and based on fund-raising and bequests.  This is a major change.  It may be an opportunity for the Government to complete its privatisation and two-tier health system agenda.  The guillotine allows no Opposition amendment to the Minister's late amendment, as there may not be an opportunity to debate it today.  This measure is a repeat of what the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, did five years ago on 5 March 2003 when, he later admitted, he had been lobbied by a doctor in his own constituency in respect of private day hospitals.  Every party and Member in this House wants to see the provision of more hospice care but it should not be to further the agenda of developing a two-tier health service.  We are seeing what has happened to women in Portlaoise as a consequence of the development of the two-tier service and we saw what happened to Susie Long.  Now people will not get the care and attention that may help them to survive, or even when they come for palliative care and pain relief or terminal care——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	12	We cannot have a debate on the Bill now.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	13	——it will now be privatised.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I object to the guillotine on the Finance Bill.  It is an interesting debate but at our current rate of progress we will not even get to the crucial amendment referred to by the previous speaker.  On the roll-out of this, just yesterday it was disclosed that land at Beaumont Hospital was gifted to private developers as well.  This was instead of developing a necessary psychiatric unit for people in this city and State.  I hope the Tánaiste will provide extra time for this important debate.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	16	We wish to conclude Report Stage today at 1 p.m. and we will put that to the House.  It is unfortunate the issue referred to by Deputy Burton is being portrayed in the way it is.  This is very much supportive of the hospice movement and it is a proposal supported by the voluntary hospice managers' association, which is involved in the hospice movement.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The Tánaiste knows we all support the hospice movement.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I take some exception to the idea that my motivation is other than to be supportive of the hospice and those who manage the hospice movement.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	22	In reply to the Tánaiste——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I must put the question——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	24	——this amendment only concerns investors or investment in private hospice development.  That is the wording.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 13a, statements on the World Trade Organisation, agreed?  Agreed. 
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I will not have the opportunity to speak on Report Stage of the Finance Bill 2008 but wish to refer to amendment No. 24.  We should not divide the country into regions according to death rates.  In respect of hospice provisions, the amendment states "not less than 20 in-patient beds".  There are hospices throughout the country with fewer than 20 inpatient beds.  We do not want a situation where a hospice in County Wexford or County Cork is approved but one in County Louth or County Offaly is not.  If the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance amended the amendment to state "more than 12 or 14 in-patient beds", it would be very beneficial and there would be equality across the board.  It would also give a sense of dignity and respect to those who are terminally ill and who must go into hospices.I understand that at the meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children a few moments ago, it emerged, and was confirmed by the HSE, that a letter was written by Mr. Peter Naughton to the Tánaiste's successor in the Department, the Minister, Deputy Michéal Martin, in 2002. The Irish Times sought evidence of such a letter under the Freedom of Information Act but it did not emerge.  Deputy Reilly asked the Minister for Health and Children in the Dáil if there was such a letter but she said not according to her information.  By confirming that such a letter existed and by making it public, it now appears that somebody tampered with this file which is evidence of an attempt to cover up a request for information made to the Tánaiste’s successor about a very serious matter in Portlaoise hospital.Political accountability should take place in this Chamber and I will request that time is allocated next week for a full discussion on this issue and the way it was handled.  This is too important for nobody to be blamed, for it to be considered a systems failure and for the buck to be passed again.  I will make a request, through our Whip, for a full scale debate on this issue because if somebody removed, covered up or altered that file or dictated that the evidence therein not be presented in the face of a freedom of information request by Deputy Reilly, it is scandalous and disgraceful and we need to find out the truth.  Political accountability should occur in this Chamber.I welcome the fact the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, or his office, has given an instruction to the Minister for Education and Science to sort out the problem in regard to autism.  If she agrees to sort it out, any announcement about a change in Government policy in regard to facilities for autistic children should be made in the House.  On three occasions in the past week, I have asked the Taoiseach to give me a report on the opening of the autistic unit at Castleknock Educate Together school.  The Tánaiste will be aware that this situation has arisen on foot of a difficulty that exists between the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children.  The child at the centre of this matter has been offered a place at a facility which is located two hours' journey from the family home.  That is an appalling response, particularly when one considers that said journey would have to be made through Dublin traffic.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I am anxious to allow other Members to raise matters.  I have given the Deputy a great deal of latitude.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	28	There is one further matter I wish to raise.  In the murder case that came to a conclusion before the courts yesterday, the presiding judge was constrained with regard to allowing the family involved to make a victim impact statement.  Is it the Government's intention to bring forward a legislative measure to ensure that victim impact statements could be made in cases of this nature?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I do not want to open a discussion on matters that will be dealt with in the context of the Report Stage debate on the Finance Bill.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I wish to comment on the same issue as that raised by Deputy Kenny.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Deputy Kenny raised a number of issues.  Perhaps Deputy Burton will allow the Tánaiste to reply before she poses her questions.  As already stated, I do not want us to engage in a debate on the Finance Bill.  Deputy Kenny requested a debate on issues that have arisen before the Joint Committee on Health and Children this morning and inquired about promised legislation in the form of an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act.  Perhaps the Tánaiste will comment on the latter two matters.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	32	When the Report Stage debate on the Finance Bill adjourned, we were on amendment No. 14.  There is no reason that we will not reach and debate amendment No. 24.  The issue is that there is a requirement to work in accordance with existing policy.  Pre-approval would be required from the HSE.  However, I will go into that in detail when Report Stage resumes.  This matter has been portrayed in an incorrect way and I do not know whether this was by mistake or on purpose.  I would welcome the opportunity to deal with it comprehensively on Report Stage.I am not aware of what is happening at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Deputy Kenny has drawn a rather extreme conclusion with regard to whatever has arisen at the meeting in respect of an item of correspondence.  I would not necessarily accept that what he said is the case.  It is rather premature to come to the conclusion reached by the Deputy.  The question of the business that will be taken in the House next week is a matter for the Whips.On the subject of autism, the Minister for Education and Science has done a great deal of work in respect of that issue and she continues to be committed to its development as part of the improved provision for special needs within the mainstream educational system.  The specific matter relating to Castleknock will have to be taken up with the line Department because I am not au fait with it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Is there promised legislation in the area of victim impact statements?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I am not aware of any promised legislation in that area.  Perhaps the Deputy could table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	35	On the various reports into breast cancer services at Portlaoise, Harry S. Truman had a sign on his desk which said "The buck stops here".  It appears that for the Government the buck stops anywhere other than on the desks of those who occupy the Front Bench.  Will the Government facilitate a debate on a motion by means of which we might seek to identify who was responsible in respect of this matter?  We encourage teenagers getting ready for later life to take responsibility.  Are those in Government just a bunch of teenagers who could do with some parental advice on taking responsibility for some of the messes over which they have presided?Saturday next is International Women's Day.  This is a sombre time.  What happened to the women at Portlaoise is upsetting for every female, particularly in the context of what it implies in the context of being tested and then receiving false positive or false negative results.  This is a difficult time for families throughout the country.  The idea that the Government is trying to skirt around this issue makes matters doubly difficult.Given the advent of International Women's Day, it is important to note that 138 women have been murdered — most of them, apparently, by their partners and husbands — since 1996.  Is the Government giving consideration to introducing legislation to allow the presentation of victim impact statements in cases where people have died——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	36	That question has already been answered.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	37	——or to bringing into being a harm-reduction strategy in order to reduce the number of murders of women?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Is there any legislation promised in this regard?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I am not aware of any such promised legislation.  I cannot comment on the case with which the courts dealt yesterday.  It is important that we should tackle these matters in the cold light of day and not in the context of the specific tragic cases being dealt with by the courts.  We should not say anything here which might impinge upon the independence of the courts' adjudication on these matters.  I am not aware of any specific legislation in this area.As stated earlier, I do not accept the precipitative and serious conclusion drawn by Deputy Kenny.  Such conclusions should not be bandied about in the House, particularly when one considers that discussions are ongoing.  It is, therefore, a matter for the Whips to decide what business will be taken next week.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	40	On a point of order, is the Tánaiste saying that the Government Chief Whip may proceed, in conjunction with the other Whips, to arrange a debate?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	41	That is not quite a point of order.  However, the Tánaiste may wish to reply.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	42	It is a very important point.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I will make the general and obvious observation that the ordering of business is usually dealt with through the Whips.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I welcome the publication of the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the purpose of which is to enable the State to ratify the Lisbon reform treaty.  The convention is that there would usually be a two-week period of reflection for the Opposition.  However, in view of the widespread concern that the House has not discussed this matter since the treaty was signed in Lisbon on 13 December, would it be possible to introduce the Bill on Wednesday or Thursday next in order that the debate on it might commence prior to the two-week Easter recess?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I welcome the support of some parties — particularly Labour and Fine Gael — in respect of the general thrust of the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  The work done by those parties' spokespersons with the relevant Ministers on the legislation is appreciated by the Government.On the urgent need for the debate to commence, I agree with Deputy Quinn that this is an important matter which requires, as soon as is practicable, the full attention and consideration of the House.  Having an unrestricted Second Stage debate in order that as many Members as possible might place their views on the record would be of great assistance to the wider public in the context not only of awareness, but also in respect of the general issues involved.  The expertise that resides on all sides of this House should be put to good use in such a debate.As already stated, the legislation should be dealt with as soon as is practicable.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be attending the spring European Council meeting next week.  It may, therefore, be difficult to arrange to commence the debate then.  I accept the motivation behind the Deputy's question, namely, to have the debate on the legislation begin within the Dáil as soon as possible.  It may well be that this matter will take centre stage in our deliberations in plenary session immediately after the recess.  The White Paper should be published by the end of the month and this will also help to inform the debate.

We were promised some time ago that the attachment of fines Bill, which would allow gardaí to be deployed on the beat as opposed to being obliged to collect fines, would be introduced.  Is it possible that this legislation, the intoxicating liquor Bill and the sale of alcohol Bill will be introduced in order that we might discuss that major issue?On the row between the pharmacists and the Government, when will the pharmacy (No. 2) Bill be introduced in order that we can discuss that important matter?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The Fines Bill is before the Seanad at present.  There is also the enforcement of fines Bill, for which there is, as yet, no publication date.  The intoxicating liquor Bill and the sale of alcohol Bill are expected to be taken during the course of this year.  I understand that no legislation is promised in respect of the other matter.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	53	That is not relevant to the Order of Business.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	61	What is happening with regard to the hospital?  We have people from——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I have called the Tánaiste.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The Leas-Cheann Comhairle should hold on for a second.  This is a very serious matter.  I do not stand in the House very often, unless I have a very serious matter to raise.  This is a serious issue.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Of course, it is, which is why it should be taken seriously.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Is there some other means of raising the issue?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Has the Deputy submitted a request to raise the matter on the Adjournment?
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I have.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	70	That is the way to deal with the matter.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle give me permission to raise it on the Adjournment?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	72	That will depend on how hard things are pushed right now.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	73	This is high priority.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	75	When will the Hanly report be rolled out?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Well done, Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Deputy Flanagan is not offering.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I am.  I was waiting for the cross-fire behind me to cease.In reference to the important matter raised by Deputy Kenny and in view of the Tánaiste's reply that the ordering of business is exclusively and entirely a matter for the Whips, the Tánaiste, as a constituency Deputy like me, must have some interest in the Portlaoise cancer issue.  The importance of having a debate on it is underlined by the fact that notwithstanding the three reports published yesterday, there is a black hole in this procedure——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	79	That point is understood.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	80	——namely, the absence of any reportage on the important role of the Department of Health and Children in this affair going back several years.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	81	It is not appropriate to raise that issue now.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I accept what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle says but notwithstanding what the Tánaiste said about the ordering of business, he might recommend to the Government Whip that he consider setting aside time for a debate on this issue next week.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I am sure the Tánaiste will have careful regard to what the Deputy is saying.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	84	It is urgent that we do this next week because the Dáil will be rising for a couple of weeks.  It is important given the widespread unease, that these issues be discussed.In reply to another Deputy the Tánaiste referred to legislation dealing with victims.  A victims of crime Bill was promised some time ago which must be on a B or C list.  Will the Tánaiste talk to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about bringing it from the C list to the A list because of its importance?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Minister will note the request made in the House regarding that matter.  The Bill is at an early stage of preparation.  I did not say it was up to the Whips to organise business; it is up to the Government to do so but we seek the co-operation of the Whips in bringing forward business in line with the Government programme.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The Tánaiste is always forthcoming.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I note what the Deputy has to say about the issue generally.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	88	As my constituency colleagues will readily testify, drive-by shootings have recently been introduced to the constituency.  In line with the issue I raised in the past couple of weeks, with the obvious increase in organised crime such that crime barons seem to walk about the country with impunity——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Does the Deputy have an appropriate question?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Deputy is wasting time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	91	He should hurry up.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I am coming to it.  There is a pile of relevant legislation but I want to set out what it is for.  It appears that there is ongoing intimidation——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	93	If the Deputy does not ask about legislation, I will move on.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	94	If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle allows me to finish this sentence——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	95	This is a long preamble.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	97	It will not.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	102	What legislation is the Deputy talking about?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I have raised the issue repeatedly in the past couple of weeks.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has evaporated from the House.  He was here but now he is gone.  I want somebody to address this issue as a matter of urgency and the Tánaiste is the most likely person to do it.  These are the Bills if the Tánaiste wants to know what they are: the criminal justice (confiscation of orders) Bill——

The Tánaiste is about to tell me it is not possible to indicate at this stage when it will be brought forward.  The list also includes the criminal justice (money laundering) Bill and the criminal justice (mutual recognition of financial penalties) Bill.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	109	That is a list of four criminal justice Bills.

Deputy Timmins has just handed me the referendum Bill, the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007.  It costs €50 billion on the current side to run the country.  Pages 6 and 7 of the Bill are entirely as Gaeilge, while pages 8 and 9 are entirely in English.  It is mixed up.  The Government will have to withdraw the Bill because nobody will read it or be able to understand it.

The Tánaiste has a responsibility to withdraw the Bill and have it put in proper sequence because it is not correct.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	117	The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, tells me that it is, in fact, correct.  When one brings forward a referendum Bill, one is required to translate exactly the English words into Irish and in an Irish version to translate the Irish into English.

This matter has been brought to my attention as a possible anomaly of which I was not aware on Committee Stage.  I should like the opportunity to get clarification from the Tánaiste on this point.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Does the Tánaiste wish to do that?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I oppose that.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20080	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I believe I am entitled to make a short statement.  The background to this is that it has been brought to my attention by a company which employs more than 500 staff, that unwittingly the Tánaiste has caught up bona fide arrangements to the effect that Irish-owned private concerns will be disadvantaged in providing opportunities to attract the best staff to do important work at the leading edge of the development of their companies.  There are genuine bona fide cases where these arrangements of conversion rights are organised — as they are in many other countries — and by moving to close a loophole, which has been abused, the Minister is unwittingly ruling out bona fide arrangements which have been used by private Irish companies.  It is worth being aware that the restriction to apply here does not extend to multinational companies, so it will only adversely affect private Irish companies.  As my amendment suggests, it is quite open to restrict the impact of this anti-avoidance measure to genuine abuses and to provide, as I have indicated, to allow bona fide cases, approved on an individual basis by the Revenue Commissioners, which would deal with the genuine instances where this method of payment is used, as in other countries, to incentivise highly qualified and very able managers.The downside of going ahead with this, according to the representation I have received, is that many companies will be forced to employ non-Irish people from outside the jurisdiction to do this type of work on behalf of developing companies and Ireland will unwittingly have shot itself in the foot.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	187	My reply to the Deputy is that there would appear to have been unapproved schemes going on without the knowledge of Revenue.  There are approved schemes, if employers want to incentivise employees, various employee share ownership trusts, ESOTs, for instance, save-as-you-earn share option and approved share option schemes, which enable this practice to be carried out on an approved basis.  I cannot accommodate unapproved schemes, which were not brought to the attention of Revenue, and about which it has some information at present.  These approved schemes are available to all companies which meet the necessary requirements, including Irish ones.  Such schemes must generally be available to all employees on similar terms.  The approved share option scheme, however, has some flexibility for key employees as regards the fact that similar terms rule and they can receive more favourable treatment.  Therefore if companies have a specific issue they want to discuss with Revenue, they can do so within the parameters of approved schemes, not ones they concoct themselves.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20080	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I move amendment No. 19:
In page 25, line 27, after "income" to insert "or capital gains".This is a largely technical matter.  I understand the EU Court of Justice challenged the treatment of income from the UK that Ireland had been in the practising of dealing with in a certain way.  There was a successful challenge to that.  Section 18, which deals with the tax treatment of certain possessions in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, addresses this issue.  We mended our hand following a challenge to the existing practice.It has been brought to my attention that the same weakness in our system exists in respect of the treatment of capital gains tax.  It appears the Government is moving to close the loophole in respect of the treatment of income tax but not the treatment of capital gains tax.  The point made to me was that if the weakness in respect of the latter is brought to the attention of the EU authorities, they will make a similar ruling, on foot of which we will have to make a similar adjustment to our tax treatment provisions.  We ought to mend our hand in respect of all cases equivalent to the one associated with income tax.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	189	It is the view of the Revenue Commissioners that it is only in the event of a complaint arising in respect of capital gains tax that it will deal with the matter on its merits.  We are dealing with the requirement covering income tax, as set out in the court opinion.  This change is as a result of a reasoned opinion and infringement notice from the European Commission in respect of income tax payable on UK-sourced income.  The Commission stated in particular that:Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 56 EC and Article 40 EEA by adopting and maintaining legislation which taxes the income on capital invested in the United Kingdom by persons who are not domiciled in Ireland, or being a citizen of Ireland, are not ordinarily resident in Ireland, while exempting such person's income from capital invested in other member States or in the EFTA/EEA States.The Commission invited Ireland to take the necessary measures to comply with its opinion.  The position was reviewed with the Revenue Commissioners and further legal advice was received from the Attorney General.  Section 18 is a response to the Commission's invitation and it ensures that we are now in compliance with the Commission's opinion on the matter.The proposed amendment would make a change to section 73 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended.  Section 73 is concerned only with income arising in the United Kingdom and the amendment will therefore have no effect on capital gains tax.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20080	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I did not quite follow the Minister's final remarks.  The case presented to me was that we have been found to have been treating income earned in the United Kingdom in a discriminatory way in the context of the rules that apply elsewhere in the European Union.  Our knuckles have been rapped on this issue.  The Minister is moving to mend our hand but he is taking an unduly narrow view of the opinion given that it is acknowledged on all sides that if the same issue arose in respect of capital gains, the same opinion would be issued.  In this case, the same view would be forthcoming from the court and the same response would be required of the Minister to amend the Finance Bill.  Why are we inviting those who feel aggrieved to make a new challenge before the Minister mends his hand and considering that he now knows the basis of the ruling?I did not interpret the Minister as disputing the case that the same opinion will apply in respect of capital gains.  If I believed the Government held the view that the opinion should not apply in respect of capital gains and that the Minister's defence was robust in this regard, I would be happy to agree with him, test the case and defend the Revenue Commissioners until this was done. However, unless the Minister has such a prima facie belief that he is in the right and that the Commission’s opinion would not apply to capital gains, we should put up our hands and amend our approach.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The view of the Revenue Commissioners is that a complaint should be dealt with on its merits when it arises.  Obviously, they see merit in contesting such a complaint.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20080	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Will the Minister articulate that merit?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Were it the case that circumstances developed as the Deputy suggests, the Revenue Commissioners might take a different view.  On the advice of the Revenue Commissioners, I have outlined the response to the Commission's opinion.  The Revenue Commissioners are of the view that, if and when a matter arises, it will be dealt with on its merits.  I have outlined the position as matters stand and will proceed according to the advice I have been given in this regard.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20080	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	194	We are the legislators, not the Revenue Commissioners.  They are entitled to their opinion but the Minister must persuade us that the validity of their opinion is such that we should not make my amendment.  To appeal to an authority outside the House that cannot present its case within the House is not good enough.  Either the Revenue Commissioners have a robust case that the Minister believes is strong and defensible or they do not.  If they did, we would be able to hold the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners, through the Minister, accountable in respect of that case.  I do not want to come back into the House only to find that the Revenue Commissioners were spoofing and that they were only trying to make certain taxpayers run through hoops to secure a decision that they, the Revenue Commissioners, believed in their heart of hearts would be secured in any case.What is the Minister's substantive case to back up the Revenue Commissioners opinion?  On hearing it, I will be quite happy to accept it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I have not heard the case suggesting that I should widen the scope of section 18, as suggested by the Deputy.  It is up to the Commission to make a case to change Irish tax law, and that is the advice I have received.  On the specific question as to whether I tested the implications beyond the scope of the amendment I received, the answer is that I did not.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20080	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I am disappointed.  I tabled my amendment in good faith and believed we could have an informed debate on it.  We in are in a position in which we do not have sufficient information and in which unaccountable people will tell us what to do.  This is not satisfactory.  The House is not being treated with the respect it deserves.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20080	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I accept that but those who compiled the Minister's brief should have provided him with an answer to my question.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I move amendment No. 20:

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I move amendment No. 23:
In page 30, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:23.—(1) Section 1041(1) of the Principal Act be amended by inserting the words "in respect of commercial property" in paragraph (a) after the words “Schedule D” and before the word “, or”.(2) Section 1041(1) of the Principal Act to be amended by inserting the words "in respect of commercial property" in paragraph (b) after the words “terms of the lease” and before the words “, but to a person other than the lessor.”.This amendment was proposed by my colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, of Cork South-Central.  I have already mentioned the matter to the Minister and will therefore be brief in the interest of providing time for amendment No. 24.  Under income tax law, tenants with foreign-based landlords are obliged to deduct the landlords' tax and remit it to the Revenue Commissioners when paying their rent.  A couple of difficulties arise in this regard.  Where foreign-based landlords are renting to tenants in Ireland, many of the tenants are not aware of the Revenue requirement and can be held accountable for not paying the tax that should be remitted to the Revenue Commissioners.As I stated to the Minister previously, there is a problem with the administration of housing allowances and rent supplements in respect of the HSE and county councils.  The policy in different local authority areas seems to vary.  Councils were supposed to be taking ultimate responsibly in respect of the rental accommodation scheme but the rate of roll-out has been very slow.  Under the existing arrangements, and as is the practice in respect of some rent supplements, if the HSE does not want to know who the landlord is and the landlord turns out to be based abroad, the HSE's client, who is paying the rent, has a duty to deduct the tax at source.  Very often the client does not know about this.A case arose in my constituency last year in which rent was being paid to a foreign-based landlord directly by the HSE.  The landlord, who was a doctor from the Indian subcontinent, had been living and working in Ireland but had departed.  The HSE was merrily paying away money by direct debit into the doctor's bank account.  Tax should have been deducted.  When the HSE decided to cut off the rent allowance, the tenant only found out several months later when the doctor had a look at his bank account and discovered he was no longer getting the regular payments.  The position in which some tenants find themselves where they have a liability under tax law to deduct the tax at source is an important issue, which I ask the Minister to address.  Some of the legal advice services have been dealing with this matter for various clients but to date no resolution has been found.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The Deputy's amendment seeks to confine the provisions of section 1041 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to commercial property only.  Section 1041 applies to all rental income and other lease income received by a non-resident in respect of property located in the State.  The section ensures that such income is taxed by requiring the tenant to deduct tax at the standard rate from the gross payment.  The tenant is then required to make a return and pay to Revenue the tax that he or she has deducted from the rent.  The landlord is entitled to a credit for the tax deducted by the tenant against his or her final income tax liability and is obliged to pay any additional tax that may be due.  By excluding property, other than commercial property, from the section the effect of the Deputy's amendment is to remove, without providing for an alternative, Revenue's ability to collect tax from rent paid to non-resident landlords for residential property.I accept that this provision as it is currently constituted might not be well known to tenants renting residential accommodation from non-resident landlords.  However, the provision does have a valid function in that if it was not on the Statute Book, it would be relatively easy for resident landlords to evade tax by establishing off-shore legal entities to hold their residential properties and to receive the rents due on these properties.  At present, section 1041 effectively prevents this type of tax evasion.  The removal of the requirement to deduct tax without providing for an effective replacement regime would only serve to open up opportunities for tax evasion.  While I am sympathetic to the thrust of the Deputy's amendment I am not in a position to open up opportunities to evade tax, nor does she intend to do so, and therefore, cannot accept the amendment.With regard to the question of reviewing this arrangement, I should point out that the operation and impact of the assessment and collection of taxes are monitored and are subject to review on an ongoing basis as part of the normal work of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners.  There are a number of factors that need careful consideration here, not least the need to protect the State from loss through tax avoidance and evasion.  As I have already stated, if I were to simply abolish the section, it would probably lead to structures being put in place to pay rents to off-shore entities, with the resultant loss to the Exchequer.  However, I will ask my officials, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, to review the issues to see if alternative arrangements can be put in place that minimise the risk of opening up opportunities for tax evasion.

I very much concur with the thrust of his argument.  The issue is to try not to create a liability for tenants who, through no fault of their own, become liable for a tax payment of which they, by and large in the ordinary course of business, would not be aware.I draw to the Tánaiste's attention my amendment No. 53, which I doubt we will reach, about landlords giving information on their tax numbers to the HSE and local authorities so that their tax issues can be pursued centrally and, if they are liable to pay tax, that they should be properly pursued for tax.  I hope the Tánaiste might come up with a change in the administrative arrangements which would benefit the Revenue Commissioners dealing with landlords in receipt of tens of millions in rent allowances, particularly from public bodies such as the HSE and local authorities.  People are correctly convinced that many of the landlords are avoiding taxes and have done so for years.  It is not beyond the wit of the Revenue Commissioners to put forward new arrangements which would tackle the issue at source.  I thank the Tánaiste for his reply.

This section comes into operation on such day or days as the Minister for Finance may by order or orders appoint and different days may be appointed for different purposes or different provisions.This amendment inserts a new section 25 in the Bill which provides for a new scheme of capital allowances for capital expenditure incurred on the construction and refurbishment of qualifying specialist palliative care units.  The scheme has similar terms, conditions and exclusions to those which apply in the case of qualifying private hospitals and qualifying mental health centres.There are gaps in the supply of and demand for palliative care facilities which vary from region to region.  I am putting this scheme in place to encourage private sector investment to fill some of those gaps but only where proposed developments of palliative care facilities are in line with the longer-term public health policy objectives in this area.  As with other similar schemes which I have reviewed in recent years, I will keep this scheme under review to ensure that it meets the requirements I have in mind for it.For expenditure to qualify under the scheme of capital allowances, the development of a facility must have pre-approval from the Health Service Executive — with the consent of the Minister for Health and Children — as being in line with national development plans and needs assessments for palliative care facilities.  Among other requirements, a qualifying facility must have a minimum of 20 inpatient palliative care beds.The HSE must also certify, on an annual basis for 15 years from first use, that a facility has satisfied the terms and conditions in the legislation.  A claw back of the allowances will apply if a facility is sold or ceases relevant use during this 15-year period.Relief for eligible capital expenditure incurred will be available at the rate of 15% per year in the first six years with 10% in year seven.  Eligible expenditure is net of any grants or other financial assistance received towards development costs.The restriction on the use of tax reliefs by high income individuals applies to investors who avail of capital allowances under the scheme.Approval from a State-aid perspective is required from the EU Commission.  Therefore, the scheme will come into operation by way of commencement order once that approval has been obtained.I reiterate the point I made on the Order of Business, that the motivation behind this is quite upfront and in keeping with the views of the hospice managers' association which is anxious that this facility be available, in addition to other efforts to source income through direct Exchequer issues or through voluntary fund-raising, which happens because of the voluntary hospice movement's strong support in all communities.Unfortunately, there are parts of the country which do not have up-to-date palliative care facilities.  There are palliative care facilities in various acute hospitals where beds are being made available, but in the south east, the north east and the midlands there are no specialist palliative care facilities.  There is a policy, a national plan for palliative care facilities, laid out in this area.  Obviously, this proposal is not to provide competition but to ensure that we bring forward these palliative care beds in line with HSE and departmental policy and the plans in situ.In no way is there any other motivation behind this other than to try to achieve it in the manner which, although not quite the same, was applied for private nursing home bed provision.  Large shortages were identified and tax relief for private nursing home beds came on stream with the resultant provision of up to 30,000 beds, if memory serves me correctly, in quite a short space of time.  I do not know where we would be in the nursing home area had we relied on public procurement provision solely to meet that demand within that timeframe.  I doubt very much we would have reached that complement.This is quite specific and quite limited and is in keeping with previous provisions.  HSE approval is required for it to be deemed a qualifying expenditure.  The contention that this is some effort to assist the construction industry is unfortunate.  This is not the point at all.  While I do not mind people having strong views on matters, I ask that they do not ascribe those sort of motivations to me.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20080	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	205	In principle, I welcome the amendment.  However, I wish to make a number of points in connection with it.  It is important when addressing health issues that we promote diversity of provision, a strong voluntary sector, a quality public sector and that we allow for private sector development.Another issue is access.  I am concerned that a large swathe of our provision will be based on the notion of access based solely on affordability.  It is a serious concern in respect of the hospice in particular, the culture of which is not access based on ability to pay but access based on need.  Against this background, the provision provides that 20% only will be public patients and 80% will be private patients.  I do not believe this is appropriate.  If, as the Minister says, this scheme will provide a new source of high quality hospice care, we should be planning that more than 20% of clients will be public patients.  What we want to promote is diversity of provision but equality of access.  We want to see more public patients getting access to facilities we support through a 42% subsidy under the tax code.  That we are providing a 42% subsidy but only 20% of clients will be public patients is something of an imbalance in this provision.  I hope that in practice, when hospice services develop under this provision, it will not be the case that 80% of clients will be those who can afford to pay and 20% will be people supported by the Health Service Executive.  This would not be in keeping with the tradition we have sought to promote within our health service.  It is a mixed health service but it is one that should be based on equality of access and, increasingly, that is not the case.  We have seen the erosion of this element in our care system.  All of us, as representatives, deal with constituents and are aware of the inequity of access to services for people dependant on the State to provide.  We should not be building into this legislation a provision that will become the mainstream of our provision in this area.I accept there is a national strategy in this area but I must confess I have not seen it.  The Minister should tell us more about it.  It is important to know to what extent our hospice service will be voluntarily, publicly or privately operated by way of tax incentivised provisions.  We want diversity of provision and fair access.  The context is all important.  I accept the Minister's point that this service would not be developed quickly enough in the public sector.  I have had personal experience of private sector nursing homes, some of which are run to the highest standards and wherein the culture is excellent.  However, as legislators, we cannot be unaware of the fact that people without the required expertise have entered the nursing home business as investors.Many important sections in this legislation provide that the HSE will ensure operators accord with national standards.  We cannot allow a repeat of the situation whereby inadequate standards were provided partially because those who entered the sector were motivated by tax incentives rather than a core commitment to the service.  The Minister is correct that many people involved in the voluntary hospice sector see this as a good vehicle for advancing their work.  Subject to the creation of the proper protections, this is a good scheme.As Deputy Kenny mentioned earlier, we have some concerns in respect of the decision to include a threshold of a minimum of 20 inpatient beds.  There is a desire to see smaller community-based hospices.  I do not believe we should be setting a threshold in this area.  As far as I am aware, the opinion of those involved in the hospice movement is that we are setting the threshold too high given successful models of hospice care closer to their communities will provide less than 20 beds.  Given the HSE powers in respect of approval and the level of oversight which the Minister assures us is being provided, I do not believe we need to insert an artificial ceiling that restricts it in this way.There are a number of other issues on which I would like clarification from the Minister.  The Bill provides for the disqualification of certain people from being beneficiaries including companies and those involved in hospice operations.  We can all understand why property developers are excluded.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify if this is a condition of State aid rules from the EU or if we are providing that people who run a hospice and are part of the hospice movement should be consciously excluded from being a participant in ownership of the facilities being incentivised.  Is this based on State aid rules to comply with EU requirements or our own decision?  I do not understand why in principle we would want to exclude people with a commitment to running hospices from being potentially involved as part owners and obtaining some benefit from this incentive.The 15-year rule which now applies was previously a shorter period having been extended by the Minister in previous years.  I am interested to hear the Minister's comment in this regard.  There are arguments for and against this.  We must ensure, in providing tax incentivised schemes of 42% tax relief that we are getting long-term commitment rather than short-term investment.  I am interested to hear the Minister's view on this and on what the HSE, in its national strategy, says about this rule.  Will the Minister continue to apply what appears to me to be a strange anomaly, namely, if the person obtaining the tax relief has rental income no ceiling will be applied in respect of benefit whereas a person with non-rental income will be restricted to €31,700.  Why do we continue to provide that those with a big rent roll can roll-over effortlessly into more of these tax incentive schemes while those who have earned income are capped?  If the purpose of this is the use of tax relief to promote the hospice movement and not to favour particular types of tax individuals, we should ensure there is a level playing pitch.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The hospice movement and hospice managers must accept what is available and on offer to them.  The Minister spoke about the HSE and the Department.  However, a policy directive from the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, states her desire for private investment in this area, as was the case in respect of co-location.  As I understand it, with the difficulties now being experienced in respect of the budgetary situation, only limited capital funding is on offer from the Government for hospice construction.  I attach no blame to anybody involved in the development of hospices.  I have been involved in fund-raising for hospices and have carried out work in connection with them over a long period of time.  I understand that if this is all that is available, it is better than nothing but let us make no mistake about it, the mechanism and manner in which the Minister has introduced this is wrong.He announced his budget in the first week of December.  We are now in the first week of March.  There was a long Committee Stage.  Press conferences and so on were held.  Briefings by officials in the Minister's Department about his thinking in respect of the Finance Bill were held.  Various organisations were able to lobby and give their views.We are now rushing in yet another amendment to a health policy dictated by the Progressive Democrats.  If people in the hospice movement wish to avail of this because it is the only thing on offer, that is fine and perfectly understandable.  Everybody in this Chamber wants to see more hospice provision, particularly more palliative care to deal with pain management for people with terminal illnesses.I said yesterday that I have considerable personal experience of dealing with this issue.  When I was a teenager, my mother was ill for three years.  Hospices and palliative care were not available then even for people in the extreme pain which she suffered.  Twenty years later, the home hospice palliative care movement had developed enormously for her older brother who did not have to die in the condition that she, unfortunately, did.  This is an important moral issue, as well as a practical issue, from the point of view of what we provide for people in extreme pain with terminal illnesses who need care.One of the problems with this debate, which is probably why so many Deputies have joined us this morning to debate it, is that the amendment states there should be a minimum of 20 beds.  This is probably fine for units in major urban centres like Cork, Dublin and perhaps Limerick.  However, it may discriminate against newly approved developments in the smaller centres.  This is why there should be a detailed debate about it.  Some of the Deputies here will be able to confirm whether this includes Castlebar, Tralee, Kilkenny, Drogheda, Cavan, Wicklow, Kildare and other areas.  Even larger units like Waterford, Tullamore and, in my own area, Blanchardstown, where there has been massive community involvement for the past seven years in trying to develop a hospice, could be affected.  Blanchardstown may have to develop in phases.  We now have the land after a long campaign.  This land was secured from the Government, for which we are very grateful.  There has been intense participation by the entire community there.It is very difficult to know why the Minister simply opted for that particular format and simply took the private hospitals provision, which was introduced by Charlie McCreevy five years ago who said he acted on foot of representations from a GP in his constituency with an interest in a private hospital.  As has happened with this amendment, the former Minister introduced this measure just before Report Stage.  We just spotted it in time.  The Minister did not notify us and we have not been given any opportunity to amend or discuss this.In respect of Deputy Bruton's point about how property developers and related persons, such as managers of hospices, are involved, I assume this is due to EU rules.  The draw for property developers is to get construction going.  They will make their profit on the construction and the investors will then make their profit and enhancement of their rent on the investment and tax breaks they get.As a result of my long connections with hospices, I am aware that philanthropy is not very extensive in this country.  There are many people who have made money but there are very few large-scale philanthropists.  Some people are involved in philanthropy and are to be commended on what they do but very few people who have made large amounts of money are involved in this area to the degree that people are in the US.The next point, on which there has, again, been no debate, strikes me as very odd.  There are a number of people in business who have given a considerable amount of time and resources to hospices, many of whom have been influenced by the death of children within their family circle or the circle of people they know.  They have been terribly generous and they know who they are.  Why could the Minister not have said that those kind of donations and bequests to hospices would be matched euro for euro by the Government?  That might be a much more attractive way of releasing money for the development of smaller hospice development about which we are talking in towns, particularly those in smaller rural areas.  There is a capacity there to release more funding to the hospices if the Minister had exercised some imagination and was not stuck on the Minister for Health and Children's ideologically driven, Progressive Democrat model which states that, at all costs, care in Ireland must be as privatised as possible even where people have terminal illnesses.My problem with this is that internationally the hospice movement has largely been a not-for-profit movement.  It is not just the development of beds in hospices that is important.  The really important factor is the development of palliative care where people only go into hospices for one night or a weekend but get pain relief and arrangements for this relief which make it possible to bring a degree of quality to the end of their lives and the lives of their families and those caring for them.The Minister may simply be acting on the instructions of the Minister for Health and Children but he is to be faulted for his lack of imagination and unwillingness to open out to the other parties in this House who would all have something to contribute.  Fine Gael, Sinn Féin and the Labour Party are here, as are many Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  We all want to contribute positively to the growth and development of the hospice movement and want to see the different areas and communities around Ireland being helped and facilitated.  We have no opportunity to amend or even to debate this.From a technical point of view, the fact that this relief is being introduced must mean that it is intended for hospices to rent the property, perhaps through sale and leaseback arrangements.  I do not know if this is the case so perhaps the Minister could elaborate on that.  Hospices would occupy these facilities as the bulk of the tax relief now available is for offset against rental income because of the caps on people who do not have significant rental income.  The traditional model has been for the hospices which are run on a voluntary basis to fund-raise and acquire and build the properties.  All the churches have played a part in the background with land.  In the case of Blanchardstown, the State recently played a role in terms of the provision of land.  The hospice in Raheny was built on land once owned by the Capuchin Friars, while the hospice in Harold's Cross was built on land once owned by the Sisters of Charity.  Most tax relief relates to the building costs rather than site costs so what will be the status of a property built on land donated or sold at below market rate by the church or other organisations for a worthy cause?  What are the issues relating to the Commissioners for Charitable Bequests and Donations?While the hospice need not be in private hands, a voluntary organisation can still rent the space it occupies.  There will be issues around the full market rent which investors will expect to receive because only by achieving the full market rent will they maximise their tax break from the hospice which is being given by the Minister in order to promote construction.There are also issues to do with the longer term ownership of the land and the implications this would have for a voluntary body.  If the State is effectively subsidising higher market rent in order to maximise the tax break for the investors, it would be interesting to see exactly where the net benefit to the State arises.  If the Minister is strapped in his capital budget, he may say it kick starts some building and he may say to hospice managers that some building is better than no building at all and this is an understandable argument.   If the development is designed to introduce a for-profit element into hospice care, then a debate is needed about the issues that require safeguarding, particularly when one considers the pain and suffering that many patients endure near the end of long illnesses and the ethical and other considerations that arise.  We do not want to hear stories of unnecessary pain and suffering similar to those we have heard coming from private nursing homes.  When the private nursing home provision was slipped in, the Labour Party warned that this would be attractive to people with an interest in development who were not necessarily experts in care and unfortunately this is how it has turned out to be.  Nobody wanted to see this happen but we have the history of what happened at Leas Cross.In order to gain tax relief, the investor will be obliged to hold the investment for a period of 13 years while the relief is over 15 years.  After this time they will wish to dispose of their interest in the property and in that scenario, when they want to dispose of the building, what are the implications for the hospice and its patients?  If I was on the board of one of the hospices, this would be done by a sale and a lease back with a reversionary clause and a nominal fee to the hospice.  However, who is to say?  There is no requirement in this legislation that the long-term interests of the hospice movement be protected.  We are relying on Deputy Mary Harney who will be gone in 13 years; if we have our way she will be gone long before 13 years.  What will happen then?I would be interested to see the nature of the arrangements that this legislation will spawn.  With the tax relief available for offices, potential tenants were offered a lease period equivalent to the tax life of the building with an option to buy at an agreed price when the tax life came to an end.  My guess is that this is what a lot of organisations might move to.  If similar arrangements develop with the hospital and hospice tax reliefs, what is the real benefit for the State with regard to the investment, other than start-up?  Would the State not be better off providing a grant directly to the hospice to purchase and build its property equivalent to the tax it will forego?  This would cut out the middle man who will in all likelihood wish to sell the property at full cost back to the hospice or the State at the end of the tax life of the investment.Whatever the Minister may argue, this section is all about the investor.  I refer to the Minister's provision in the amendment which also relates to current situations:(e) in relation to which an undertaking is given to the Health Service Executive—(i) to make available annually, for the palliative care of persons who have been awaiting day-patient, in-patient or out-patient palliative care services as public patients, not less than 20 per cent of its capacity, subject to service requirements to be specified by the Health Service Executive in advance and to the proviso that nothing in this subparagraph shall require the Health Service Executive to take up all or any part of the capacity made available to the Health Service Executive by the unit,I know of very good nursing home proprietors right around the country who have been in the business for a long time and who provide excellent standards of care.  They are not investors but have been involved in nursing home provision for a long time.  They have added additional units to take up the tax breaks and the incentives available and they have been advised by banks to do this.  However, they cannot get the HSE to commit to funding the packages for people waiting to leave acute hospitals.  I could take the Minister around the country and show him various homes which I have visited recently and where this situation has applied.  I remind the Minister that the national rate of private health insurance is about 53% but as I understand it, because incomes are lower along the western seaboard, the level of private health insurance is lower than in the eastern seaboard area.  If hospices are developed in the mid-west and west, what guarantee is there that the Health Service Executive will have any requirement under this amendment, to provide places for public patients?If this matter had been debated properly, we might have been able to agree a provision to increase the amount of hospice and palliative care available.  There are serious problems with the Minister's proposal.  The figure of 20 beds will create severe difficulties.  I refer to places such as Castlebar, Tralee, Kilkenny, Drogheda, Cavan, Wicklow, Waterford, the Minister's own area of Tullamore of which he will be aware, and Blanchardstown.  The plans of the hospice management group are not clear yet.  The State has given us the land.  The Minister for Health and Children wants to go back to her co-location plan which is driven by Progressive Democrats ideology.  I do not think it is driven by the thoughtfulness which I am aware is present in many Fianna Fáil people.

Every single extended family in my constituency has been touched in one way or another by cancer.  I do not want only those who are rich to be able to afford palliative care.  I do not want those people who are on very low incomes putting themselves into debt, in some cases serious debt, to try and buy proper palliative care for their loved ones in their last days on this earth.  This amendment is pathetic.I would have half expected such a proposal from the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats end of this Government but I am absolutely amazed and astounded that the Green Party has gone along with this proposal.  I am absolutely astounded that Independent Deputy Finian McGrath is going along with this proposal.  It is beneath contempt for the Greens and Deputy McGrath, who on many occasions sat on these benches and slated the Government for its policies over recent years.  Since 2003, when the then Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, brought in this gifting of taxpayers' money to these developers of private hospitals, we have had many debates.  Because of the public outrage over the scandalous notion introduced in 2003 I thought that would be the end of it.  I did not really expect it to come back again.  It is a mark of the arrogance of the Government that here it is yet again.  Here is more gifting developers with public money.  The Government is shovelling money over to private developers to provide an essential service that should be available as of right for our people.How much will this cost the Exchequer?  I am told the amount already given to developers for the development of private hospitals is unknown and unquantifiable.  Will the funds given under this provision be quantifiable?  Will any measures be put in place to allow us ascertain in 12 months or two years how much it will have cost the Exchequer?  I am told that is the position with what has happened already.  This money from the Exchequer should be retained to develop proper health care services for our people.Cancer patients are waiting for up to 18 months for an examination.  They cannot even have an examination to know how serious their condition is for a period of 18 months.  The Taoiseach tells us it is the consultants' fault and the doctors' fault.  As he is not a doctor it is not his problem.  He claims these consultants who are putting people on waiting list are responsible.  How pathetic is it to come in here and tell the House such nonsense?The Government and its predecessors have presided over ten years of an otherwise successful economy.  It claims credit for making it a booming economy.  I do not accept that.  However, I accept that a jackass could have run this company as well as that Government and its predecessors have done for the past ten years.  A jackass could have done what they did because they left no proper social infrastructure in place.  The health service has been in crisis for eight or ten years and the Government is doing nothing about it.  No proper public transport is in place and there are no proper education facilities.  I could take the Tánaiste to half a dozen facilities around my constituency that are falling apart and in need of renovation.  The Tánaiste thinks he and his colleagues have done a good job with this economy in the past ten years.  The biggest disappointment for me is that the Green Party and Independents are backing him in the endeavour he is proposing today.Yesterday we touched on the notion of social conscience and the Tánaiste came back to me, for which I am glad.  There is more social conscience in a cat's arse than there is in the entire Fianna Fáil parliamentary party.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	210	They might not have robbed banks, but they robbed the people and gave the bank owners the people's money.  That is what the Government and its predecessors have done over ten years now.  What else have they done?  They have presided over thousands of people dying on hospital trolleys and old people dying in their homes because of a lack of home support and a lack of proper help being given to those people to maintain their health and welfare in their homes.  What is the Tánaiste telling us?  There is no change in policy.  He obviously believes what he has done up to now is grand and perfect, and is continuing with it.  Tax exiles can declare they are tax exiles and walk away.  We know that a few years ago one character walked away with in excess of €36 million that was owed to the taxman.  Of course he walked off with that.This amendment represents an absolute scandal.  I agree there should be palliative care for people who need it and, God knows, we all know enough of them.  However, we do not want families going into debt.  If it is needed it should be paid for out of the public purse by the taxpayers who, I believe, would be happy to do so to ensure those people most in need of that care can get it in their last days on this earth.  I believe they are entitled to it and what the Tánaiste is proposing is an absolute scandal.  Why would I expect any different from a Tánaiste and a Government over this partial Parliament in this little semi-statelet over which he is presiding?  It is pathetic and the Tánaiste and the Government have had their day.I do not understand one matter to which the Tánaiste referred yesterday.  How did Fianna Fáil get the support it did in last year's general election, for which I commend it?  Yesterday I addressed the issue of how I believed it got that support, which was partially through its tax offers and scaring people on the economy.  By God, it is a mystery to me why people have not seen through the Fianna Fáil Party long before now.

It is nothing short of scandalous.The Dóchas centre in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is a one-stop shop for cancer patients, mostly women.  Last year 102 new patients presented in the centre.  It is regarded by people in the region who have used that service and by many of us who, luckily, have not needed to use it in any way, as a state-of-the-art facility.  However, the Government is withdrawing that service and shipping it up to Beaumont Hospital, an already overcrowded site.  It is going to be even more overcrowded because the Government has changed its mind and is taking away the long-promised psychiatric unit and allowing private developers to build a co-located hospital.  The Government is happy with that and is standing over it in the belief that it is acceptable.  I do not believe it is acceptable — it is disgraceful.Regarding the Dóchas centre, many breast cancer patients need to pop into hospital for a minor procedure that may last for five or ten minutes.  There was almost no queuing and patients were in and out in a few minutes.  With the removal of that service to Dublin, those patients will need to travel to Dublin and sit in a queue for several hours that would have only taken a few minutes in their home town.  That is what the Government is presiding over.  I am amazed at the brass neck of tabling such an amendment again.  We all want palliative care to be available.  It should not be available only for the rich.  Poor families should not need to put themselves into debt to buy it or else do without it.  The Tánaiste should withdraw his amendment immediately.

I compliment the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance on his innovative proposal regarding the further provision of hospice or palliative care.  The banner headlines achieved by Deputy Burton have been somewhat subdued today given that representatives of the hospice movement have now endorsed the proposal.  All those with whom I have consulted welcome it very much.  I have been in close contact with the hospice movement over the years.Regarding the outburst and breaking into a sweat by Deputy Morgan, if it was not for him and his fellow travellers we would have had considerably more money to invest in many projects over the years instead of needing to spend it on security to protect the State.

It opposed our entry into the European Economic Community and every treaty.  It is all no, no, no and being critical.  That is the extent of its contribution to the State.  We needed to spend hundreds of millions of euro to protect the State against its activities.There are important issues regarding the hospice movement.  I agree with Deputy Burton that some people have provided wonderful facilities over the years.  We compliment them on this.  The Bill provides a further opportunity to provide additional and extended hospice and palliative care in many locations.  To date, many have become benefactors to the hospice movement and they, too, are to be complimented.  They are appreciative and supportive of the movement and I acknowledge their efforts, especially in my region.While this measure offers a further opportunity to provide extra services, I am concerned about the 20-bed limit which could reflect negatively in my area.  I have discussed the matter with Deputy Calleary as we are both affected.  Castlebar hospital is to have a 14-bed hospice unit, while Roscommon County Hospital will have an eight-bed unit.  Collectively, that makes up 22 beds.  The Roscommon hospice movement is providing the service, albeit at two locations.  Where such a body provides services at two locations, it should be seen as constituting a 20-bed plus development.  I make that simple suggestion in the interests of fairness and hope the Minister and his officials will be in a position to accept the idea.There have been some bad cases concerning nursing homes but, as Deputy Bruton said, so many people are providing wonderful care in nursing homes.  The disgraceful things that happened at a couple of locations cannot and will not be allowed to recur.  I hope the HSE now has an inspection system in place to prevent such a recurrence.The amendment states proposals for capital allowances for palliative care units must first be approved by the HSE.  By and large, I welcome the Minister's proposal and he is right to introduce it at this time.  I am glad to see that there is broad agreement on it, although I am not surprised that some individuals and parties may have their own views.  It is important to provide hospice care.  We must avail of any opportunity to provide extra space, beds and units.  There is now such an opportunity and the Minister should be complimented on availing of it.  His predecessor, Mr. McCreevy, was responsible for providing some 30,000 extra places by taking a political decision to support the private nursing home sector.  We would not have those places if he had not taken that decision.  The same initiative is being shown now thanks to the Minister's innovative proposal.  I commend the amendment to the House.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I endorse everything Deputy Finneran said and welcome the amendment.  It is not for property developers — despite the usual phrases thrown around — but for the provision of beds and to encourage benefactors.  Deputy Finneran outlined the proposal by the Mayo-Roscommon hospice which has been approved by the HSE.  This document will require prior HSE approval; therefore, under this legislation there will be no recurrence of incidences that happened in the private nursing home sector.  The conditions the HSE imposes on hospices are rigorous.  Everyone who works with the hospice movement knows the standards of care involved.Deputy Finneran mentioned that 14 hospice beds were being provided in Castlebar and eight in Roscommon.  They are being provided simultaneously and lot of work and planning have gone into their provision.  Given that the board of management of the Mayo-Roscommon hospice is in charge of both facilities which are being developed together and owing to the unique nature of the combined structure of the hospice movement in both counties, the proposal should be considered as encompassing a 22-bed development.  The benefits under this arrangement should be applicable to it.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	221	While I welcome the general thrust of the amendment, it is disappointing that we only received it a couple of days ago.  I find it difficult to understand why it was not introduced prior to Committee Stage in order that we would have had time to debate it properly and examine its various elements.  I agree with all the comments made about the hospice movement.  We have the renowned Milford hospice centre in Limerick which provides a brilliant service.  Probably everyone in the region has a family member or friend who has availed of that service.I wish to deal with a couple of points concerning the amendment.  The Minister referred to section 3(c)(ii) which requires a minimum of 20 inpatient beds.  Deputy Bruton also referred to this point but why is there a minimum limit?  Under the terms of the Nursing Homes Act 1990, a person can qualify for a nursing home place as long as he or she has more than two dependants.  Equally, the 1998 legislation on private convalescent facilities contains no stipulation on the number of beds required.  The only stipulation concerning housing units for the aged or infirm is in the Finance Act 2002 which provides for a minimum of 20 units but that is in a different context because this amendment concerns palliative care units.  The Minister should re-examine the section with a view to allowing each application to the HSE to stand on its own merits; otherwise we could have a situation where parts of the country will lose out, depending on the size of units involved.  Why should some people be disenfranchised because they have access to a 12-bed rather than a 20-bed unit?  I cannot understand why it is necessary to set such a limit when it does not apply to nursing homes.  The Minister should consider this point.Section 3(e)(i) refers to the need for 20% capacity for public patients.  However, I agree with Deputy Bruton that this figure is too low.  We want to provide a service with equal access for all.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to review this section and perhaps table an amendment to permit a higher level.  My understanding is that if he so wishes, he could allow oral amendments to be discussed today.  This should be done in the interests of putting something in place that would work for both public and private patients.  The Minister should insert the same eligibility provisions that apply to nursing homes, which refer to a person with two dependants.  This would require a change to section 3(c)(ii).Deputy Burton mentioned rents and said this measure was being driven purely in terms of investment.  When applications are being made to the HSE, it is critically important that there be no restriction on supply.  If, for example, the HSE states it will only give approval for one unit in a particular area, that may lead to a monopoly.  In a situation where there is more than adequate supply, the service must be community based.  There cannot be a situation where it is available in one community but not in another.This particular amendment cannot be implemented unless the commencement order is in place, for which approval from the EU is required.  I have raised this issue before.  How long will it take to secure that approval?  It is critical that it is implemented as quickly as possible.It is a pity that we have not had adequate time for this debate and that it will be guillotined in 15 minutes.  This is critical legislation that affects people's everyday lives, but it is being rushed through.  I ask the Minister to take on board our proposal to omit any stipulation in regard to the number of beds, as is the case in respect of nursing homes, increase the 20% threshold for public patients and ensure there is no restriction on supply.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this amendment.  Deputies Bruton and O'Donnell highlighted a weakness in the amendment in respect of the 20-bed threshold.  Deputy O'Donnell made the valid point that there is no such limit in regard to nursing homes.  There is an inherent protection in the amendment in that it requires the approval of the Health Service Executive for a project to go ahead.  It is not a question of units being developed at every crossroads.  It is extremely difficult to secure HSE approval.Deputies Finneran and Calleary referred to projects in Roscommon and Mayo.  An eight-bed unit is being developed in Roscommon and a 14-bed unit in Mayo.  These projects would not have commenced without the commitment of the Mayo Roscommon Hospice Foundation, which was obliged to commit the largest percentage of the capital funding.  After much arm twisting, the HSE eventually approved the projects but only on the basis that the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation would pick up part of the initial running costs.  We still have no decision from the HSE in regard to the ongoing running costs, and this is holding up the projects.  Premature announcements have been made in regard to this funding but I hope the HSE will finally sanction it as soon as possible.This amendment will not facilitate the projects in Mayo and Roscommon, for which the bulk of the capital funding came from the voluntary sector and the public.  Moreover, as I said, most of the funding for the initial running costs of both operations also came from voluntary contributions.  It is important that we recognise and support the tremendous work being done by hospice groups throughout the State.  The Government must not turn its back on these projects.I am concerned that the reason for the imposition of a 20-bed threshold is some type of hidden agenda in the implementation of the national cancer care strategy.  The location of the proposed centres of excellence means there will be no services north of a line from Dublin to Galway.  The 20-bed threshold proposed by the Minister would restrict the provision of palliative care facilities to large population bases of approximately 200,000 to 250,000.  This means that counties with smaller populations will never have the opportunity to avail of these provisions.  The Minister and I both come from counties with small populations so I assume that is not the agenda behind this proposal.  I ask him to reconsider this provision on the basis that the current proposal will only facilitate large catchment areas and population centres.  We see the impact this has already had in respect of the centres of excellence, with counties like Mayo and Sligo left out of the loop.Another issue is the percentage breakdown of public and private patients, the so-called 80:20 split.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that this represents a total imbalance.  The ethos behind the hospice movement is that everybody should be treated equally according to need, not on the basis of the health insurance cover they may have.  That is even more so the case in Mayo and Roscommon where a significantly lesser percentage of the population has private health insurance.  The objective of the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation is to ensure the eight-bed and 14-bed units are available to everyone regardless of health insurance cover.  I ask the Minister to review this aspect of the proposal.Deputy Bruton referred to the monitoring of standards.  It is totally unacceptable that private hospitals, some of which have already availed of various supports and incentives provided by the Government in regard to sites and so on, do not come under the jurisdiction of any type of monitoring agency.  This is a national scandal.  It is fundamentally important that these facilities are placed under the supervision of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Likewise, palliative care facilities must also be subject to independent monitoring via the HIQA.  The service provided by the hospice movement throughout the State is excellent.  There has never been a complaint about the quality of service provided by the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation.  However, there have been incidents in other areas where disputes have taken place, facilities have lain idle and so on.  That must not be allowed to recur.  It is important that this protection is put in place.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	223	There are also ethical issues in regard to pain relief and near death situations.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Yes, there are serious ethical issues in that regard over and above the monitoring required of the standard level of care.  Every Member regularly receives complaints about the operation of the health service, particularly in respect of acute hospitals and nursing homes.  In most cases, nothing is done to address these complaints.  I hope the establishment of the HIQA will bring a change in this regard.  It is of fundamental importance that such protection is in place for the people who use these facilities.I urge the Minister not to ignore the tremendous work being done by the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation, an organisation that put its neck on the line in getting the projects in Mayo and Roscommon off the ground.  It experienced great difficulty in securing HSE support before the latter eventually provided sites for the two projects.  I am concerned that a situation will arise where this particular incentive is focused on large population centres to the detriment of smaller community facilities.The objective of palliative and hospice care is to keep the services as close as possible to patients and their families.  The Government and the Health Service Executive are taking an alternative view of regional acute hospitals, with smaller hospitals and accident and emergency units being closed and centres of excellence established.  It would be wrong if the hospice movement and palliative services were forced down the same road.  The Minister is facilitating that development.  I do not believe that is the Minister's intention and I urge him to re-examine this amendment and re-draft it to facilitate smaller projects like those in Roscommon and Mayo.

Like Deputy O'Donnell, my experience is principally of the Milford Hospice, which is an excellent one.  I do not know its bed capacity but it is certainly greater than 20.  Hospices are different from private nursing homes.  They have a particular focus.  I have enormous admiration for the work of the hospice movement.I was interested to see in yesterday's Evening Herald a socially progressive commentator welcoming the Minister’s measure as having considerable potential and providing relief for the hospice movement.  Therefore, we should not look at this measure through ideological spectacles.  I accept that units need a certain critical mass but, like Deputy Finneran, I believe that requirement should be interpreted and implemented in a flexible manner——

Similarly, the 80:20 ratio of private to public patients could be taken in the context of existing provision because the balance in the health service as a whole is not far from 50:50.  We have, for better or worse, a hybrid health system which encourages people who can provide for themselves to do so.  One might argue against that but it was settled 50 or 60 years ago.This is an excellent use of tax breaks.  I see absolutely no incompatibility with long-standing Fianna Fáil policy.  I can well imagine that it would be introduced, regardless of who our partners in Government were.  There is a certain allergy in parts of the House to the very notion of private profit but our whole mixed social market economy operates on that basis.Very crude criticisms were made of the Government's economic policy by a party which does not have any coherent economic policy that I am aware of.  I was shocked, although not surprised, to hear any Deputy refer to this as a partial parliament in a semi-statelet.  I have always had great difficulty understanding so called republicans who do not recognise this Republic.  It throws into context the party in question's presenting itself as the champion of sovereignty and democracy when it is clear that the Deputy opposite does not recognise the sovereignty of either this State or its people.  The European Union in the past 35 years has had much more respect for sovereignty and democracy in this country than the party opposite.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I fully support the principle behind what the Minister is trying to achieve.  However, a hospice is not similar to a nursing homes or private hospital.  The hospice movement allows people to spend the last days of their lives in a different atmosphere.  Patients do not spend long periods in hospices, unfortunately, and they know their days are numbered.  Therefore, the more local the hospice, the better.  It is important that patients remain in their own environment, visited by friends from their own locality.  Those qualities of the hospice movement should be protected.  Therefore, I fail to see why the Minister has imposed a minimum size, as though a hospice were a commercial enterprise similar to a private hospital.  Health Service Executive approval should be sufficient to protect the purpose of the tax break.The tax breaks should be project based.  This is the point being made by the Deputies for Roscommon and Mayo.  In my own area, the Blackrock Hospice is regarded as a project.  People whose relatives have died in the hospice have an opportunity to give something back to it.  Tomorrow is Daffodil Day.  The lifting of the restrictions proposed by the Minister would be a wonderful present from the House to the hospice movement.

Where patients have private health insurance, the health insurance company is billed directly for accommodation costs in the specialist inpatient unit. Both public and private patients are seen by the consultant in palliative medicine.  All consultations with the consultant in palliative care are delivered free of charge to public patients.  Consultations with private patients incur a charge billed directly to the private insurance company.A baseline study undertaken by the Irish Hospice Foundation found regional variations across the country in the provision of hospice specialist palliative care services.  In particular, there are apparent gaps between supply and demand in a number of locations.  There are 131 external beds in hospices and specialist care units against a recommended level of 390.  This represents a deficit of 259.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to removing the regional disparities in the provision of funding for palliative care, ensuring that the needs of all those who require palliative care are met.Legislation requires the pre-approval of any proposed development in this area by the HSE with the consent of the Minister for Health and Children.  The 20 beds issue arises from discussions with the Department of Health and Children to ensure the long-term feasibility of units.  Population size and catchment area recommendations in various reports are for eight beds per 100,000 of population.  This is a minimum level to ensure that units develop in accordance with policy for this area.  With regard to the specific issue raised by Deputies Finneran, Calleary, Naughten and others, if a project receives approval from the HSE, from a tax point of view the same company running both facilities with an aggregate figure of 20 beds could qualify for relief.  It is a matter of obtaining prior HSE approval in the first instance.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I very much welcome this opportunity to address the House on the ongoing WTO negotiations.  As a small open economy, Ireland has much to gain from the rule-based multilateral trading system provided by the World Trade Organisation and the current round of negotiations presents both challenges and opportunities for all of the major economic sectors in Ireland, in particular the services, agriculture and manufacturing sectors.Negotiations on trade liberalisation have been with us for many years.  Up until 1995, the rules were largely ineffective in controlling trade in agricultural products.  However, the 1995 Uruguay Round changed all that and agriculture trade is now firmly within the multilateral trading system.  The Uruguay Round, which distinguished between the forms of support on the basis of domestic support, export subsidies and market access and committed member countries to specific reductions in each, was a significant first step in disciplining agriculture in a meaningful way.  At the same time, the Uruguay Round struck a balance between agricultural trade liberalisation and member countries' desire to pursue legitimate agricultural policy goals.Agriculture continues to make an important contribution, economically and socially, to Irish society and the outcome of negotiations on the new WTO agreement on agriculture will be a crucial for us.  Indeed, agriculture will have a critical role in determining the final outcome of the round.The outcome of the current negotiations will determine the maximum levels of protection and support which will apply to the agriculture sector in the future and given that the process of liberalisation will be significantly more advanced, the negotiations represent a real challenge to the future of EU and Irish agriculture.The negotiations were launched at the WTO Doha ministerial conference in November 2001 under a very ambitious mandate for trade liberalisation.  In so far as agriculture is concerned, the Doha mandate provides for substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support, reductions in, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidy and substantial improvements in market access.  Substantial reductions in tariffs, domestic support and export subsidies are, therefore, prominent issues in the negotiations.We in the European Union have prepared responsibly for these negotiations.  Indeed, recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy were deliberately designed to position the EU to contribute to a successful outcome of the round.  The Agenda 2000 reform, which continued the process of reform launched by Commissioner MacSharry in 1992, provided for further cuts in institutional price guarantees with compensation for farmers through direct payments.  Further progress was made in the radical reform in the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy which was agreed in June 2003.The decision to decouple payments was a major step in fulfilling the Doha target of substantially reducing trade distorting domestic supports.  Decoupled payments, which by their nature are not linked in any way to production, are considered non-trade distorting by the WTO and qualify for the so-called "Green Box" category of payments and it is most important that this should remain the case.  The EU move away from coupled payments and the gradual reduction in the more conventional market support measures, such as intervention, have reduced very substantially our levels of trade-distorting supports, thereby enabling the EU to face into the negotiation from a position of strength.I will review briefly the progress of the negotiation since the launch in Doha.  In reality, little progress was made until the conclusion of a framework agreement in August 2004.  Prior to that, the negotiations were marked by failure to achieve consensus as in, for example, the collapse of the WTO ministerial conference at Cancun.  The framework agreement of August 2004, which set out the structure and content of the new agreement, represented a significant breakthrough.The Hong Kong ministerial conference in December 2005 provided a further stepping stone towards the conclusion of the round, with agreement on a number of issues in particular key development matters.  Since then, however, the negotiations have stumbled along, with a serious of missed deadlines and the full suspension of negotiations in the summer of 2006.  Although negotiations fully resumed in early 2007, further efforts to conclude the round have, to date, failed.It is no secret that since the Hong Kong ministerial conference I have been dissatisfied with the direction of the negotiations and with the negotiating strategy adopted by the Commission.  There has been an insistence by the negotiating partners that they would not engage in meaningful negotiations on other issues until substantive progress has been made in respect of agriculture.  As already stated, the Doha mandate covers a broad trade agenda and it is not acceptable that concessions in agriculture should be a precondition for movement elsewhere.  Agriculture is vitally important to the livelihoods of millions of farm families in developed and developing countries and they should not be sacrificed for the sake of an overall WTO agreement.  I am disappointed that the same commitment to securing an agreement has not been shown by many of the other developed countries among the negotiating partners which continue to put the EU under pressure on agriculture.  In contrast, the efforts made by the EU as a whole in preparation for the negotiations clearly show its commitment to achieving an ambitious outcome.I have also been concerned that the Commission has been adopting an unnecessarily concessionary approach to the negotiations.  The Commission negotiates in the WTO on behalf of the member states on the basis of a mandate which was agreed by the Council of Ministers.  The mandate is designed to defend the CAP as it has evolved under successive reforms, including Agenda 2000 and the mid-term review, both of which were agreed with a view to positioning the EU in the WTO negotiations.  Essentially, the Council mandate aims to protect the European model of agriculture as an economic sector and as a basis for sustainable development based on the multi-functional nature of agriculture and the part it plays in the economy, the environment and society in general.I wish to update the House on the latest developments in respect of the negotiations.  The chairs of WTO agriculture and non-agricultural market access, NAMA, negotiating committees issued new draft texts of so-called modalities — essentially drafts of the detailed elements of an agreement — on 8 February.  As already stated, I have not been happy with the direction of the negotiations and these latest draft texts have not done anything to allay my concerns.I am deeply worried by the suggestion that the EU should provide further concessions on a range of agriculture issues, particularly the level of tariff reductions, the treatment of sensitive products and the related tariff quota expansion.  At the same time, the text on market access for industrial goods does not provide the foreseen additional market opportunities for EU goods.  This would create a greater imbalance in the negotiations, with a further disproportionate burden being borne by EU agriculture in order to achieve what I consider to be a bad deal.  This is not acceptable.  There would be a direct and serious threat to the continued viability of many elements of EU agriculture in the face of some aspects of the latest market access proposals.As stated earlier, my view is that the CAP reforms which have already been implemented represent a very significant contribution to these negotiations——

We must achieve genuine balance in any final agreement.  Crucially, the European agrifood sector must not be sacrificed for the sake of a deal.  This is the position consistently taken by the Government and it will continue to be strongly reflected at various EU and WTO meetings.  My colleagues in Government, my officials and I have taken every opportunity to make our concerns clear to the EU Commission in bilateral contacts and at meetings of the EU co-ordinating groups in Geneva, the Article 133 committee, the Agriculture Council and the General Affairs and External Relations Council.This is not just an Irish concern.  I have been engaged for several years in a continuous process of encouraging and cajoling other member states to join Ireland in its strong stance on this issue.  I have also been pressing the Commission, both at the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in direct bilateral meetings, to stiffen their backs in the negotiations.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has played a similar leading role at the General Affairs Council.  Like his predecessor, Deputy Michael Ahern, the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, has also been active in this intensive effort on the part of the Government.  The Taoiseach has taken every opportunity to put forward our case at the very highest level in Europe.  This has been a signal to others both of the importance of this issue to Ireland and the need for engagement at the highest levels by European Governments in respect of this matter.We have also established an alliance with a group of over 14 EU member states and there is good support for the view that the legitimate interests of the EU agrifood sector must be strongly defended.  At the latest Council meeting the membership of the group of 14 swelled to 20.  Of course, each member state has its own particular concerns.  While Ireland focuses on the "Green Box", export refunds and market access for beef and dairy products, others are, for example, concerned about Mediterranean products.  However, such broad alliances are crucial in an EU of 27 member states.The Government's intention is to continue these contacts with other member states and directly with the Commission.  This process has been particularly intense in recent times.  That will remain the case in the coming months as the WTO Director General, Pascal Lamy, has indicated his intention of calling a ministerial meeting in 2008, with a view to finalising the modalities of an agreement on agriculture and NAMA.  The timing of this ministerial meeting is as yet unclear, although dates in April, May, June and even July have been mentioned.  The timing is very much dependent on the progress that can be made to resolve the large number of technical issues that remain outstanding.In recent weeks, intensive discussions have taken place in Geneva on the texts.  However, there are still many technical, as well as political, issues that have not been resolved.  The possibility that further texts might issue from the agriculture and NAMA chairs, before discussions move to a horizontal process at senior official and political level, has not been ruled out.It is not only the timing of the ministerial meeting that is in doubt.  A number of WTO members have outlined their opposition to dealing only with agriculture and NAMA at a ministerial meeting and have emphasised the need for progress on other elements of the WTO negotiating agenda such as services, rules trade facilitation, etc.  This is in line with the WTO principle of a single undertaking in the negotiations, whereby nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  It is, therefore, unclear at this stage which issues would be addressed at a ministerial meeting.  If agreement were to be reached on agriculture and NAMA at this time, the suggestion is that, in the period needed to produce detailed WTO schedules, the other areas of negotiation would be concluded so that the final overall agreement would be in place by the end of 2008.As to the prospects for an agreement this year, it is very difficult to call.  In addition to the large number of complex issues across the broad spectrum of negotiating areas that are unresolved, the uncertainty in the US political situation will play a crucial role in whether this proposed timetable for reaching a final agreement is achieved.  We must assume, however, that regardless of whether a WTO agreement is concluded this year, sooner or later there will be an agreement.  It is important, therefore, that we prepare ourselves for this.  Irrespective of the precise substance of such an agreement, it will present significant challenges for the Irish food industry and for the beef sector in particular.As the negotiations continue, and while I am committed to a successful conclusion to the round, I assure the House that the Government is determined to ensure that EU agriculture will not be sacrificed for the sake of an agreement.  There must be an equitable agreement which will deal with all elements of negotiation.  Ireland and the EU must secure an agreement that will ensure continued economic development.  Therefore, my overriding objective is to ensure that the CAP reforms, which have already been implemented and which represent the limit of the EU mandate in these negotiations, are not undermined.  I will continue to argue this point forcefully in the negotiations.I have a number of specific priorities in respect of the ongoing agriculture negotiations.  On domestic support, I aim to ensure that the system of decoupled direct payments continue to qualify as non-trade distorting payments under the WTO "Green Box" classification and so remain exempt from reductions under the new round.  There can be no question of the decoupled single farm payments being undermined by any WTO proposals for reviewing the "Green Box".  This is a clear red line for the Government which cannot be crossed in the negotiations.On export subsidies, we want to ensure the full parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidy, while seeking the maximum flexibility in the phasing out arrangements for the EU export refunds scheme.  On market access, it is vitally important that Irish and EU farmers have sufficient time to adjust to CAP reform and, in particular, the impact of the introduction of the decoupled payment system.  An effective import regime has a vital role to play.  Therefore, my aim is to retain a realistic and effective level of protection for our producers and exporters.  As to non-trade concerns, with others, I have repeatedly drawn attention to the importance of this issue and, in particular, the fair application of equivalence in sanitary and phyto-sanitary protection.  I will continue to raise this issue in the context of the WTO negotiations and elsewhere.It is regrettable that other negotiating partners are focusing on pursuing further concessions from the European Union without sufficient reciprocal movement on their part.  The European Union cannot be blamed for the current difficulties in the negotiations because we have made significant contributions to the round.  Other developed countries and the more economically advanced developing countries must step up and deliver if an ambitious Doha Round which will benefit the poorest countries is to be achieved.  I will continue to have an active role in the ongoing negotiations and will vigorously pursue the key objectives I have outlined.  I will also continue to work closely with the Commission and other like-minded member states to secure a balanced agreement which will benefit Ireland.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I welcome the opportunity to address this issue and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Crawford, on seeking this debate last week.  We do not often have an opportunity in the Chamber to sing from the same hymn sheet in respect of the national interest.  There is very little with which I disagree in the objectives the Minister has set out but I have serious reservations about the prosecution of those objectives and how the campaign is being fought.  I envy the Minister in terms of the backup resources and advice at her disposal.  I am grateful to officials in her Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for their recent briefing.  They are a fine bunch of officials and 100% committed to pursuing the optimum objective, the best deal for Ireland.  I invite anyone who has not considered this matter in detail to visit the WTO website, to note the impressive jargon and terminology which could almost fill another edition of the Collins English Dictionary.In my early days in the House in the 1990s the GATT Round and the Uruguay agreement dominated agricultural policy.  The Doha Round presents the greatest threat to Irish agriculture since that time and requires great vigilance.  World trade agreements are good for our small open trading economy because of their aversion of bilateral agreements.  The success of the economy has been largely built on its ability, by virtue of world trade agreements, to attract international or multinational companies to locate here and the explosion in internationally traded services in organisations such as Google.  No agreement is preferable to a rushed agreement or one that compromises our single biggest sector, agriculture.  We also have an obligation to defend the Common Agricultural Policy in the European Union.The merry-go-round from Doha to Potsdam to Geneva to Hong Kong and elsewhere presents an alarming spectacle of betrayal of European agriculture and consumers.  It concerns internationally traded services, research and development opportunities, patents and so on, which are important for the future.  We must, however, keep our eye on the main opportunity, the preservation of Irish agriculture and the Common Agricultural Policy.  I do not know where the dynamics are leading.  There is a US presidential election coming up, while the current Commission will leave office relatively soon and the term of the Director General, Mr. Lamy, is up.  The people in question may be rushing to have this under their belts for inclusion in their CVs.  I, therefore, urge the Minister to be extremely vigilant and not party to selling out European and Irish interests.According to the Commission's statement in Agenda 2000:The European Model is not the same model as pursued by our major competitors elsewhere.  There are many differences between ours and theirs.  Seeking to be competitive should not be confused with blindly following the dictates of a market that is far from perfect.  The European model is designed to safeguard the earnings of farmers, above all keeping them stable, using the machinery of the market organisations and compensatory payments.The fundamental difference between the European model and that of our major competitors lies in the multifunctional nature of Europe's agriculture and the part it plays in the economy and the environment, in society and in preserving the landscape.This involves consumers and environmentalists, as well as farmers.  It is all-embracing.  This needs to be set at the heart of the defence mechanisms used to protect our interests in the negotiations.We also need to know where we came from.  The raison d’être for the Common Agricultural Policy was that people in Europe were hungry in the 1950s after the Second World War.  If the buzzword today is “quality”, then it was “quantity”.  The policy ran aground in the 1980s because boats laden with butter floated off Cork harbour, there were beef mountains and milk lakes.  European taxpayers, rightly, reacted against such a development.  In the new millennium consumer interests have moved centre stage with the erosion of food surpluses and concern for animal welfare.  In the policy consumers and primary producers are now at one.  That model is worth preserving.We must also factor food security into the equation.  We are at record low levels of global food inventories from grain to dairy products, which must inform our policy in this regard.  The world's population doubled between 1900 and 2000 and is set to increase significantly by 2050, with an annual growth rate of 80 million.  This presents a serious challenge to global food security.There were significant market opportunities in the dairy sector last year because of drought in Australia.  This took out one of the major dairy producers in the world and a significant exporting nation.  There is increasing frequency of extreme climatic conditions, which affects food production.  Water use per capita has multiplied six times since 1900.  Challenges include desertification — the Sahara is moving north and south, taking arable land out of production.  There is increased urbanisation, particularly in developing countries.  China is building six cities the size of Dublin almost every couple of months.  There is also increasing consumption, particularly in emerging economies where there is a tendency to move towards western type diets high in protein.  Because of the very significant populations there, small percentage increases are leading to substantial increases in demand for food.There is almost a denial of that reality in the context of those charged by the interests of the Commission — Mr. Mandelson and his team — to negotiate on our behalf.  It is interesting that in the course of her speech I do not think the Minister mentioned Mr. Mandelson once by name.  It is important to remember where he comes from.  He was never a friend of the Common Agricultural Policy, nor was Mr. Blair, but they were very interested in cheap food.  His policy could effectively move towards a no-food policy in Europe and a significant escalation of outsourcing.  That is a very significant threat.  It dovetails with the issues of food miles, carbon footprint and climate change.  I do not know if there is a willingness at European level to put those issues centre stage in terms of the ongoing negotiations.I would prefer to make haste slowly and if there is not going to be an agreement I will not lose sleep about it in the short term.  An agreement will be good for us, but it has to be the right one.  It has to be borne in mind that whereas Mr. Mandelson might well turn off the tap of European production, it will not be that easy to restart the engine and turn it on again.  Once farmers leave the land it will be very difficult to get production turned on again in the quantities which may be needed in the event of global or regional disasters in food production.  It is not just a primary producer's interest.  It is a matter of concern, too, for consumers and the environment.  I do not believe, in the context of the Doha Development Agenda, that it can be left exclusively to Mr. Mandelson.I come to the issue of how the case is being prosecuted by the Government at EU level.  The Minister mentioned in her contribution that there was originally a group of 14 and that now 20 member states are opposed to these developments.  That has to reflect a growing frustration at the fact Mr. Mandelson is acting significantly beyond his negotiating brief from the Commission.  I want to avoid confrontation with the Minister because our interests in this regard are the same, but simply put, that is a failure at a political level to rein in the Commissioner and to tell him, in effect: "This far and no further shalt thou go".  In the interests of improved market access — non-agricultural market access, NAMA, is the jargon used — he should not be allowed to sell out the interests of European agriculture, and at a local level, Irish beef producers in particular, to get a deal.  It is the responsibility of the Taoiseach and the Minister to rein in Mr. Mandelson.  If 20 member states are so concerned about the Commissioner's activity, then I urge them to act.   If necessary let us have a special Intergovernmental Conference where Mr. Mandelson is reined in and a telling message delivered to the Commission.The danger is that the concessions which the EU made at the start of the 2001 Doha Development Agenda, subsequently CAP reform in 2003, the decoupling arrangements, single farm payments and REPS in particular — issues in the so-called green box — are now considered by Mr. Mandelson to be fair game.  The message from Ireland and many other countries that have decoupled should clearly be, "Hands off the green box".  These items are not up for discussion.  They are not trade distorting in the context of the WTO and the Commissioner must be given that message.  Mr. Mandelson also has an opportunity and an obligation to protect and preserve high standards of food production in the European Union.  It is galling in the extreme that one can now buy within the European Union that which cannot be produced there.I come to the issue that has been debated here regularly, Brazilian beef, which is available again here.  If Brazilians want access to European markets then, in the context of the WTO, let us have non-trade issues that will ensure their products are produced to a standard European consumers expect and not give them an unfair competitive advantage in putting their products into European supermarkets.  That, in essence, is the kernel of the issue.If we take the chicken and egg situation, we abandoned intensive production of poultry and sold our crates to Thailand and China.  Now, by virtue of arrangements facilitated under world trade, over which the European Union has no redress, we have chickens produced to standards we have no control over lying side by side with and competing in supermarkets with Irish and European poultry produced to the highest standards.  That is a betrayal of consumer interests as well and needs to be addressed.  We face the phasing out of battery egg production here by 2012.  The danger is that this business will just migrate eastwards and the eggs will come in from eastern Europe and elsewhere.  These are the animal welfare non-trade issues that need to be put centre stage by Mr. Mandelson, alongside food security in order to ensure there is a level playing pitch.  I should have thought that was what world trade arrangements were about, by and large — to ensure fair competition.  We will compete with anybody, the best in the world in terms of beef or any other sector, if we are given a level playing pitch.I had a number of other points to elaborate on, particularly in respect of the beef sector, but I am running out of time.  Mr. Mandelson needs to be reined in.  I read on the website that EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy was meeting this week the Swiss, Norwegian and Kazakhstan delegations.  If necessary, the Taoiseach and the Minister need to go to Mr. Barroso as President of the Commission and reissue Mr. Mandelson with his riding instructions in terms of negotiation.  Also, at this late stage, they need to talk directly to Mr. Lamy about European concerns.  These are Irish concerns too in the broadest context of the world trade talks.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12874	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely debate, recognising that Deputy Crawford sought its instigation.  In terms of the Minister's contribution, I am reassured.  It is the first time in my experience that we have had such a comprehensive outline of the Irish position vis-à-vis the negotiations, and I am reassured by the fact that there is a very strong Irish position, one that seeks to protect the national interest.  The very term “national interest” appears to have come into fashion again, because there are clear trends in how Ireland’s terms of trade have been affected, or potentially may be, by any deal negotiated by Mr. Mandelson, purportedly on our behalf.  This could, however, be detrimental ultimately to Irish agriculture and Ireland’s interests.  I am heartened that the Minister and her officials are sceptical and have expressed caution about the concessionary approach of the Commission in its approach to the negotiations. It would appear that Mr. Mandelson's negotiating position has been further weakened by criticism by French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the effect that the European Union was making too many concessions on agriculture.  It would appear, too, from the Minister's statement that the Irish and French positions are as one in this regard.  It begs the question as to how many other member states hold a similar position and whether Commissioner Mandelson's mandate has been overstepped.  As Deputy Creed stated, it is a question of determining whether the Commissioner's mandate should be reviewed on the basis that the potential for Irish agriculture is being undermined seriously by his current negotiating stance.The response of the EU Commissioner for External Trade to the remarks of President Sarkozy is that his hands are tied by those in emerging nations who want concessions on industrial goods or non-agricultural market access.  If President Sarkozy is sceptical or critical, it does not bode well for the next ministerial round, especially given his comments that he would oppose any WTO deal that went against the interests of France and the 27-nation European Union, especially in respect of agriculture.  Agriculture, therefore, remains a stumbling block to a deal.  Ironically, it is perhaps fortuitous that the French position is strong because I hope it will favour Ireland in the final outcome.It would appear that talks are not moving quickly enough for the United States, whose representatives are warning against what Ambassador Schwab, the US Trade Representative, is calling an "erosion" of willingness by some nations to open their markets to more imported farm goods.  The agricultural issues seem to have reached an impasse.  My understanding of this development is that future success will be based on the so-called Doha round of world trade talks, allowing for greater market access for agriculture in particular.  The big question will be whether there can be enough progress to allow a ministerial meeting in late March, April or even later to agree on the outline of a deal, given that the Doha round was launched in 2001 and was expected to last approximately four years.It is clear from the US perspective that there is a clear mood in favour of the liberalisation of agriculture.  The US trade representative, has stated an agreement on freer agricultural trade is essential if there is to be a Doha pact.  The US position is predicated on a liberalisation agenda including the European Union, by way of Mr. Mandelson advocating a similar line.  This involves the European Union reducing its subsidies in exchange for expanded access to markets in third countries and developing countries in particular.  To be frank, the Mandelson agenda is detrimental to both Irish agriculture and agriculture in developing countries.According to the Institute for International Integration Studies at Trinity College, "The European Union supports a more market-oriented multilateral trading system but is also concerned about social, economic and environmental sustainability".  It seeks recognition for non-trade concerns.  I remain sceptical about the EU position on non-trade concerns.  There is nothing in the current deliberations that would give solace to any Irish farmers competing in the dairy and beef sectors who fear the flooding of the Irish and EU markets with imports that are not subject to the same standards that apply within the EU Internal Market.The EU position, as adopted by Commissioner Mandelson, is nebulous.  The IFA, in its paper, Meeting the Challenges of WTO and Cap Reform, rightly reflects the concerns of consumers regarding "the double standards between those which Irish and other European farmers have to meet on food safety, [and] traceability... and the much lower standards applying to food imports into the EU".  It must be stated this is a rational concern predicated on a genuine fear that our standards of production will be traded away to meet an agenda that does nothing to protect our interests and concessions, which have been hard won through CAP negotiations for years.It must also be stated that the United States is championing the liberalisation of agricultural trade, targeting in particular the elimination of export subsidies and substantial improvements in market access.  One analysis of the US position is that it is weakened by the large increase in domestic support the US is paying to its farmers "and by doubts over whether the political support exists in Congress to face down its own farm lobby and embrace far-reaching reforms".The Doha agenda is unpopular and there are question marks over whether the end of the Bush regime in the United States will signal any mood for a deal in advance of a new President being appointed.  The Irish farming position is characterised by genuine fears about cuts to beef and dairy tariffs.  It is a question of whether there is enough support evident at Council of Ministers level for such a cut and of the consequences for the Irish position.  This has been outlined clearly today.  The Irish and French positions are very clear but one must ask whether there is a sufficient blocking majority to alter the EU Commission's position on the protection of agriculture in Ireland and other countries.Arguably, Ireland is a small peripheral nation in the negotiations and it relies on the trading bloc represented by the European Commission.  However, if the French position is similar to our own — I realise there will be subtle differences — we need to form an alliance.  The question remains as to whether the trading bloc in the European Union is sufficiently large to force Commissioner Mandelson's hand on the matter.  I remain sceptical because he has already received his mandate, but I hope it can be reversed in some respects.While guaranteeing food security for EU citizens is a priority and while this can best be achieved through a combination of supporting EU food production and through importation set in the framework of the WTO rules, food security also depends on the European Union's contribution to the building up of world stocks, which are dramatically low, and allowing the European Union not only to protect itself against shortages, but also to take responsibility with regard to global food security.  Such importation, however, must be subject to the same standards that Irish farmers adhere to, and there can be no trade-off or concessions on this matter.  In any quest to impose liberalisation of the regime, equality in terms of trade and standards must apply.  In that context, we must take cognisance of the need to protect the farmers of Europe, including Irish farmers, against a liberalisation agenda that will ultimately compromise the Irish comparative advantage in the beef and dairy sector and will add nothing of value to developing countries' terms of trade.Perhaps my assessment of the current WTO deliberations is open to debate, but it seems to me that the Irish farming position is not too dissimilar to that of developing countries in its opposition to the current round, albeit for entirely different reasons.  Ultimately, we must protect Irish agriculture and allow for an opening up of markets for third countries.  However, if there is to be any doubt about the future and competitiveness of Irish agriculture, and if the proposed tariff cuts are made, notwithstanding Commissioner Mandelson's association with a sister party of mine — I disown his current policies in this regard — there should be no deal and no compromise on this issue.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	251	The importance of agriculture to the economy is illustrated by the fact that 10% of our trade is in agricultural produce.  The greater proportion of that is within the European Union.The potential danger to Irish trade presented by the approach that Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson is adopting in the WTO negotiations is illustrated by the fact that at present over 60% of our exports and 60% of our imports are within the EU, with approximately 20% of exports going to the United States and over 10% of our imports originating there.  Therefore, a comparatively small proportion of our trade is with the developing world.That could change dramatically if the more radical proposals before the WTO come into effect with a potentially massive influx of food produce, particularly beef, from outside the EU, the greater part of that from Latin America.  That would undermine the entire agricultural sector in the EU and would quite possibly destroy our beef producing sector.  There is also the danger presented by further concessions on the importation of lamb from New Zealand.Curiously, while Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson is now an advocate of concessions by the EU on agriculture he was singing a different tune two years ago at the negotiations in Hong Kong.  At that time, despite the changes made to CAP in 2003 and despite the offer of further concessions, Mandelson stated:The problem is that whatever we offer is not enough for the highly competitive, very aggressive agricultural producers and exporters like Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.At the time he clearly recognised that those states were intent on forcing open the EU to their products at a potentially devastating cost to European farmers.He went on to claim that whatever the spin being put out by those countries on fair trade, the reality was that a victory for them would damage the interests of the most developing nations to the extent that agricultural trade between African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the EU might be wiped out.Indeed, it has been recognised by many economists that the liberalisation of agricultural trade does not bring benefits to developing countries, and least of all to farmers in those countries.  It has also been argued that protection of agriculture in the EU is not a significant factor in the problems of the developing countries.While some argue that opening EU to Latin American meat would be an act of trade justice, in reality the only beneficiaries would be the multinational corporations that control the trade and the large ranchers who produce the meat and who do not have to comply with EU standards of animal health and safety, nor indeed with EU standards of worker protection or regard for the natural environment.Unlike 2005, it would appear that Commissioner Mandelson is now willing to make those concessions if it will secure an overall deal.  This begs the question as to who he represents, given that France and other member states have been strongly critical of his stance on agriculture.  If the proposed concessions are deemed harmful to Irish agriculture, as is the general consensus, then the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and her Government colleagues need to make this argument strongly and in alliance with other European Union states whose interests are similarly under threat.  While such may be what is happening in the corridors of Brussels, they should not be behind the door about coming out publicly in the same way as the French Government has so clearly done.As we face into the referendum on the Lisbon treaty this issue is a timely reminder of how much control over our own affairs we have surrendered to the European Union and to a Commission that at times appears to act as though it was the sovereign power and not the supposed representative of member states, or that puts the interests of the major industrial nations and of the major corporations ahead of European farmers and of those states more dependent on farming.Indeed, it is interesting to note that last week the IFA, which has been consistently and enthusiastically in favour of previous proposals on European Union enlargement and centralisation, hinted that farmers and their families could not be expected to support the Lisbon treaty referendum if their livelihood was being undermined by the EU Commission in the WTO negotiations.It is clear that Irish farmers are beginning to realise that any guarantees made during the last reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on income security and the commitment of the EU to preserving family farming are contingent on bigger issues such as the WTO which threaten to totally undermine them.  During the 2003 reform of CAP farmers were assured by then Commissioner Fischler and by the Commission overall that agreeing to decoupling would satisfy the demand being made through the WTO to reduce the level of direct subsidies tied to production, and that by so doing farmers would enjoy considerably more freedom on what to produce and with some income security provided by the single farm payment.  Farmers therefore accepted the reform in good faith.  Only now do they discover that what was accepted in 2003 is not only under renewed assault, but the EU Commission itself appears to be party to that assault by its stance on the forthcoming negotiations.  Farmers therefore have the right to feel aggrieved and to expect that the EU will also act in good faith to defend the reformed CAP.There are other issues on the WTO, perhaps most notably the matter of genetically modified food products.  There has been massive pressure on the European Union from the United States Government, acting in the interests of the giant corporations, to license genetically modified products within the EU.  That has encountered considerable resistance and I understand all polls of popular opinion within the EU to date have indicated rejection of GM food products, and yet the Commission has persistently attempted to foist these products on farmers and consumers even though there is no evidence that they bring any benefits and, indeed, much more seriously, there remains considerable doubt over their safety.I noted that the Greens have affected some change in Government policy on this issue and Irish officials no longer consistently vote in favour of every pro-GM proposal.  It is still a long way from consistent opposition, as is the stated policy of both Sinn Féin and, indeed, the Green Party.It is to be hoped that the Government maintains a close eye on any proposals regarding genetically modified food products that may arise at the World Trade Organisation negotiations and that they oppose any further efforts to liberalise the availability of such products within the EU.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I, together with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness, have been working closely during the current Doha Development Agenda World Trade Organisation negotiations.  The very fact that this WTO round of negotiations is called the Doha Development Agenda underlines the rich world's acceptance that addressing the concerns of its developing partners was a precondition for getting the negotiations started.  The same perspective is needed if they are to be brought to a successful conclusion.The World Trade Organisation is the major intergovernmental regulator of international trade.  While its rules may have been more influenced by developed economies, the weight of the developing world is increasing.  Developing countries are now the majority at the WTO and exercise in their own right and when working together a significant negotiating block.  This was reflected at Doha when it was accepted that the overall success of the negotiations depended on a satisfactory outcome to their development component.A key outcome of the Doha meeting was a political declaration on the relationship between the trade related intellectual property agreement and public health in developing countries.  Acknowledging the serious public health crisis afflicting many developing countries, in particular, HIV-AIDS, Ministers agreed that public health concerns should override the issue of patent laws.  They also agreed that the rules governing the import by developing countries of patented drugs should be relaxed sufficiently to allow them access to cheap medicines to fight diseases such as HIV-AIDS and malaria.Ireland has an important role to play in the WTO negotiations at EU and global levels in ensuring a just and equitable outcome.   Such an outcome is sought for all countries and, in particular, the least developed countries.  Often these poorer countries lack the resources to fully articulate and advance their national interests in this process.  It would make no sense if Ireland, while being generous in its contributions to development co-operation and placing a sharp focus on poverty reduction, failed to follow this strategy to its logical conclusion.  This means striving to ensure global trade is an equally effective tool in the fight against poverty in developing countries.Developing countries have the potential to earn from trade many times what they obtain in official development assistance.  Consequently, I strongly believe they must be supported towards their fullest participation on an equal and fair basis in the global market if the millennium development goal of combating poverty is to be achieved by its target date.  Ireland, with its EU partners, has implemented a number of specific measures to further develop trade with developing countries.  The Cotonou partnership agreement provides for economic partnership agreements between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, states.EPAs, the subject of ongoing negotiations, are a new type of multilateral agreement intended to combine trade and wider development issues in a unified framework promoting regional integration.  I have consistently stated the development aspects of these agreements must take priority.Under the Everything But Arms initiative agreed by the European Union in February 2001, the least developed countries, within and outside the ACP group, have gained duty and quota free admission to the EU market for all but two products.  Access is being achieved on a phased basis by 2009 for rice and sugar.  This initiative was a particularly significant breakthrough for the least developed countries, as it offered free market access in areas such as agricultural and textile products in which they are most likely to be competitive.  These demand side initiatives are very important.   However, we also have to look at the supply side.  Improved market access is needed in order that the share of developing countries in international trade can grow.  Developing countries need assistance to build facilities and systems for producing, delivering and selling goods and services.  They need aid for trade, namely, aid focused specifically on trade capacity building.  This need has been increasingly recognised at international level in recent years.At the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in 2005 the WTO launched an aid for trade initiative and EU member states pledged to increase their collective aid for trade spending to €2 billion a year by 2010.  Ireland is playing its part in these WTO and EU aid for trade initiatives.  Our aid for trade support to international and local trade initiatives increased from €6.4 million in 2006 to more than €11 million in 2007.  Our multilateral budget supporting the major, mainly Geneva-based, international organisations involved in trade related technical assistance has also grown.  We will spend €9 million in 2008 as compared with €6 million in 2007.Last year more than €1 million was paid directly to the WTO programmes which provide technical assistance to build trade capacity in developing countries, including the WTO mission internship programme which has a positive impact in directly reinforcing developing country trade delegations at the WTO, and the WTO standards and trade development facility which assists developing countries to enhance their expertise and capacity to analyse and implement international sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards.  This improves their human, animal and plant health and thus, their ability to gain and maintain market access.Last year Irish Aid allocated €3.8 million to programmes in which the WTO is a partner, including the integrated framework.  This groups the six major international agencies involved in the provision of technical assistance for developing countries for trade related purposes.  The agencies are the International Monetary Fund, the International Trade Centre, the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, the WTO and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.  The integrated framework seeks to integrate trade with the poverty reduction strategies of least developed countries.  It achieves this through the co-ordinated delivery of trade related technical assistance in response to needs identified by the least developed countries.  Ireland has worked closely with fellow donors to fill identified gaps in the area of trade related capacity building.  We were among the founder members of the advisory centre on WTO law which provides legal training, support and advice on WTO law and dispute settlement procedures for developing countries.  We also joined the initial agreement establishing the agency for international trade information and co-operation.  The agency provides valuable practical assistance for developing countries by providing information and advice on developments in the WTO.  In a very practical way, it also provides temporary office space for least developed countries without representation in Geneva and gives them training in negotiation skills.  This is very important.As I mentioned, we are planning to increase our multilateral spend to €9 million this year.  The money will go to mainly Geneva-based organisations delivering trade related technical assistance.  As outlined by the Taoiseach at the EU-Africa summit last December, Ireland is committed to a considerable scaling up of our aid for trade related assistance targets for the African continent.  We are also keen to share knowledge and experience of private sector development.  In that regard, Irish Aid supports a not-for-profit organisation, TRAIDLINKS, which is connecting the African producer and the Irish supplier to ensure African products can enter the Irish market.Returning to the WTO negotiations, there are a number of issues of particular concern to developing countries and those working towards a more just and equitable global trade system.  Delivering on the development dimension of the Doha Development Agenda, DDA, will require enhanced market access for developing countries across the core areas of the negotiations in agriculture, non-agricultural market access and services.  There is potential, within the context of the agriculture negotiations, for a successful outcome to support cotton producing developing countries, particularly least developed countries and net exporters.  Special and differential, S and D, treatment provisions which can be included in WTO agreements to take into account the interests of least developed countries, in addition to those of developing countries, are also crucial to the success of the round from a development perspective.  Developing countries are seeking more precise, effective and binding S and D provisions.  Other important development aspects of the negotiations include making rules of origin more development friendly, which we support.  We also want to improve the dispute settlement understanding to make it easier for developing countries to use.Trade facilitation involves improving procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders to reduce costs and burdens.  In the trade facilitation negotiations the enhancement of technical assistance and capacity building for developing countries was listed as a specific goal of the negotiations exercise.  Last year the WTO launched a trade facilitation national needs assessment trust fund, to which Ireland has contributed €150,000.Developing countries have also made proposals to address their concerns regarding implementation issues arising from the Uruguay Round agreements.  An example is proposals intended to give longer transitional periods to developing countries to implement their obligations, which we support.  Ireland has also sought to give a strong pro-poor perspective to the Doha Development Agenda.  This will continue as the negotiations intensify in Geneva in the coming weeks.  Ireland remains strongly committed to the development dimension of the Doha Round.

If Irish agriculture is to survive, we must preserve the CAP.  There should be a balanced agreement between the various elements of the overall negotiations.  Agriculture should not carry a disproportionate burden in finalising a new agreement.  It is not acceptable that concessions in agriculture should be the price for achieving progress elsewhere.There should be a balance between the elements of domestic support, export subsidies and market access in the agriculture negotiations.  The emphasis should not be on any one aspect, in particular on market access.  In respect of domestic support, it is of vital importance to ensure that decoupled direct payments continue to qualify as the WTO green box classification and so remain exempt from reductions under the new round.  The Irish position must be adamant on that matter as far as our farmers are concerned.As regards market access, our aim should be to retain a realistic and effective level of protection for producers and exporters.  This should be done by ensuring that the two third deviation from normal tariff cuts will apply, minimising tariff expansion by use of partial designation at eight-digit level and by forcing changes in the calculation method for TRQ expansion, rejecting the latest Falconer proposals on quota under-fill, SSG and tariff simplification.Other issues of vital importance include the issue of food security.  Food security is not at the forefront of the agreement and does not appear to be a priority for Commissioner Mandelson.  With the increase in world population, global climate changes and the prevalence of bio-fuels as an alternative land use, the WTO agreement is vital in securing food supplies into the future.  We do not have to go that far back to remember that for many years after World War II, Great Britain had to continue food rationing and that without vital food supplies from Ireland at that time, might have had to continue it for many more years.Our Irish negotiators must ensure that non-trade issues such as animal welfare are not prioritised.  We have already seen potential problems arise in this area in respect of Brazilian beef.  We need to ensure that these issues are considered seriously in the context of ongoing talks.  The EU, and Ireland in particular, have a proud element of traceability as far as our food products are concerned.   If there is going to be a free-for-all trade after this forthcoming WTO agreement, that element of sustainability must be taken into consideration.  We should be committed to securing the best possible outcome for the agricultural sector in the EU.  It is of vital importance that we take a stronger position nationally on this issue by sending a delegation to meet with the director-general of the WTO, Pascal Lamy.  I understand that he is meeting with delegations from a number of EU states this week.I emphasise that it is very important that relevant Cabinet Ministers and our Taoiseach row in behind the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and wield as many instruments as possible to steer this issue in the right direction for Ireland and our Irish farming interests.  We do not contribute to the citrus fruit mountain and the wine lake in Europe.  Agriculture is our main industry.  When we entered the EU, we were told that we would become the bread basket of Europe.  The situation today is very far from this scenario.  If Commissioner Mandelson gets his way, agriculture is on a downward slope.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	255	The WTO talks offer made by Commissioner Mandelson represents the greatest threat to European and Irish agriculture since our accession to the EU.  The offer to reduce import tariffs in the EU by 70% would undermine milk and cereal production at a time when these two sectors are finally offering a decent return for producers following difficult years.However, livestock, particularly sheep and cattle, is the area most exposed by this offer.  Such a drop in tariffs would open the floodgates to produce from all over the world, with the current supply-demand balance and price being altered to such an extent that the viability of livestock production would be fatally compromised.The proposed tariff cuts would see sides of beef coming into the EU at €2.20 per kilogramme, well below the current EU market price of €2.90.  According to this morning's edition of The Irish Farmers Journal, the IFA’s highly respected chief economist, Mr. Con Lucey, has calculated that this could see beef imports rise to 2 million tonnes.  The impact on the current Irish price would be a reduction of €1.38 cent per kilogramme.  This is not sustainable.  Such an offer would not be made by a lonely widow to George Clooney on a leap year day.  It must be rejected.Import tariffs may be regarded as trade distorting by pure economic theorists but the reality is that they barely compensate European producers for the high production costs imposed by the extremely high environmental, welfare and traceability standards of European food production.  Nobody disagrees with these standards, which are to the benefit of consumers.  We can proudly stand over the quality of our meat and milk.  Consumers demand such high standards.  European farmers do not use growth-promoting hormones, do not use BST to increase milk production and do not use genetically modified crops.  They are required to invest in pollution control measures that are important for the environment but which are costly.  The costs of these measures are not borne by competing producers elsewhere in the world.Food security should be a high priority for Europe in these WTO talks.  For the first time in 50 years, Europe has a food deficit.  The rising worldwide demand for food has seen surpluses disappear and stocks fall dangerously low.  I met with the ambassador of India a few weeks ago.  He told me that every two months, the population of India increases by an amount equal to the population of Ireland.  Every two months, India's population increases by 4.5 million people.  The worldwide population increase is staggering.Climate change, environmental damage and changing disease patterns mean that European producers and consumers are vulnerable to any unforeseen circumstances.  Within the past three years, we have seen the vibrant sugar beet industry wiped out at the stroke of a bureaucratic pen in Brussels.  Sugar on the supermarket shelf is no cheaper, Carlow and Mallow have lost their industrial hub and thousands of livelihoods have been diminished or lost.Great Britain has long been out of step with the EU consensus and approach to food production.  It has operated a cheap food policy since the glory days of the British empire.  This approach has wrecked its agricultural economy and contributed to a penny-pinching attitude that has seen the family farm all but wiped out.  BSE and foot and mouth disease are seen by many as the inevitable consequences of such an approach.Commissioner Mandelson should not be allowed to adopt this attitude on behalf of European agriculture.  Our Government should not hesitate to veto his offer on behalf of European food producers and consumers.  We are embarking on a debate on the role of Europe in the EU reform treaty.  Sometimes, being a good parent means being firm and saying "No, you cannot do that".  As good Europeans, we must tell the Commission that it cannot undermine European food production.  The only question that remains is whether we have the guts to do this or the political skills to build a blocking group within the Council of Ministers and Heads of State to reject this suicidal offer.  The reputations of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and this Government are on the line.  We cannot endorse the Mandelson position.

This is an important opportunity for all of us to respond, to lead and to come up with some creative ideas on trade, agriculture and the rapidly changing international scene.  It also provides an opportunity to see the pitfalls and the need for radical, new ideas with regard to agriculture.  We must think outside the box when it comes to our agricultural industry.  I want to see an economic re-think because many of us have observed the shift to the extreme right which is damaging countries and the international economic order.Change is needed.  I agree with Barack Obama who constantly refers to change.  He is correct in his view that we also need vision and hope for all people.  More than 2,000 years ago Confucius said there were two types of people who do not change, the foolish and the dead.  This applies to us all and in particular in the context of the World Trade Organisation and markets.I suggest that when considering trade and our economy we look at the facts and pay less attention to the spin from some politicians and so-called political commentators.  The level of employment growth is slowing down.  Job gains were still being recorded in the Irish economy during 2007.  The total number at work reached 2.139 million, an advance of 66,800 or 3.2% in the final quarter of 2007.  However, not all sectors shared in job gains.Employment levels fell in both construction and manufacturing last year.  The construction force amounted to 284,600 workers, 13.7% of total employment but this dropped to 279,000.  We must be active and creative when dealing with this issue.  I raised these issues in my agreement with the Taoiseach regarding the development of the economy in the event of a down turn.  It is important we look at these issues and target projects and investments in the building sector across the north side of Dublin.  It is important to target community services and I welcome the €6 million granted yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the clean up of Dublin bay.

The WTO is an organisation for liberalising trade, a forum for governments to negotiate trade agreements, a place for them to settle trade disputes, and it operates a system of trade rules.  The WTO is a forum where member governments attempt to solve trade problems with each other.  This is a very important aspect of the WTO.  It can use its clout when smaller countries come under pressure and can assist them by not hammering them economically.  I refer in particular to the United States and its blockade of Cuba which is an international disgrace.  A small country like Cuba is trying to change and develop but it is being hammered by its next door neighbour the USA.  I urge the Minister to raise these issues at international level.The WTO is the only international organisation dealing with the global rules of trade between nations.  Its main function is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.  The result is assurance.  Consumers and producers know that they can enjoy secure supplies and greater choice of finished products, components, raw materials and services.  Producers and exporters know that foreign markets will remain open to them.  The result is a more prosperous, peaceful and accountable economic world.Virtually all decisions in the WTO are taken by consensus among all member countries and are ratified by the members' parliaments.  Trade friction is channelled into the WTO's dispute settlement process where the focus is on interpreting agreements and commitments to ensure that countries' trade policies are in conformity with them.  The risk of disputes spilling over into political or military conflict is thus reduced.  It is important to reduce the potential for military conflict and we must remain vigilant on that issue.  This is the reason many of us are concerned about these issues because they are coming down the tracks and we need to be creative in our response.By lowering trade barriers the WTO system also breaks down the other barriers between peoples and nations.  The heart of the system is known as the multilateral trading system.  These are the WTO's agreements negotiated with and signed by a majority of the world's trading nations and ratified in their parliaments.  These agreements are the legal ground rules for international commerce.  They are contracts guaranteeing member countries important trade rights.  They also bind governments to keep their trade policies within limits which is to everyone's benefit.  The agreements were negotiated and signed by governments but their purpose is to help producers of goods and services and exporters to conduct their business in a positive way.The outcome of the current negotiations will determine the maximum levels of protection support which will apply to the agricultural sector in the future.  Given that the process of liberalisation will be significantly more advanced, the negotiations represent a real challenge to the future of Irish agriculture.  I agree with some of the comments made earlier.  I urge people to be sensitive and strong with regard to this issue.The original GATT applied to agricultural trade but it contained some loopholes.  It allowed countries to use subsidies and some non-tariff measures such as import quotas.  Agricultural trade became highly distorted with the use of export subsidies which would not normally have been allowed for industrial products.The Uruguay Round produced the first multilateral agreement dedicated to the sector.  It was a significant first step towards order, fair competition and a less distorted sector.  It was implemented over a six-year period and is still being implemented by developing countries under the ten-year period which began in 1995.  The Uruguay Round agreement included a commitment to continue the reform through negotiations.  These were launched in 2000 as required by the agricultural agreement.  This is to do with fairer markets for farmers and it is not just a rural issue.I represent an urban area but every Member of the Oireachtas has a responsibility to be supportive of farm families and the agricultural sector.  Every Member of the Oireachtas should be behind this industry because of its importance.  There is potential for further decline and we all have a responsibility.I share the Minister's concern that the Commission has been adopting an unnecessarily concessionary approach to the negotiations.  The Commission negotiates in the WTO on behalf of the member states on the basis of a mandate which is agreed in the Council of Ministers.  I urge the Minister to be vigilant on this issue.  The Minister is correct to be deeply concerned about the suggestion that the EU should provide further concessions on a range of agricultural issues, in particular, the level of tariff reductions, treatment of sensitive products and related tariff quota expansion.  I do not find this acceptable and I agree with the Minister's earlier comments.  She referred to the intensive discussions in Geneva on the text but many technical as well as political issues remain to be resolved.  There should be cross-party support on this issue and we should row in behind the Minister with regard to this issue.  As an Independent Deputy representing an urban area I will continue to push this issue and to be very supportive of agriculture.  These are crucial issues.We all have a duty to protect and develop our agricultural industry.  We have a duty to assist farm families and these issues should be top of the political agenda.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I thank the Government Whip for agreeing to allow time for this debate.  I sought this debate last Thursday because many things have happened regarding agriculture.  Discussions were taking place outside but this House had no relevance to them.  I am glad the Minister came here today and clearly laid out her stall.  As Deputy Creed said, we do not have any major disagreement with her; it is the delivery that is all-important.There is considerable anxiety among young farmers especially.  They are making major investments at present, which is great.  However, there is concern over what the future holds, particularly for the beef sector.  It would be better to have no agreement than to have a bad agreement.  The Common Agricultural Policy has been good for Ireland over the years.  It has been altered dramatically with the MacSharry and other changes in more recent times.  We now have direct payments rather than supports for the beef and dairy sectors.  Following those direct payments, farmers must compete in world markets.The main anxiety is that Commissioner Mandelson seems to have a free hand.  It is unacceptable that a man with his attitude towards agriculture is negotiating on our behalf without being reined in.  I am glad to have the opportunity not only to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on her stand, but also to call on the Taoiseach and every member of his Cabinet to back her.  Ultimately, it will be dealt with at Heads of Government level.  The Taoiseach with all his contacts in Europe needs to work to ensure that Commissioner Mandelson is reined in and told how important agriculture is not just to Ireland, but to the entire European Community.As other speakers have said, Europe used to have enormous surpluses, but not any longer.  With the prices being paid in some sectors, the change is dramatic.  The county I represent, Monaghan, accounted for 66% of all poultry production in the country.  The poultry sector has been through dramatic times.  Grove Turkeys is winding down its slaughtering capacity.  Some 85 farmers just do not know where to go.  Poultry farmers are seeing imports from Thailand, Brazil and elsewhere which have been produced under totally different conditions from those under which we must produce.  That is the free trade against which they must operate.  They are under strict veterinary control, but there is no veterinary control at European level.  For example, if the European Union wants to sell beef to any third country we must accept the vets and personnel from that country on the line on the day and not one animal can be slaughtered without that person being present.  However, we allow product into this country without any supervision other than spot inspections, advice of which is given in advance.  Farmers would love those sorts of inspections.  Irish farmers, especially the young ones, are concerned that the WTO talks will be handled by Commissioner Mandelson.While the issue of labelling is not relevant to the WTO in one sense, it is relevant to people knowing the origin of the product and that it is a quality product.  The Government needs to consider the matter very seriously.The dairy sector has gone through a reasonably good time in the recent past.  Again, the WTO will have serious implications for it.  As Deputy Johnny Brady and other members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food can verify, we saw US dairy farmers using steroids in milk producing cows.  While we do not want that, we want fair competition, which is why I insisted on having a debate on the WTO talks in this House.  One must wonder if the talks are being held back to allow the referendum on the Lisbon treaty to take place first.  The original IFA stance on the treaty was supportive.  However, suddenly when the issue of the WTO talks arose, it decided that if the talks were not successful it would oppose the treaty.  We need clarification from the IFA on the matter.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I wish to make a few fundamental points on the World Trade Organisation talks.  The issue has been rumbling through here and through Europe for many years and it has many aspects.  It is now reaching a crucial stage.  In June 2007, in order to kick-start the process of trying to get agreement again, four major trading blocs met with representatives from the European Union, the United States, Brazil and India.  They came together as the important partners in the process.  I fully support the stance of our agriculture spokesman, Deputy Creed, that everything that can be done to back the Government and the Minister from this side of the House will be done provided that she delivers.  In the company I mentioned, she is a very small player.  When this decision will be finally made, she will not even be a member of the audience — it will be that far removed from us.It is against that background that we have made our peace within the European Union at great sacrifice to every farmer not alone in Ireland, but right across Europe.  Once that "Green Box" was closed up to 2013 and several other aspects agreed, that was to be our negotiating level.  In other words, that was what the European Union claimed we would need to do to come into line with the requirements of the World Trade Organisation.  We did that at tremendous sacrifice to every farmer in Europe, not only in Ireland.  We then had the great misfortune to be represented by Commissioner Mandelson.  I regard the Commissioner as a fox in charge of the hen house.  I have no respect for him because he has a contrary view of what rural development is all about not only in Ireland, but throughout the European Union.Regardless of how we manage it, we need to start at Heads of Government level.  We would need to be like red flies, as they say — we should be all over the world at this stage.  We should speak to the Director General of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, to ensure he understands that our interests are the interests genuinely held across Europe and not the ones enunciated by Commissioner Mandelson if he decides to go on a solo run.  It has all the signs of it at every announcement that Commissioner Mandelson makes.  He is a product of the old British rule that believed food could not come cheap enough.  In other words, no matter how we get it and where it is produced and under what circumstances, it should be given to us cheap and we will take it.  We all know that in this country because of the rules we have for food, it is as near to organic production as can be found.  The problem in more recent years has been that farmers were losing money in production.I do not believe those talks will conclude this year because of the American presidential election.  However, when they do, I hope that Commissioner Mandelson's views will be sidelined.  Ultimately, we in this country should be given the opportunity to be paid for the product that is grown on every acre of Irish land.  The IFA did very well to stop the Brazilian imports.  We should ensure that unless imports are of the same standard as we produce in the European Union they may not come in and if they do it should be at a significant price.  I hope the Taoiseach will take this matter extremely seriously and that the Government jet will not stay on the ground this summer, but will fly all around Europe and America to ensure our views on this important issue are known.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I am delighted to contribute to this debate.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, well in the forthcoming world trade talks.  The negotiations will be in safe hands with both Ministers involved.I will concentrate on the beef sector, which is so important to rural Ireland, including my constituency.  If Peter Mandelson gets away with his plan, our beef industry will be dead and so will rural Ireland.  A competitive beef industry is central to a vibrant and sustainable agriculture sector.  It contributes significantly to the country's economic growth and particularly its trade balance.  It provides employment and is a key driver of investment especially in rural areas.  The Minister's recognition of the sector's importance was clearly demonstrated by her establishment of the beef forum, which brings together representatives of all major stakeholders.  Her attendance at the forum's first meeting yesterday was very important.Our industry is recognised as one of the unrivalled success stories within the Irish agri-food sector.  We produce over 500,000 tonnes of beef annually, with more than 90% of this exported.  In 2007, beef exports were valued at almost €1.6 billion, making Ireland the largest net beef exporter in Europe or, indeed, in the northern hemisphere.  This remarkable achievement is a testament to the efforts being made by all stakeholders in the industry: farmers, processors and sellers.Irish beef is recognised internationally as a watchword for quality and excellence.  This is a major contrast to the situation just a few short years ago when, with the loss of third country markets, the sector faced a significant threat.  However, the industry and its stakeholders refused to lie down.  Producers, processors and marketers combined their talents to promote actively Irish beef in new markets, identifying niche markets in particular.Our industry recognises that consumer tastes continue to evolve and it has responded accordingly.  The result is that over 90% of total beef exports go to the high-value internal EU marketplace.  Last year, our beef exports to continental Europe, at some 235,000 tonnes, recorded their sixth consecutive year of growth.  The retail and market spread which Irish beef now boasts within Europe are unique.  Customers in these countries trust Irish beef and it is this trust that engenders product loyalty and a price premium in good times and bad.We are all well aware of the current situation concerning Brazilian beef imports.  I fully endorse the response of the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to vote against the European Commission's proposal for a partial ban in December 2007.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	268	It is not enough.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The Minister took that step because she was not happy with the Commission's proposal for a partial ban on the basis of information available at the time.  What is happening now?  As part of the arrangements under the partial ban, a number of Brazilian farms have been approved for export to the EU whereas the requirement should be that any such farms should first be approved by the food and veterinary office as meeting EU standards.  This was the stance taken by the Minister when she voted against the Commission's proposal and this is what should now be happening.The beef sector continues to face challenges.  The evolving marketplace requires that all involved should be in a position to respond and meet these tests head on.  Irish beef faces increased competitive pressures from South America in all of its key markets.  The low-cost base and abundance of supply in Brazil and Argentina, in particular, continue to challenge Irish exporters.The ongoing WTO negotiations are also crucial from Ireland's perspective, particularly with regard to beef, and it is vital for any agreement to recognise this.  The Minister has acknowledged this in the past and I urge her to maintain this strong stance in the Council for as long as these WTO negotiations continue.The price of feed materials worldwide has increased significantly over the last year and this is putting serious pressure on producers.  This comes on top of ever-increasing costs in such areas as compliance with legislation on environmental protection and animal welfare, labour and various other overheads.  These factors have impacted on the returns available to producers.

As practically the most globalised country in the world and also one with a strong agricultural interest, we are interested in a genuinely balanced outcome.  By and large, so far, in previous GATT and WTO rounds that has been done in a reasonably satisfactory way.The development dimension is also important but it should be stressed that the poorest APC countries have benefited very much from access to the CAP and to European markets.  The issues are not really with those countries but with what one might call some of the much more advanced third countries.As regards future beef imports, it is extremely important to have a level playing field so the same standards apply.  Ireland is not as small a player as has been made out.  We are at the core of an important alliance, including France and Poland.  Other countries have also come in, as the Minister explained.  There is deep distrust of the negotiations.  Concessions have been made up front and when that happens there is always a danger that more will be demanded.We do not have a very reassuring track record concerning Commissioner Mandelson in this country.  I certainly remember the negotiations on police reform when we were assured that the Patten report was being implemented, when in fact much of it was being gutted.  The work had to be redone after Mr. Mandelson had left.  It is not too often that a Minister has to resign twice over issues of trust.

The question, however, is where the negotiations will be at that time.  This issue was discussed recently at a meeting between members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  I was stimulated by the discussion to make the point, which is a missing element in the argument, that it is all very well for us to lament the effects on our beef industry but we must also appeal to other people's interests.  For centuries — before independence and partition, but also since then — we have been one of the principal suppliers to the British market.  They have a high population of nearly 60 million and are unable to feed themselves.  They should not think that an outcome that seriously damages the Irish agriculture industry will not have a direct impact on the security of food supply in Britain.  Their interests are at stake in this, not just ours.  There is a total underestimation across the water of the importance of the agriculture dimension of these negotiations.  In a situation of climate change and where there are various security threats, a plentiful supply of food in close proximity is very important.  In their dislike of the Common Agricultural Policy, the British are completely blind to where their own interests lie.  We need to make that argument as well as underlining how much food they import from Ireland.  In difficult situations in future they would be very glad to have that supply.  If it is no longer there, however, the population of Great Britain will be in considerable difficulty.

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Having listened to the debate so far, it is interesting that for the first time since I came to the House, we are all talking from the one hymn sheet.  It is a question of how we deliver a result for the Irish people and the citizens of Europe generally.  Deputy Mansergh referred to the stimulating discussion that took place with our Northern Ireland counterparts this week.  The points he raised were well made.  Some 50 or 60 years ago, however, in the aftermath of the Second World War, the EU was founded on the basis of ensuring peace and security for the nations of Europe.  One aspect of this was to ensure an adequate food supply.  The Union now incorporates some 500 million people and we are no longer self-sufficient in food.The Commissioner for Trade, Mr. Peter Mandelson, is operating on a mandate arising out of research that is seven years old, when food security and production was based on a different model to that which pertains today.  CAP reform, various environmental schemes and an increased population have all contributed to lower agricultural production in the EU.  The Commissioner's current proposals would take €40 billion out of the agri-food sector and render certain agricultural activities unviable.  In such an eventuality, we could become entirely dependent on imported foods.As I said last week, there is a danger that we will be 500 million people at the end of a gas line from Russia and a food line from God knows where.  I am not sure where our food will come from.  The Argentinian authorities, for example, are talking about limiting the amount of beef for export.  They have already limited the quantity of grain exported with the objective of ensuring stability of food supply for their own population.  The Indo-China area is increasing in affluence and its enhanced purchasing power will mean that much of the food that traditionally came to Europe from Australia and New Zealand will only travel as far as Indo-China where there will be people to buy it.  Yet we are talking about further reducing food production.We must all agree that the Government be charged with the responsibility of securing enough support from other Ministers and Governments to ensure Mr. Mandelson is brought to heel.  One calls to mind the old saying that when one is in a hole one should stop digging.  The Commissioner does not seem able to stop digging, however, and he has dug himself into a position from which it is impossible to extract himself.  We have seen in negotiations in trouble spots worldwide that it is sometimes necessary for certain people to stand back and be replaced before progress can be made.  I am strongly of the view that the same is true in this case, although it will be difficult to achieve.We all agree that farming and the agri-food sector is in serious jeopardy.  The message that must go out to the citizens of Europe is that their food supply is in serious jeopardy.  In 1973, the average family grocery budget accounted for more than 35% of household income.  This figure has decreased to less than 10%.  People take food for granted and the amount that is wasted is vulgar.  Food is considered cheap and accessible and no cause for concern.  People must realise that it should not be taken for granted, just as we can no longer take petrol and other fuels for granted.  We must sell this message.  If we had a greater awareness in this regard, we would not be so free in relinquishing our agri-food industry and diminishing the security of our food supply.As spokesperson on food for Fine Gael, I am obliged to reiterate how important it is that we not lose sight of this.  We have developed an industry that is quality assured and traceable.  The world market price about which we speak so much is the lowest common denominator and indicative of a race to the bottom.  If food becomes scarce and we are not at least 80% to 90% self-sufficient, we will find ourselves at the mercy of the world market price.   We will know all about it when it increases.  Food is a basic necessity of life.  There has been much discussion about agri-food and the effect on farmers.  As a farmer, I understand that completely.  However, it is important that we alert the citizens of Europe to the dangers to their food supply.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the discussion on this motion, which was put forward by our agricultural spokespersons, Deputies Creed and Crawford.  Since joining the EU in 1973 — or, as it was known then, the EEC — Ireland has benefited exceptionally well from its membership.  Before that, our trade was dependent on our neighbour, the United Kingdom.  Since joining the Union, we have opened up to new markets and trade.  Irish food is some of the best produced in the EU.  Over the period of our membership, we have received more from the EU than we have paid in, in the region of €55 billion.  The EU has gone a long way to funding Irish life, particularly Irish farming.As other speakers observed, the recent developments in the WTO talks are extremely worrying.  The EU has given enough through the years.  I am concerned at the scale and pace of the proposed reductions in domestic supports, especially in terms of the impact on the access to EU markets for agriculture and beef.  We are all aware of the increase in imports from non-EU countries, particularly South America.  Only last year, pig producers protested in Dublin at the amount of international pork products being sold here under an Irish label.  We have given enough and must now protect what we have.The Commissioner for Trade, Mr. Mandelson, who lost two Cabinet jobs in the British Government, seems to take no notice of the views of other member states.  I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to take a stronger stance on this issue.  I make the same plea to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness, who is in the Chamber and who has represented Ireland at various meetings.  I read recently that the French President, Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, has indicated his intention to oppose firmly any agreement that would sacrifice French and EU agricultural interests.  The Taoiseach must take a stronger position on this issue.  There are 130,000 farmers in the State but many will be forced to leave agriculture.  Already the statistics show that only 15% of farmers are under 35 years of age.In the context of the forthcoming referendum campaign on the Lisbon treaty, it is an unhelpful message to send out that Europe is not defending our cause at the WTO talks.  This could influence the electorate and affect the outcome of the referendum.  I urge the Taoiseach and his Ministers to be more vocal and to co-operate with our European counterparts to oppose these measures.

Mr. Mandelson seems to be getting more mentions than either Mr. Sarkozy or Barack Obama, although I was glad to hear Deputy Finian McGrath declare his support for the latter.Many issues could be raised in this debate.  Deputies who listen to me speaking for one minute will know that I do not have a rural background.  It may come as a surprise to some Deputies to learn that Tallaght in Dublin South West has a rural community.  There is a small farming community and I take an interest in what it does.  It is important that I support it on an occasion such as this.I commend the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, on the work he is doing, which does not always get headlines.  I am glad Deputy Breen acknowledged it.  A debate such as this gives Deputies an opportunity to highlight the Departments which are doing wonderful work but which do not get front page headlines.  I am a supporter of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  With regard to remarks which have just been made, I am confident they will continue to fight Ireland's case.  As we approach the referendum on the reform treaty, I am interested to hear Deputy Breen say it will be held in June.  If he is correct, I congratulate him.

We had a very worthwhile meeting last night with guests from a number of African countries when issues relating to agriculture and food were raised.  Unfortunately, many colleagues were unable to attend.As I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt's remarks I considered the importance of the question of food in Ireland and Europe.  If we face challenges in this regard, the people of Africa certainly do.  It is important that we support them in this regard.  Agriculture is the most climate sensitive of all industries and must be made sufficiently robust to withstand the effects of global warming.  As I listened to Deputy McGrath I remembered a script sent to me by Senator Barack Obama of a speech he made on climate change.  He made the point that we did not take climate change seriously and assumed that food would continue to be plentiful for the rest of time.  In fact, we face a huge challenge.  I am glad people, including the next President of the United States, are taking an interest in these matters.  It is good that we, on a Thursday afternoon with a packed Visitors Gallery of students from schools throughout the region, take the opportunity to support what is being said and done in this regard.  This subject might not get headlines but it is an important one.I am no more interested in food than anyone else.  However, I had a health scare about nine years ago when I had a heart bypass operation.  At the time I thought about many things, including my attitude to food.  I have since tried to eat more fish, chicken and vegetables.  A debate such as this brings the importance of such issues home to us all.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I am pleased to have the opportunity to deal with some of the issues raised in the course of this debate and to address the issue of the world trade talks and their progress to date.  The debate has been constructive and worthwhile.  It shows that the House can have a function in the course of current events, deliberate on the issues which concern us and have an effective input into the work of Departments.  In that regard, this debate is very worthwhile.  It is good to hear Members from all parties express support for the efforts being made to ensure we get a fair and balanced deal in the WTO negotiations.I thank the officials involved in this work.  While the debate has now moved to the centre of the political stage, for years work has been undertaken by officials through the Article 133 committee and a number of others.  They continue to engage with officials throughout Europe to learn the up-to-date position and understand what is happening in the world trade talks.As Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am responsible for trade and commerce.  My background is business.  I come from a constituency where Glanbia-Avonmore is located, which has strong agricultural roots and is very much involved in business.  I see at first hand the need to have a balanced outcome to the talks.  I see the need for a positive outcome to the current round of World Trade Organisation talks to ensure rules and regulations and a framework for business are established.The other part of my brief takes me across the world to promote Irish companies and ensure they get a foothold in other economies where they can ensure their goods and services are sold at a competitive rate, that our services are developed, that the jobs created in Ireland are sustainable and that we can grow markets throughout Europe and the world.  Because of the WTO talks, regulations and the existence of a framework I have seen Irish companies access markets where it would otherwise have been extremely difficult to gain a foothold.  That underlines for me the need for a positive outcome to the talks.  In countries as diverse as Russia, Dubai, Abu Dabi or the United Arab Emirates Irish companies are establishing a foothold and being recognised and respected for the trade in which they are engaged.  The Irish diaspora have ensured Irish companies, when represented abroad, are supported.  They assist them to make contacts, establish business partnerships and conduct the trade which is necessary to ensure our exports are maintained at a sustainable level and will create and sustain jobs in Ireland.  That is why the WTO is so significant for us.In the last three weeks I have travelled all over Europe to meet the WTO, Mr. Pascal Lamy, Mr. Peter Mandelson and other trade Ministers.  I met the chairmen of each of the pillars of the WTO before the texts were written.  I impressed on them Ireland's concerns, not only with regard to agriculture but also with regard to non-agricultural market access, services, rules and trade facilitation.  I insisted that they take note of the Irish position in the context of Europe and its trade with the rest of the world.  Small countries have a say.I must correct Deputy Connaughton's remark that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is just one person in a very big pool.  In our discussions with the French Minister, Mr. Michel Barnier, I saw a strong relationship with senior Ministers from big countries within Europe, an understanding on their side of the Irish position and a willingness to engage with us in the protection, not only of Irish agriculture, but also of business generally in Ireland.  The position of Germany was the same when I met with the German trade secretary, Dr. Pfaffenbach.  The support for Ireland is there and it is not as if just one man — Peter Mandelson — is the issue.  I have heard much criticism of him in this House, although I found him a charming gentleman who was willing to listen but perhaps was not supportive of our position.Notwithstanding Mr. Mandelson's position, it should be up to us to impress on him what we need within the context of WTO for Ireland and its agriculture and business.  Most of the debate today centred on agriculture but we must look at the need for this country to have open market access in the developing countries and ensure our Irish companies are willing and able to trade in those markets without hindrance.  They should be able to get a foothold where they normally might not if these regulations and agreements were not in place.We should do this in the context of what is happening in India, China and other major countries so we can access them.  We must understand the pillar of these negotiations relative to rules and dumping, as that is a significant issue for the country.I have a difficulty with these talks in that we are expected to take on the agricultural text and the non-agricultural market access text, with all the other pillars falling into place, such as services, trade facilitation, rules and so on.  That is not the way I would do business.  My background is in business and when I sit down to deal with somebody in the marketplace, I like to see the colour of their money and what is on offer right across the spectrum of that deal.  We do not have that on this occasion, although we have the modalities within agriculture and the setting out of the text in terms of NAMA.  There is little or nothing in the NAMA text that would encourage me to do a blind deal on the other pillars.  We want to develop services within Europe, particularly within Ireland, against stiff competition and there is nothing in the services text supporting our case.  Rules are not even spoken about.Nobody speaks about the next aspect of the deal, trade facilitation, yet in terms of exports we need all that in place.  I am not prepared to subscribe to a deal concerning only agriculture, and dealing with it, as it does, in a negative way by cutting back where we stand on the Common Agricultural Policy.  Agriculture is made up of trade and commerce and we must look at what is happening in other countries in that respect.  We must understand our position in such a context.  I pay tribute to the IFA and members such as Michael Treacy, Michael Berkery and Padraig Walshe, as well as beef exporters in IBEC.  They have given a serious commitment to the World Trade Organisation and the current level of talks.  They have been at the coalface insisting that Ireland's position be recognised within Europe, that trade be protected and that agriculture and the 2005 Hong Kong mandate be acknowledged.In my opinion, Mr. Mandelson has gone way beyond the mandate given to him.  It is up to Ireland and other European countries, such as the strong presences of France and Germany, to insist on telling Mr. Mandelson he has gone beyond that mandate and that he return to the mandate he was given.  If that turns out to be the case, Ireland will protect what it has and do well within agriculture.  Once we do that, we must look at what is on offer across the other three pillars.  Currently, there is nothing on offer to convince me we should do a deal.Turning specifically to agriculture, I will speak on the Brazilian position.  Brazilian beef has been banned but how long will it take those big ranchers to get to the point where they again meet European Union standards?  I suggest it will not be very long, and that they are nearly at that mark now.  If, in the context of the agricultural text, they begin to export their product again, we will find 300,000 tonnes of Brazilian beef in the European market, which will undoubtedly have a relative effect on Ireland and the promotion of our beef.  It will damage the beef industry, something we cannot tolerate.  I have stated directly to Mr. Mandelson that we will not tolerate what is currently on offer.Another figure in the agricultural text indicates 2 million tonnes of butter is consumed in Europe each year.  At present, 75,000 tonnes comes in from New Zealand and, according to what is on offer, 175,000 tonnes will be introduced to the European market.  That is an industry we must protect.  There is nothing available to us.In the pigmeat sector a farmer can lose €12 to €20 per head.  Beet has gone from the Irish scene.  Most Irish agricultural activity is not just under threat, as people are going out of business and cannot sustain their position within the sector.  That was explained not just to Mr. Mandelson but to Mr. Lamy and the other trade ministers who have genuine concerns about the direction these talks are taking.Our Government position must be to continue to insist on our position within Europe and to have a strong European deal done for us.  I have stated publicly that no deal is better than the deal on the table currently.  Through my discussions with the trade ministers, the WTO and Mr. Mandelson, I have heard the word legacy used.  It is used in the context of a legacy for the American Presidency, a legacy for Mr. Lamy or a legacy for Mr. Mandelson.  In my opinion, that factor has no place whatever in the deal and should not even be considered.  A deal is about what is good economically for the countries which subscribe to the WTO.  That is where the concentration of energy should be and what the deal should be all about.  We should consider how the deal can best give access to all of the other world markets.There is pressure on food.  Taking the consumption of meat in China alone, the population continues to increase at an expanding pace and Chinese people will increase consumption from ten kilos of meat per person now to 55 kilos of meat as that economy grows.  That will put on significant pressure.  The example of such people drinking a pint of milk per day has been suggested, which will also have a major impact on world markets.  We need a framework within agriculture to deal with all of what is on offer.The role of the Minister or myself as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce, the Taoiseach and other senior Ministers has been mentioned by the Opposition.  Not a day goes by without senior Ministers and officials engaging on the current status of the world trade talks.  It is wrong to say they are being put off because we will be dealing with a referendum.French local elections will not finish until 16 March and there is no doubt Mr. Sarkozy is taking a particular interest in agriculture within France and the impact of these discussions on the outcome of those elections.  The position is similar with Germany and parallels can be drawn between the referendum here and elections in Spain, or presidential elections.  There is a considerable amount of work, leaving aside those public votes, to bring about what must be achieved in a final deal within the WTO.My suggestion is that we put our support behind the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as well as other Ministers involved in these discussions.  We must insist on putting our view across to the media and Europe in general that we are unanimous in believing the present deal is not balanced and could not be sold to the Irish electorate if required.  It is not a deal we can subscribe to, not just because of the agriculture element but because the other three pillars are not concluded.  We do not have the text and they do not appeal to the Irish business person or individuals or enterprises engaged in agriculture.  That is the message which must go out from here.  It is up to us to encourage our partners in Europe and those who support us to tell Peter Mandelson that this is our position.  We need a deal in Europe but it cannot be any kind of deal.  It must stand up and be implementable across the four pillars of the talks.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	283	As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in regard to the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  As the Deputy is aware, the implementation of individual national road projects, including the Dublin Port tunnel, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.The Dublin Port tunnel was closed on Wednesday, 27 February for approximately nine hours because of an electronic equipment failure.  This is the latest in a sequence of electronic equipment failures to cause a temporary closure of the tunnel.  The NRA and Dublin City Council have repeatedly taken up the issue of electronic equipment failure with the contractors.  Arising from last Wednesday's incident, I have urged both organisations to intensify their efforts to remedy the equipment failures and indeed any other causes for occasional tunnel closures.  To put this issue in perspective, it is useful to note that there have been four unplanned tunnel closures since 1 January 2008.  These closures have resulted in the loss of just over 2% of planned tunnel availability time.Responsibility for the design, installation and provision of the various tunnel systems was that of Nishimatsu-Mowlem-Irishenco, NMI, under the terms of its contract to Dublin City Council.  During the delivery of the project, both the NRA and Dublin City Council were repeatedly reassured and guaranteed that the tunnel systems would be fully fit for their intended purpose and that the installed equipment would be both durable and resilient.  Since the hand-over of the tunnel just over one year ago, there have been a number of individual equipment malfunctions such that this is clearly not the case in all circumstances.  The issue, therefore, is with the durability and reliability of the equipment provided by the contractor.The contractors have been put on notice of legal action to recover all costs arising from deficiencies in the equipment provided.  In addition, further legal action will be pursued for any further failure on the part of the contractor to urgently carry out all necessary works and equipment replacements to deliver the full tunnel systems to the standard required and contracted for.  Where the contractor does not immediately deal with any deficiency in systems or equipment, the NRA will do so itself and pursue recovery of the costs from the contractor in order that costs will lie where they contractually should.

However, it has been open for 15 months and there have been significant failures of the Scada system.  Is that acceptable?  Does the Minister believe the software was properly tested and was the best available internationally?  Is it fit for its purpose?I met the NRA yesterday, was in the tunnel complex and spoke to people there and to the consultants.  They are deeply unhappy with the response from the contractor which installed the equipment and which is not fit for purpose.  They cannot stand over it and they do not know when there will be another glitch.  The contractor is refusing to do any further work on the equipment and that is why the NRA is now proceeding to the legal phase.The difficulty is that each time the tunnel closes, people lose confidence in it.  What will the Minister do to restore confidence in the operation of the tunnel and the equipment therein, particularly the Scada safety system?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	285	What I expect to be done is exactly what the NRA is doing as the contracting party with NMI.  It will pursue this company legally to get it to comply with the terms of its contract.  If the equipment does not meet the standards clearly laid out in the contract, if it will not stand over that and deliver to the terms of its contract, the NRA has the right to go after it legally to get recompense for any loss and, if needs be and it has to do the work itself to ensure there is no reduction in the service, to cover costs.  That is a legal and contractual matter between the NRA and the company concerned.  I am satisfied the NRA is doing everything it legally and physically can do to  ensure these types of incidents, which are totally unacceptable, are eliminated as quickly as possible, or are kept to a minimum until they can be fully eliminated.

Each time there is a failure, the system must be reset manually which is unacceptable.  Does the Minister not think it is time for an independent audit of the system installed and why it was recommended?  Clearly, it is not fit for purpose.  Having spent €750 million on this tunnel, why is it not working after 15 months?  The process of fixing it may take months if the whole system has to be reinstalled.Will the Minister seek from the NRA an independent audit of what is going on in the tunnel which should include possible solutions, costs and time delays?  We must have confidence in the tunnel, which we do not have at present.  The NRA does not have confidence in it and the system in it does not work and could breakdown again tomorrow.

It is best left to the NRA to do these things.  I have every confidence the NRA will pursue this matter.  I agree with the Deputy that it is unacceptable that this should have happened, and continues to happen.  It is a matter for the NRA to pursue to ensure it does not continue.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I have asked Mr. Peter Cassells to consider the disagreement between the Dublin Airport Authority and the Cork Airport Authority on the portion of the overall Cork Airport debt to be borne by the CAA on its separation from the DAA.  Mr. Cassells's brief is to establish whether it is possible for the two boards to resolve their long-standing difference on this core issue.  I have asked him to report to me by 7 March on this matter.My Department is currently considering the business plans prepared by the three airports in the context of their separation into independent entities.  I hope to make progress on this in the near future and in this regard Mr. Cassells's report will be very important.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to comment at this point on the question of the allocation of debt on airport separation.The terms of reference for the engagement of Mr. Cassells are as follows: to facilitate a dialogue between DAA and CAA with a view to finalising details relating to the financial consideration to be paid by the CAA to the DAA in respect of the transfer of assets to the Cork Airport Authority on separation, under the State Airports Act 2004, taking account of the following — the cause of the disagreement between the two boards; the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three State airports under the State Airports Act 2004; Cork Airport's business plan; the DAA's commentary on that business plan and any associated consultants' reports considered relevant; and the need for a speedy resolution of this dispute so that the two boards are in a position to finalise business plans for each airport on a financially sustainable basis under the State Airports Act 2004; and to report to the Minister by Friday, 7 March 2008.

My question was ruled out of order on the basis of semantics, which is regrettable and very undemocratic.  I raised the issue with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on the Order of Business.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I certainly will.A number of reports appeared in the media to the effect that the Minister may be reconsidering the idea of separating Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.  Is it the case that he may decide not to proceed with the provisions of the 2004 Act?  Many commentators have observed that there is no commercial logic to the separation.A pre-election promise was made to the people of Cork that they would not be saddled with a major debt.  Has the Minister accepted, in full, the business plans relating to Cork and Shannon airports?  Does he have a rough idea of what will be the three debt levels?  Would he be concerned that Cork might be left with a debt of anything between €100 million and €200 million, while Shannon might have a debt of €70 million?  It is interesting that Dublin Airport might be obliged to bear a debt of €500 million.  Under its development plan, Dublin will also be obliged to pay out €1.2 billion, a figure that is six times greater than the projected earnings for the airport.  Is the Minister concerned with regard to how matters might develop in the context of the debt issue?A fundamental point was raised in 2004, namely, whether it would be easier for the three airports to carry a substantial debt of this nature, which is basically Transport 21-related debt, together rather than separately?  Are there any circumstances in which the Minister might reconsider the proposal to separate the three airports?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	292	As with so many speculative reports in the newspapers, there is absolutely no truth to the rumour that I am reconsidering the State Airports Act 2004 with a view to not proceeding with the separation.Prior to the general election, the Government made it clear that the restructuring proposed under the State Airport Act would have to be done in a way which would ensure not only that the future viability of Cork Airport would be protected but also that the viability of Shannon and Dublin would also be guaranteed.  The Deputy is correct to state that, in the context of the improvements to be made, a cumulative amount of €1.2 billion — much of which will be carried in the form of a loan — will have to be spent at Dublin Airport.  In such circumstances, every possible source of income must be examined.  The business plans must be considered in the overall context and not just in respect of Cork.Peter Cassells is trying to facilitate dialogue so I will not even speculate as to the levels of debt, if any, each of the airports might be obliged to bear following the conclusion of the process.  It would not be fair to engage in such speculation.The book value of the assets to be transferred to the Cork Airport Authority from the Dublin Airport Authority is some €220 million.  Information from a number of sources indicates that the likely realisable value of those assets would be considerably higher.  In such circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect Cork to pay something towards the costs involved.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	293	Michael O'Leary forcefully expressed the concern many people harbour, namely, that those who travel by air will be obliged to bear the debt — the largest proportion of this will relate to Dublin — that will result from separating the three airports.  Does the Minister share this concern?  He announced that Mr. Cassells will be making his report tomorrow.  Will that report be made public?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	294	As soon as the report is available to me, it will be considered.  It will become public at some stage thereafter.  Mr. Cassells is due to report to me in respect of this matter tomorrow.All airports are funded through charges levied on passengers.  I refer here to landing charges, charges levied by airlines on customers, car park charges, etc.  It is not rocket science to state — as did Mr. O'Leary — that consumers and customers will be obliged to pay for the airports.  These people use the airports and should pay for them.  I do not really know what point Mr. O'Leary was trying to make.From the point of view of the Government and the State, it is important that the facilities at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports should reflect well on our country.  People's first impression is often taken from the airport at which they arrive.  In my opinion, everyone agrees that we should have proper facilities in place.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	295	Plans to introduce competition into the Dublin bus market have not been abandoned.  The Government is committed to the further expansion and enhancement of public bus services and wants a world-class service to be delivered to all citizens.  Moreover, it is wholeheartedly committed to obtaining best value for the travelling public and the taxpayer from significant subsidies being invested by the Exchequer in public bus services operated by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.In order to achieve this, the Government has identified a number of priorities in its programme for Government.  The programme contains a commitment to expedite the establishment of a Dublin transport authority that will have the necessary powers to ensure the delivery of the integrated public transport system, as envisaged under Transport 21.  It is my intention to bring the Dublin transport authority Bill to Cabinet shortly for approval to publish.In terms of the subvented bus market, the Dublin transport authority Bill will set out the mechanisms for the award of contracts for this subvention in line with the new regime introduced under the new EU PSO regulation, which will become mandatory from next year.  The programme for Government also includes a commitment to improving bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932 to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private.It is my intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals.  Any new licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU regulation on public service obligations in the transport sector, which was adopted in 2007 and which will come into force next year.  While it is not possible to indicate a precise time as to when the legislative proposals on regulatory reform of the bus market will be published, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, and the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.

It is similar to that which occurred in respect of driving licences.  A couple of weeks ago, the Minister indicated that he was not in favour of increased competition in the bus market.  It is clear that he is under a great deal of pressure from his colleagues in government, the Progressive Democrats.  The former Minister, Deputy Brennan, was going to increase competition to 25% of the bus market.  Under Deputy Dempsey's immediate predecessor, Deputy Cullen, that figure dropped to 15%.  Prior to today, the Minister's stated policy was that there would not be any further competition in the bus market.  Why the flip-flop?  Why has the Minister changed his mind?  What is the true story and what are the facts?I wonder if the Minister received another ticking off from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who last week stated that he wants to improve public transport capacity by quickly increasing the number of buses on the streets of Dublin.  How can this be done unless the share of the Dublin bus market in respect of which private bus operators can tender is increased?

The statements I have made in this House are statements of policy.  The statements in the programme for Government deal with public transport.  That is the policy I am pursuing.  I have outlined my priorities, on which I intend to deliver, one after the other, which will give us the public transport system we need in Dublin.  The biggest priority has to be delivery of the Dublin transport authority Bill which will be published at the beginning of the next session and on which I look forward to a full discussion, as well as the general issue of public transport in Dublin.  There is no flip-flopping.

When I raised this issue with him some months ago, he said we would have the Bill before Christmas but we did not.  There was another flip flop.  Is it that the Cabinet cannot agree the Bill?  What is the truth of the matter?  He promised it again for early in this session.  As of yesterday I understand we may have it after Easter.  The Minister is not able to deliver to the commuters of Dublin.  He flips when he says we cannot have competition in the bus market and today he flops when he says we can.  He is flipping again on the Dublin transport authority Bill and now has flopped because he has not had it introduced.  He is not doing his job.  All the delays under Transport 21 indicate how the Government is split and how incapable the Minister is of delivering.  He stopped a Bill which had been finalised almost one year ago with everything printed and ready to run.  He is not doing his job.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The recommendations referred to by the Deputy are contained in a report published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, on 28 May 2007.  The report relates to the tragic capsizing and sinking of the fishing vessel the Rising Sun in fishing grounds off the County Wexford coast on 29 November 2005, with the loss of two lives.  I convey again my sympathies to the families on their tragic loss.The Department has examined the MCIB recommendations with a view to addressing any shortcomings in either the statutory basis of the regimes covering fishing vessels or enforcement arrangements.  With regard to recommendation 8.2 to which the Deputy referred, surveys of fishing vessels less than 15 m long are carried out on behalf of the Department of Transport by an approved panel of surveyors.  The Department updated and renewed this panel in 2007, during which year it interviewed applicant surveyors.As part of the interview process, applicants were required to show an understanding of the importance of informing the fishing vessel owners of the necessity to immediately notify the surveying authority of any alterations in equipment or structure or the intended use of their vessel.  Recommendation 8.3 makes reference to the declaration of compliance, recommending that this should include a report of the type of fishing equipment fitted at the time of the survey of the vessel and the intended purpose of the vessel.  The declaration of compliance is contained in an annex to the code of practice in respect of fishing vessels less than 15 m.The Department published the code of practice for the design, construction and equipment of small fishing vessels in 2004.  The code sets minimum standards of safety for the vessel to protect all persons on board.  It covers vessel design, construction, machinery, safety equipment and stability issues.  In 2007 the emphasis was on bringing in safety regulations covering 15-24 m vessels where previously there had been no regulatory regime.  The code for vessels under 15 m is being reviewed and both recommendations, 8.2 and 8.3, will be fully covered in any amendments or improvements to the declaration of compliance.The Department has implemented a comprehensive regulatory framework for fishing vessels to ensure a higher level of safety.  This is being achieved through an approach that separates the fleet into three categories.  The first is less than 15 m in length and would include the Rising Sun, where a non-statutory code of practice is in operation; the other two are 15 to 24 m and over 24 m and in both cases there is now a statutory regime in place.  Fishing vessel safety must rely not only on the introduction of regulations but on compliance with them.  This, in turn, may require not only specific training but also an increasingly rigorous enforcement regime.

The conclusions of the report have been in print for one year and the Minister says that as of today he intends to do something about them but has not done so as yet.  I am unhappy that his Department has not implemented the recommendations in full.  We must hold him to account on this issue. The vessel was overloaded.  The load on the vessel when the certificate was given was changed, making it less stable for the conditions on the day, the equipment on board and so on.  A significant number of other fishing vessels may have been similarly altered.  The purpose of the marine investigation report was that the Department would act and that the documents of compliance and code of practice would reflect any changes that might happen in the life of a boat and what its skipper or owners would make.  Why has the Department not insisted on national compliance with these proposals, published over one year ago, in view of the serious issues involved and the danger posed to other boats?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	329	As I explained to the Deputy, the priority since the publication of this report was to get the regulations in place for the larger 14 to 24 m fishing vessels.  That decision was made in view of the circumstances and because they are likely to have more people on board, with a greater risk for crew.  In that sense I support what the Department has done in prioritising that area.  There was no code for the 15 to 24 m vessels and it was decided to put a regulatory regime in place.  We are now reviewing the code of practice for fishing vessels less than 15 m in length to ensure those recommendations are put in place.In answer to the Deputy, the priority was to put a regulatory regime in place for the 15 to 24 m vessels.  There was already one in place for vessels under 15 m and that will now be reviewed in light of the recommendation.

Of all the boats in this category, since the recommendation was made the Minister has done absolutely nothing.  The Department has failed in its duty of care and it is a disgrace and a shame that it has not happened.  I shall continue to press the Minister as regards progress on this very important and significant matter.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 18 and 35 together.  I refer Deputy O'Dowd to the reply to Priority Question No. 3.Plans to introduce competition into the Dublin bus market have not been abandoned.  The Government is committed to seeing the further expansion and enhancement of public bus services and wants to see a world class service delivered to all citizens.  Moreover, the Government is wholeheartedly committed to getting best value for the travelling public and the taxpayer from significant subsidies being invested by the Exchequer in public bus services operated by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.In order to achieve this, we have identified in the Agreed Programme for Government a number of priorities.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to expedite the establishment of a Dublin transport authority, DTA, which will have the necessary powers to ensure the delivery of the integrated public transport system envisioned under Transport 21.  It is my intention to bring the Dublin transport authority Bill to Cabinet shortly for approval to publish early next session.In terms of the subvented bus market, the DTA Bill will set out the mechanisms for the award of contracts for this subvention in line with the new regime introduced under the new EU public service obligations, PSO, regulation, which will become mandatory from next year.The programme for Government also includes a commitment to improving bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private.  It is my intention that plans for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals.  Any new licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU regulation on PSO in the transport sector, which was adopted in 2007 and will come into force next year.While it is not possible to indicate a precise time as to when the legislative proposals on regulatory reform of the bus market will be published, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, and the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.

Opening up the bus market is an important issue and we all support it.  Allowing people to tender for a franchise is very important.  In that context, I believe the State subsidy for Bus Éireann is €60 million a year, but I will stand corrected if the figure is not right.  The point is that we do not know how many of those buses are PSOs.  We need to know which routes are PSO and which are not, so that there is fair and proper competition.  We must protect the interests of the taxpayer.If private operators are prepared to tender openly for a franchise or a route, they need to have an opportunity to bid for PSO routes as well, if necessary.  The key principle of Government, with which I have no problem, is that a significant proportion must be protected by keeping it in the hands of Dublin Bus.  I have no difficulty with that.  However, new commuters from conurbations around Dublin need more buses.  Bus Éireann cannot provide them, so private operators are entitled to compete and get into the market.  The quicker the legislation is in place the happier we shall be.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	335	Currently a private operator can submit a licence application for any route he or she believes money is to be made on.  There is no problem about that.  In recent years in particular, the Department has tried to streamline procedures.  The 1932 Act, to which the Deputy refers, is very outdated.  It is very much a subjective type of approach to bus licensing, there are no appeals mechanisms and neither are there are any real penalties for those in breach of it.  It requires reform.As I told the Deputy earlier, in this whole area of public transport we need to prioritise.  To attempt to do everything at once is a recipe for failure.  It would be a help to have the DTA in place to allow it to regulate the bus market and check out a number of the areas the Deputy touched on.  I have impressed on both Dublin Bus and its unions that the people in the greater Dublin area, and indeed Ireland, want an efficient and effective public transport system.  As Minister I must ensure that taxpayers, who are paying the subvention — more than €300 million between all the CIE companies — get value for money.I have a difficulty and it is something we are investigating in parallel to the DTA preparations, and the Deputy is right about this.  I should know, and so should CIE and the taxpayer, which routes need to be subvented, and which do not.  We are trying to find this out currently, and I am very committed.  While people talk to me about the London model of public transport, I tend to look further afield.  There is a good German model, which is a largely public sector-owned transport system.  We have something of a mix, and that is no harm.  However, my current priorities are to get the DTA in place, ensuring we get value for money, and reforming the 1932 Act, and I shall take them in that order.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	336	Fianna Fáil has been in Government for 11 years.  First, we heard Deputy O'Rourke as Minister for Public Enterprise, followed by Deputy Brennan, then Deputy Cullen and now Deputy Dempsey talk about a Dublin transport authority.  These were 11 long wasted years and people are still waiting at the bus stop.  The person waiting at the bus stop does not care about the right wing ideology proffered today by Fine Gael, or by the Minister.  All they want is to get the bus.  The Minister's right wing ideology, backed up by the Progressive Democrats, has held up the development of the fleets of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  Before the general election, the Labour Party proposed an increase in the fleet by at least 50%, or 500 buses, to ensure all new areas of the city, and other cities such as Cork and Limerick, would have an adequate service.  However, the Government dithered repeatedly.We will not be considering the Dublin Transport Authority Bill this session and the Minister is going to Australia.  Will the Bill be introduced after Easter?  The Minister is now talking about another Bill.  He told CIE one thing and The Sunday Business
Post another, and he is now telling us something different.  All in all, nothing has been achieved.  We want to get the buses on the road because, as the Minister knows, we must depend on them until major infrastructure comes on stream in 2015.  Only buses can provide the backbone of public transport and it is the Minister’s job to provide them.  He should forget about the ideology, be it that of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats, and get the fleet up to scratch.  Let us have a decent fleet.  At present, people are waiting for such a fleet in Swords, which is likely to have 100,000 people, Blanchardstown, Tallaght, other parts of Dublin, the north and south of Cork city, Limerick and Galway.  The routes are frozen and the State bus company is not allowed to add to its fleet.I remind Deputy O'Dowd that the subsidy to Dublin Bus is the lowest given to any major operator in the European Union.  It is the Minister's job to provide the buses to transport passengers to work, school or hospital.  He should stop dithering and talking.  We could have passed the relevant legislation 11 years ago and, therefore, what is happening is a complete nonsense.

Neither I nor the Deputy knows the answer to that and I will not spend taxpayers' money — €250,000 on every bus and €80,000 in current expenditure — until I know I am getting value for the buses currently in operation.I agree with the Deputy that we need a good bus service.  We need more routes, including radial and orbital routes, and we need to ensure that when we commence the works in the city centre under Transport 21, we will have a bus service we can stand over and which will accommodate passengers throughout the city.We want to try to keep the traffic in the city flowing.  The only way this can be achieved is through a flexible public transport system with flexible works, not with nonsense involving 25 or 30 buses parked on Marlborough Street, Parnell Square or O'Connell Street taking up road space while the drivers go to have a cup of tea.  That is not the kind of service I want to provide.  Most people do not want that, be they employed by Dublin Bus or another organisation.  I want a good, efficient, economical bus service that can be delivered to the public with flexibility.  This is what the public wants and what I will give it.

This has been operating very successfully and is not in conflict with any other service.  Given the reforms taking place, the fact that we are adopting an alternative approach and the fact that an application for a licence has been lodged with the Department for some time, flexibility should be afforded in this case.  Although the operator does not have a licence, the service provides a link to the airport and is not in conflict with another route.Metro West is to extend as far as Tallaght.  Can I use the name "Tallaght" in the presence of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Charlie O'Connor?  I believe he has a copyright on it.  It has been argued that Metro West should extend from Tallaght to Sandyford so there would be connectivity with the Luas.  The Minister spoke of radial links and this is one that needs to be extended entirely around the city.

It makes a mockery of the transport system that an excellent and very effective service by a private operator must operate illegally.  The Minister said the last reform he will introduce will be to the 1932 Act but it should be the first.I agree with the Minister in that I do not care whether the bus is red, white or blue.  It is important to passengers that there be buses available, that we protect the interests of the taxpayer and that the buses in place operate effectively and efficiently.  If this is right-wing thinking, I am all in favour of it because it looks after the consumer, the traveller and the ordinary person.  All the other ideologies, such as the Kremlin ideologies, are long gone.  I do not know if Deputy Broughan knows that even Russia has changed.Private operators applied to use the Dublin Port tunnel but it took a very long time to grant permission.  When Dublin Bus wanted to use it, it was not allowed to do so.  The whole system is a joke.  Any bus that wants to use the tunnel should be allowed to do so, provided it can pass through it.  The stops should be at the bus stops and not in the tunnel.Let us have a modern, dynamic transport system in Dublin.  Let us free up the market and have competition and let us have people in buses rather than cars.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 12 together.It is my Department's policy to strongly support the role of park and ride facilities in encouraging people to transfer from private cars to public transport.  In 2002, a DTO study on bus-based park and ride concluded that it has only a limited role to play in Dublin because of the city's size and consequent distances.  Nonetheless, where there is a sound business case, my Department will consider funding appropriate bus-based park and ride facilities.In 2005, my predecessor endorsed a DTO plan for rail-based park and ride in the greater Dublin area.  This plan envisages a network of new or improved parking facilities at 22 sites on the existing and proposed rail network in the greater Dublin area.Under Transport 21, funding is available for the development of park and ride facilities by Iarnród Éireann, the RPA and local authorities in the greater Dublin area and the regional cities, either as stand-alone projects or as part of larger rail-based investments.Some €5 million was made available to local authorities in the greater Dublin area in 2006 for park and ride facilities, with a further €1 million in both 2007 and 2008.  No applications for this funding were received in 2006 or 2007.  I am currently awaiting proposals from local authorities for 2008 spending.In 2006, over €10.9 million was made available to Iarnród Eireann for park and ride facilities at its stations in both the greater Dublin area and in the regions, while €4.1 million was available for this purpose in 2007.No specific figures are available for Luas sites as park and ride site costs are included in their overall project budgets.In 2006, €2.6 million was paid to Iarnród Éireann to carry out two feasibility studies to examine 34 station car parks in order to develop a prioritised investment programme, as well as for upgrading and increasing the capacity of rail station car parks and to progress planning and design work at a number of stations identified in the studies above.  In 2007, some €3.7 million was paid to Iarnród Éireann to upgrade and expand the capacity of rail station car parks and as approved projects are completed, additional funding is being provided.The park and ride sites associated with the proposed Luas and Metro lines in Transport 21 will open at the same time that the lines open for passenger services.  These sites are determined by the RPA when individual railway order applications are submitted for the various lines and the cost of park and ride facilities is included in the overall budgets for the relevant lines.I am awaiting proposals from local authorities in the greater Dublin area in respect of funding for park and ride facilities for the current year.Funding is available to the local authorities in the regional cities for bus priority and park and ride measures.  It is a matter for the local authorities to prioritise projects and apply to my Department for funding.  To date under Transport 21, the local authorities in these cities have been focused on developing bus priority, which is an essential prerequisite for the operation of successful bus-based park and ride facilities.

I live in Gorey, as he may or may not know.  It is a pity that they did not spend some of the €2.6 million and €3.7 million on building the car park instead of putting together a feasibility study on it.There is a lack of foresight.  The Minister did not really discuss the matter of a bus-based park and ride facility.  There are a number of people who are able to drive the 40 or 50 miles to get to the periphery of the city — I refer primarily to Dublin.  One gets to the periphery of this city in less than an hour and then one spends the next hour——

The Minister touched on it, but I did not catch exactly what he said.A significant cost must be borne by the State, whether through the land being in State possession or the State having to purchase the land, to make available large open-space car parks on the periphery of the city and then to make the buses available from the car parks via the bus lanes into the city.  One only travels five to seven miles in the last 90 minutes in the car and any of us who travel from the countryside to this House realise that is the problem.  I am sure the Acting Chairman does so.

I have been disappointed with the lack of progress on precisely the kind of park and ride facilities he mentioned.  I am not sure that the study completed in 2002, which seemed to pour a little cold water on the idea of bus-based park and rides, still holds true at this stage and I have asked officials in the Department to examine this matter.  We all come from the greater Dublin area, one way or another, and given the increase in population and traffic, the issue should be revisited.The committee questioned the county managers recently.  I would dearly like to see more park and ride facilities in the vicinity of Dublin, even as far out as Deputy D'Arcy suggests.  People do not want to sit in their cars for a period of time.  If one can get to a bus, rail or Luas station, such facilities should be available.  People will leave their cars there and as the transport system improves in the city, including with buses, they will increasingly use such facilities.One element of it is park and ride and when those facilities are available where the Deputy suggests, one needs the frequent regular bus service that uses the bus lanes.  Once people have that certainty, they will move forward.South County Dublin County Council submitted a significant application for a park and ride facility but it was shot down because it was not in accordance with the development plan.  I was disappointed, but it was a matter for the board which had its reasons.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to fast-track this issue.

One would never know what could happen.  Perhaps private enterprise could become involved.  People are sitting on money out there because they are not prepared to go into the residential construction business at present.  Perhaps there is an opportunity in this area, whether through a PPP or through Government backing.  If the land belongs to the State and if somebody is prepared to open up such a facility, we could save thousands of man hours through people not having to sit in their cars.

When people try to pursue a development with CIE, it passes the matter on to the local authority and vice versa.  Does the Minister agree that up until recently, there was no coherence in this regard?The Joint Committee on Transport discussed this matter with eight county managers including four managers from Dublin and one from Meath.  Has the Minister taken a similar initiative to encourage them to take action?  The point was made earlier that we must provide regular and swift bus services from park and ride facilities.  I was interested to hear the South Dublin County Manager had applied for a bus licence to operate the park and ride facility from the park.  Would the Minister encourage this type of action?What level of funding is provided under Transport 21 for park and ride facilities?

I will take up the matter with An Bord Pleanála although in a general sense only and not in terms of specifics.On Deputy Broughan's point, I agree that some councils on the periphery of Dublin and some of the Dublin councils have been playing pass the parcel a little in respect of this issue being one for the transport company rather than them.  However, that has changed.  I have spoken with the CCMA, the representative body of managers, and have emphasised the need for integrated thinking in respect of transport in terms of park and ride facilities, etc..Deputy Broughan referred to the application by South Dublin County Manager, Mr. Joe Horan, for a bus licence.  Cork County Council has licensed a bus operator and the service is operating successfully on a public private partnership, PPP, basis.On Deputy D'Arcy's point, I will pursue with the NRA and local authorities whether there are parcels of land available that might be suitable for the type of facilities mentioned.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	390	Government policy on industrial relations is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Industrial relations are primarily a matter for the parties involved and I have no function in this regard.  There is a well-established structure for resolution of industrial relations disputes between employers and employees through the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.I assume the Deputy is referring in particular to the recent dispute concerning air traffic controllers employed by the Irish Aviation Authority.  I note that the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court promptly assisted the parties in seeking to resolve the issues in dispute.  I understand a Labour Court recommendation issued on 25 February is being considered by both parties.  I hope the dispute can be resolved quickly on the basis of that recommendation.I am informed that the IAA has a continuity of service agreement in place with staff which conforms to the Labour Relations Commission code of practice on dispute procedures including procedures in essential services.  The agreement which is renewed every three years provides for local internal negotiations in the first instance, followed by referral of outstanding disputes to the Labour Relations Commission-Labour Court.  The agreement provides that no strikes or other action designed to bring pressure to bear on either party should take place while the parties are working through the procedures.  Where strike notice is being served on the IAA, a minimum notice period of 14 days is required.In the event of strike action by air traffic controllers, the IAA has in place contingency safety arrangements for the management of Irish airspace.  These arrangements provide that en route airspace will remain open, without Irish air traffic controller input, so that overflying traffic would not be affected.  Emergency traffic would also be accommodated at Irish airports.  However, under current arrangements a strike would inevitably result in disruption to traffic to and from State and regional airports.Clearly there has been some disruption to air services due to recent action by air traffic controllers but this should be the exception rather than the rule as such action is contrary to the continuity of service agreement.   I understand that the agreement is due to be reviewed in September 2008 and I expect that the IAA will consider the improvements needed to ensure effective continuity of service in the light of recent experience.In respect of the three State airports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon, I understand that the Dublin Airport Authority has an agreement in place with the union side that deals with such contingencies.  The agreement which is registered with the Labour Court provides for a no strike clause in respect of potential industrial action by the fire and police emergency services during the lifetime of the agreement.  Issues relating to the scope or alteration of the agreement are resolved through the normal third party mechanisms and, if necessary, through binding recommendation of the Labour Court.   In the event of an air traffic control dispute, the DAA has arrangements in place to manage the impact on passengers to protect their safety and security in the airport in the event of sudden flight cancellations.

Obviously, the air traffic controllers are not party to this agreement.  We must ensure, through the negotiating system and the national talks on partnership that key transport workers, like air traffic controllers, are party to a no strike clause in whatever agreements are reached.  Other key workers in the transport industry at Dublin Airport are party to such an agreement.Potential strikes, particularly in the aviation industry, affect hundreds of thousands of people.  There are almost 800 flights per day in and out of this country.  Thousands of people were affected by the recent air traffic controllers threatened strike.  They had to change their travel dates and could not do the business they were scheduled to do on the day causing them great uncertainty.  We are a modern dynamic economy and we must ensure that key transport workers such as air traffic controllers cannot strike.  We must ensure in this regard that there is in place an agreement such as that already negotiated for other workers in the same industry.

Any disagreement should be resolved through the established channels.  That applies to Aer Lingus, air traffic controllers and the IAA.  On the specific question raised by Deputy O'Dowd, I agree that it would be useful if, when dealing with something as essential as the air traffic control system, a genuine no strike clause could be inserted and fully adhered to by all sides.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	397	The suggestions for consideration that the Courts Service sets out in its submission to my Department are predicated on a fixed charge sum having the same legal status as a monetary fine imposed by a court following conviction of an offence.  This is not the case.  Therefore, on those grounds, most of the suggestions made are not legally feasible.  It must be borne in mind that the fixed charge system applies to offences that come under the criminal law system.  The vital distinction is that whereas a fine levied by a court following conviction is a monetary penalty, that is, a debt amount due and owed by the person concerned, a fixed charge is an amount that a person may opt to pay in lieu of being prosecuted in court.  A person is not under a legal obligation to pay a fixed charge.I appreciate that the Courts Service is seeking to reduce the number of fixed charge offences going into the court prosecution system where a fixed charge has not been paid within the statutory 56-day period.  The suggestion that a fixed charge be automatically owed and that an onus should be placed on the recipient of a fixed charge notice to indicate that he or she wishes to go to court as opposed to having this the default position is to be examined, as is the feasibility of the suggestion that a driver licence number be recorded when a car is being taxed.More generally, my Department has written to the Courts Service recently and all other stakeholder agencies and Departments involved in the road safety strategy to elicit any and all suggestions for possible inclusion in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill that I will be progressing in the latter half of this year.  Suggestions received from agencies, including the Courts Service, such as the issues I have referred to, will be the subject of consultation between my officials and the other agencies concerned.

Each one of those cases proceeded through the District Court.  Probably about 160,000 cases came before the District Courts in the past 12 months.  This means that they cannot cope and the entire system is breaking down.  Up to 500,000 notices could be issued per annum following the introduction of speed cameras.  Unless the Minister changes the system, the courts system simply will not work.  The most significant problem is caused by the cohorts who do not pay their fines and decide to go to court.  Of these, about 125,000 do not have a driving licence and about 10,000 do not have insurance.  About 3,000 or 4,000 are caught driving with a mobile phone in their hand.  A significant cohort is are escaping.  If one does not pay one's fine, a summons will not be served.  In the order of 40,000 court summonses were not delivered in the first six months of last year.  The process needs urgent and radical reform; otherwise, the court system will grind to a halt and those who deserve it most will get away with everything.

We have since met at the North-South Ministerial Council.  The matter was discussed at each of those meetings.  A tripartite meeting with my counterpart in the United Kingdom, Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick, and Ms Arlene Foster will probably take place in early April to finalise the timescale.In the context of a new road traffic Bill, the suggestions the Courts Service has made which have been reiterated by Deputy O'Dowd will be considered.  There may be a difficulty posed by a person's constitutional right to go to court.  We must look at this issue.On the point made about the use of licence numbers, I am in favour of any system that will get us to a position where the maximum information can be obtained.  The legislation should be in place in order that driving licence numbers, PPS numbers and so on can be used across systems for these purposes.  Obviously, that is not within my direct remit but the issue needs to be discussed and finalised.  It would help to streamline systems.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

I wish to share my time with Deputy Wall.When the Labour Party was last in government, it sanctioned in 1996 the redevelopment of Naas General Hospital.  There have been major improvements at the hospital since in all aspects of the delivery of health services to the people of County Kildare.  The final phase of the redevelopment of the hospital includes the provision of two additional 31-bed wards, additional physiotherapy and occupational services facilities and a catering unit for 255 patients and 800 staff.  The final phase was to commence construction in 2004 but Government funding was not forthcoming.  In 2005, when the HSE sought permission to seek tenders for the project, the Government did not give the required approval.  The go-ahead was given in 2007.  A lengthy tender process was undertaken and late that year a tender report was forwarded to the capital section of the HSE with a recommendation on the appointment of the preferred contractor.  The board of the HSE met on 14 February this year and the draft capital plan for 2008 which has been submitted to the Minister for Health and Children does not include phase 3C.  The plan requires the approval of the Minister and the Department of Finance.We have now had four years of Government promises.  On Monday of this week there were 16 patients on trolleys in Naas General Hospital; on Tuesday, 31; on Wednesday, 23, and today, 21.  Nobody deserves to be treated in such an undignified manner.  The provision of additional hospital beds under phase 3C would eliminate this practice.  I, therefore, call on the Minister to change the draft capital plan for 2008 and include the final phase of the redevelopment of Naas General Hospital.It is obvious that the Government which is preoccupied by tribunals and an internal leadership struggle has taken its eye off the ball.  The economy is floundering as a result.  As usual, the people who will suffer most are those most in need.  While the Government gives tax breaks to its friends for private hospitals for the rich, ordinary citizens are left on trolleys in public areas of Naas General Hospital.  There seems to be plenty of money available to support the Government's rich pals.I state clearly that the Labour Party will campaign until this decision is reversed.  I call on my constituency colleagues on the Government side of the House to support my campaign and that of Deputy Wall.  Before the general election last May, the Government promised that phase 3C, the final phase of the redevelopment of Naas General Hospital, would proceed.  It is time to put up or shut up.

I recently contacted staff at the hospital about a very serious and difficult case that had occurred overseas in which I was trying to assist.  I was delighted with the excellent reply I received.  Recent visits to the hospital show how much the new hospital means to the patients, the staff and the general public.  As my colleague has stated, it is unfortunate to see how the use of trolleys has taken away from the overall project.  The loss to the area of physiotherapy and occupational therapy services is significant.  County Kildare and west Wicklow have seen a significant increase in population.This is a draft capital plan with the possibility that Naas can be included.  We are asking on behalf of our constituents that the Minister and the HSE reconsider and ensure that Naas hospital is completed to allow it to develop as a hospital of excellence for the people of Kildare and west Wicklow.

I thank Deputies Stagg and Wall for raising the issue.Over recent years, considerable funding has been made available for the completion of capital projects at Naas General Hospital.  In 2003, a major €75 million capital project was completed at the hospital which included four 31-bed wards; six-bed coronary care unit; four-bed intensive care unit; three operating theatres; accident and emergency and out-patient departments; radiology department; pathology department; pharmacy department; and a department of medicine for older people which included a day hospital and rehabilitation-assessment ward.In 2007, capital funding under the accident and emergency special initiative provided a seven-place medical assessment unit and a ten-bed transit unit.  A central sterile stores department is also being provided at a cost of €3.8 million.In drawing up its capital plan, the Health Service Executive is required to prioritise the projects to be progressed within its overall capital funding allocation.  The HSE has been finalising its capital plan over recent weeks on this basis.  A revised draft of the plan has now been completed and has just been made available to the Department for approval in the normal way.The draft capital plan reflects the HSE's commitments and priorities.  The HSE is currently reviewing a number of options to enable it to progress further capital projects over the coming years and proposals in this regard are awaited by the Department.  The capital plan will be published as a whole upon approval.  It is not productive to release information about the status of individual projects in advance of that.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity of raising this very important issue.  It seems to be all bad news with regard to the health service.  I seek a clear commitment from the Minister of State that the €39 million redevelopment of Ennis General Hospital will proceed.  At least in the case of Naas General Hospital, a €75 million project was completed in 2003 but we have not seen any money like that in Ennis General Hospital.The Ennis Hospital Development Committee has on occasions been accused of scaremongering.  However, the constant downgrading and withdrawal of services from County Clare does little to dispel the fear that there is a hidden agenda to reduce Ennis hospital to little more than a first aid injury clinic.  At a meeting with the Minister for Health and Children which I attended on 20 September 2007, she indicated that this development would proceed.  When the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, visited Ennis in May, prior to the general election of course, he was happy to show up for the photocall announcing that the development had progressed to planning, saying that it "symbolises Fianna Fáil's ongoing commitment to safeguarding and developing the health services available to the people of County Clare".I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question on 31 January 2007 and I have been advised in writing by the HSE that the review of the acute services in the mid-west is to be published shortly and that this review is likely to have significant implications for capital developments for the foreseeable future.  Furthermore, I have heard from reliable sources that this review is likely to recommend that this project does not proceed or that it could be delayed.  Alarm bells are ringing and I have grave concerns.  The drip by drip leaking of reports and the downgrading by stealth of services in County Clare is an emergency health warning to the people of Clare that a decision has already been made with regard to Ennis General Hospital.The population of County Clare is 103,277, with more than 44,000 of the county's population outside the golden hour travelling time away from an accident and emergency department.  Over 25,000 tourists stay in County Clare overnight during the summer season and Shannon International Airport is on our doorstep, handling 3.4 million passengers.  It is also the designated emergency airport for all western traffic.  This seems to matter little to this Government which has presided over the downgrading of health services in our county.The HSE's vision for 2010 as outlined in its Transformation Programme 2007-2010 of easy access, confidence and staff pride, meant nothing to the three expectant mothers living in west Clare when no ambulance was available to transfer them to Limerick Maternity Hospital.  The ambulance service in County Clare is under-resourced and clearly understaffed.  The staff are working in appalling conditions and must clean out their ambulances with a mop and bucket.  The vision of easy access means nothing to the women of Clare who, following the closure of mammography services in County Clare may now face up to a two-year delay for a publicly funded mammogram in Limerick.  It means nothing to those patients in County Clare who, following the closure of the rheumatology services at Ennis, cannot meet with a rheumatologist in Limerick because one consultant cannot possibly handle the numbers.The lives of people who live in Clare, especially in west Clare, who suffer major traumas will be put at further unnecessary risk as they will not receive emergency treatment in time following the decision to bypass Ennis for all such cases from April next. Access to Limerick Regional Hospital at certain times of the day is a disaster.  If the bypassing of Ennis hospital is not reversed then at the very least an air ambulance service should be provided for west Clare and the Kilrush ambulance station must be upgraded with extra staff and two permanent APTs in the station at all times.Ennis General Hospital is essential for life-saving and stabilising emergency care.  This is been undermined and people's lives been put at risk because there is no CAT scanner in the hospital.  When a CAT scanner was approved for the hospital it was an outdated machine, not a 16 slice scanner as is required.  Very little progress has been made in installing a scanner.  I raised this matter in the Dáil last year.The centre of excellence in Limerick cannot cope with the extra number of patients who are arriving on their doorstep following the closure of some services at Ennis and Nenagh.  The withdrawal of acute beds from Ennis and Nenagh will add 57% to Limerick's acute bed numbers, if accident and emergency department closures proceed.  With leaks emanating that accident and emergency services are also to close at St. John's Hospital in Limerick, I question how are they going to cope with the extra numbers.A total of 5,000 people marched on the streets of Ennis last September to urge this Government to sit up and listen.  The health service is a shambles in County Clare.  The tactics of withdrawing by stealth services from County Clare with no alternative in place is unacceptable.  In 2000, €20.9 million was promised to develop Ennis.  In 2005, five years later, the Minister announced the investment.  This Government is great at turning sods and showing up for photoshoots.  However, eight years on, there is no sod turning ceremony for Ennis and nothing but downgrading for the hospital.I am asking the Minister of State for a firm commitment that the €39 million promised to redevelop Ennis General Hospital will be given, no matter what the report on the acute health services recommends for the region.

The HSE has advised the Department that breast imaging services are available at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick through a breast clinic which provides rapid access for all women with breast symptoms.  The HSE has also advised that mammography scheduling is based on clinical need and referrals to the breast clinic are assessed, prioritised and subsequently referred to the radiology department for imaging.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I am sure the Minister of State will have appropriate, correct and good news for me.There has been a long-standing problem with gaelscoil Bharra, an all-Irish school established in 1996 which has been in operation for more than 12 years.  It was established in prefabricated buildings because there was nothing else there.  Little did the students, parents and staff think that 12 years down the road they would still be in the same old dilapidated prefabricated buildings.  These prefabricated buildings have been in use for considerably longer than the length of time for which they were designed.  The classrooms are in a dreadful condition.  They are not fit for human habitation and are certainly not fit to accommodate primary schoolchildren.The toilets are blocked on a regular basis.  The schoolyard gets flooded every time it rains and urgently needs to be resurfaced.  We badly need a new school for the 230 pupils and staff.  This has been repeatedly promised, but nothing has happened.  The school has identified four classrooms as being particularly bad and made a proposal to the Minister to replace these four classrooms and resurface the schoolyard.  The cost of that work would be approximately €400,000.  The only reply the school has received is that the cost should be taken from the minor grant of €10,000 for remedial works.  It would take approximately 40 years to pay that off without any interest.A major protest was planned to be held in Parnell Square in the run-up to the 2002 election.  It was called off at the last minute because the Taoiseach promised in writing to the school that the matter would be resolved and that he was 100% behind the parents, pupils and staff in getting a brand new school building.  Strangely there has been no contact with the Taoiseach since that time, which is now almost six years ago.  Every effort made by the staff and parents to meet the Taoiseach has failed.  Although they managed to meet the Minister for Education and Science in 2003, that meeting did not achieve anything either.At present pupils and staff are condemned to spend approximately six hours of each day in an unhealthy and damp building where the sewage comes up from the toilet and where the yard is flooded every time it rains.  It really is not good enough that it has gone on for 12 years.  On several occasions I have tabled parliamentary questions.  The answer I got last week to a parliamentary question was an atrocious five-liner.  Previous answers ran to approximately 20 lines containing some sort of explanation.  The responses from the Department of Education and Science are getting even poorer.  At least in the past we got assurances that the Department was seeking a fresh site or was preparing to build on the existing site.  Now there is not even reference to that.  All we get is a general reference to the multi-annual budget of the Department of Education and Science, with no mention of the construction of a replacement for these appalling buildings.I would like to get something positive.  The school is not going away.  It has proved its viability and more pupils are coming in every year.  I would like a positive commitment to a new school for the pupils of the area.

Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.The Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme to almost €600 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the NDP almost €4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.  It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas, while continuing to develop on the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post primary accommodation throughout the country.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.On this specific matter, the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in site acquisitions generally, had been requested to source a greenfield site for this school.  On foot of advertising, no proposals were received for a greenfield site in the Cabra area.  Further to this, the OPW was requested by the Department to consider building a permanent school on the existing site.  A number of issues have arisen regarding this proposal on which, I understand, clarification is being sought.  When progress has been made, the school authorities will be notified immediately.I again the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the future plans for gaelscoil Bharra.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter of great importance arising for the most part from a recent case which has once again adverted to the lack of importance placed on the role of the victim in the criminal justice system.  It is true to say that over the years the victim had few or no rights in this system.  In 1993, the introduction of the victim impact statement was a most welcome development.  For the first time it gave victims — or in manslaughter cases, their families — an opportunity to articulate how a crime had affected them.  The victim impact statement empowers victims or their families, allowing them to play a part in the administration of justice, rather than forcing them to be mere passive observers.  Fine Gael has been pushing for some time for greater rights for victims.  Earlier this year, we published a Private Members' Bill which aims substantially to enhance the rights of victims within the criminal justice system.  I am hopeful that the Bill will receive cross-party support when it comes before the House later this year.  In the interim period, however, the conclusion of the Kearney case this week has thrown up important issues that the Oireachtas must consider urgently.The late Siobhán Kearney's family did not have an opportunity to read out their victim impact statement in the court because the law does not facilitate such a procedure in murder cases.  The rationale here is that the victim impact statement should help the judge to determine a sentence where he or she has discretion.  In murder cases there is no discretion because a mandatory sentence applies, so some would argue that a victim impact statement is unnecessary.  I disagree with this approach, however, as do my colleagues in Fine Gael.  We believe that the victim impact statement fulfils a greater role than just informing the judge.  A victim impact statement is an important opportunity for victims, or their families, to stitch into the public record the impact that a crime, as committed, has had on their lives.  The statement plays a vital role in helping victims and their families to find closure on a horrific experience.  It is an inclusive measure that transforms victims or their loved ones into participants in our criminal justice system, rather than forcing them to be passive observers.Would it have made a difference to the sentence handed down to Brian Kearney if Siobhán's family had been allowed to make a victim impact statement?  The answer is "No", but it would have made a difference to her family.  This is evidenced by the fact that her family felt the need to read their statement outside the court.  They wanted their voices to be heard and, indeed, today's papers gave the statement much coverage.  In my view it is most regrettable that the Government has failed to recognise the value of victim impact statements.  There must be more to such statements than mere process and procedure.  Victim impact statements are about making our justice system inclusive and humane.Fine Gael is calling again on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform to take these issues on board.  I hope the opportunity that now presents itself will not be ignored by the Government.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I thank Deputy Charles Flanagan for raising this important issue and I am grateful for the opportunity to address it.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is conscious of the need to support victims of crime in their contacts with our criminal justice system.Over the past few years, this Government has taken steps to ensure that the victim has a central place in the criminal justice system.  In 2005, we established the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, with a remit to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures.  I pay a warm tribute to that commission for all the work it has achieved over the past three years.  Its work is much appreciated by voluntary bodies that provide practical assistance to victims of crime and their families.Since 2005, the commission has provided funding close to €2.5 million to over 40 groups engaged in the support of victims of crime.  I understand that the commission is currently considering applications for 2008 from some 55 voluntary organisations.  This will lead to the expenditure of a further €1 million this year to organisations supporting victims of crime.  One of the most important services funded by the commission has been for the purpose of court accompaniment, where victims of crime are assisted by trained voluntary personnel in getting to understand the criminal court procedures, and where victims or their families have a friendly face to accompany them throughout any trial.The Minister met with the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime and has been advised that it has made considerable progress in devising an appropriate support framework for victims of crime in future.  Only last week the commission held a well-attended discussion day with victims' organisations at which the elements of such a future framework were frankly discussed.  Arising from those discussions, the commission expects to be in a position to present its findings to the Minister shortly.  This document will provide important insights into how support for victims of crime might be developed into the future, including the steps that would be necessary to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government to establish a statutory victims agency and advisory council.In September 1999, a new and comprehensive victims charter and guide to the criminal justice system was published, which set out the rights and entitlements to services and the levels and standards of treatment which crime victims could reasonably expect.  The charter operated from the time of publication with clear complaint procedures whereby if the victim's expectations were not met or where the level of service was not as set out in the charter, complaints could be lodged.  This charter is currently under review by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime and a revised charter is expected to be published shortly.Victim impact statements are among the most effective mechanisms available to ensure that the interests and concerns of victims of crime are brought to bear on the criminal justice process.  Section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides that a court, before passing sentence, is required to take into account any effect, whether long-term or otherwise, of the offence on the person in respect of whom the offence was committed.  This is one of the rare instances where the court is specifically directed as to a matter to be taken into account at the sentencing stage.  Otherwise, courts — other than in murder cases — have a large measure of discretion as to the matters to be considered in the context of determining the appropriate sentence.  As a result of the procedure under section 5 of the 1993 Act, victims can expect to have a level of involvement beyond that of a mere witness.In recent times, a certain amount of attention has been given to the role of victim impact statements.  The Minister has already undertaken that, following reflection on this complex issue, he may, if considered necessary and appropriate, bring forward proposals which will address any defect in the current arrangements or which may enhance further the role of the victim.  In that context account will have to be taken not only of public debate on the matter, but it will also include consideration of the very helpful comments made by the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan SC, in its report earlier this year.As regards the current arrangements under section 5 of the 1993 Act, the review group suggests the section may be too restrictive in so far as it permits a statement by or on behalf of the direct victim only.  It suggests there is a case for expanding the definition of "victim" to include other persons intimately affected by the crime, such as would be the position in homicide cases where a close relative of the victim is, at the court's discretion, permitted to make or provide a statement.The review group also discusses the possible use of victim impact statements at the parole or remission stage and places this issue in the context of restorative justice — that is, that the victim would have an opportunity to address the perpetrator directly, to make him or her realise more fully the harm that has been done.The National Commission on Restorative Justice, with Judge Mary Martin as chair, was established in 2007 to examine both national and international practices in restorative justice, to consider the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee's report on restorative justice, and to consider what model or models of restorative justice might be appropriate to Irish circumstances.

All passenger boats are engaged on domestic voyages within the State either on inland lakes or rivers or to sea. Passenger boats are required to comply with Statutory Instrument No. 273 of 2002 Merchant Shipping (Passenger Boat) Regulations, which entered into force in June of 2002 and passenger boat certification/licensing was provided for on a regulated basis therein.A passenger ship is a vessel, which carries more than twelve passengers. Passenger ships include both international and domestic passenger ships. There are no international passenger ships flying the Irish flag and all Irish passenger ships currently operate on domestic voyages both on inland waters and to sea.  Passenger ships are required to comply with a very extensive body of merchant shipping legislation, which is being further developed by the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, which will be published this year.I am in a position to provide numbers of passenger boats and ships that were certified from 2000 to date.YearBoatsShips200019612320012121252002200120200320013020041801122005235114200616499200724079In relation to the number of breaches of such certificates for each year, actions taken and the results of same I must point out that this is a complicated matter which involves the other enforcement agencies of the State in addition to the officers of my Department. These other organisations include amongst others An Garda Síochána and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs who fund a number of the passenger ships under their PSO provision.In general, Irish passenger ships and boats are operated to a high standard. However, all domestic passenger ships are subject to unannounced inspections by Surveyors from my Department during the year to ensure continued compliance with the requirements and that they are being operated safely. Enforcement actions can include the Surveyor issuing deficiency notices against the ship with set deadlines for rectification, more serious deficiencies may result in the detention of a ship and in some serious cases a prosecution may be taken against the skipper and/or owner of the vessel. Additionally, complaints may be received from members of the public and my officials follow-up on all of these and take additional action as necessary. For example in 2007 all of the domestic passenger ships were subject to the unannounced inspections, and one prosecution was taken for overloading of a passenger ship.Should he so wish, I will have my officials contact the Deputy directly and they can explain the detail of the certification and enforcement regime and provide clarifications and further detail as required.

The survey shows that in Ireland the deaths per billion vehicle-kilometres for 2006 at 2.39 was better than the EU average, which was 4 deaths per billion vehicle-kilometres.This is, of course, a welcome finding although we must continue our efforts to reduce fatalities on our roads to as low a level as possible.The report itself sounds a note of caution relating to trends drawn from fatalities on motorway in countries such as Ireland where the annual number of such fatalities is below 20.  The report points out that in countries with such low motorway death rates, the number of fatalities from one year to the next year is subject to substantial random fluctuation.It is a core objective of the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 to reduce the level of fatalities on our roads to no more than 60 fatalities per million, which is 252 fatalities per annum or 21 per month.

The obligations of persons on the occurrence of an accident involving a vehicle where injury is caused to person or property are set out in section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. These outline requirements to keep a vehicle at the scene and in relation to the reporting of the accident. There are no proposals under consideration to amend the present provisions.The carrying out of investigations in relation to a collision that has occurred is a matter for the Garda Síochána. Operational procedures for investigations are not prescribed in section 106 so any decision to close off a public road or part of a public road at the scene while investigations are undertaken or the setting up of detour routes for traffic are operational matters for the Gardaí in each situation.On a non-statutory basis, however, I have asked my officials to consult with the Gardaí, the NRA, the City and County Managers Association and the Road Safety Authority to see whether there are any measures which could be taken from a traffic management point of view to mitigate the effects on traffic of collisions or other accidents or incidents which occur on our roads network, particularly in urban areas.

Transport 21 provides for completion of the Interconnector by 2015.I understand from Iarnród Éireann that it has completed the preliminary design of the project, including public consultation in July 2007 on route options and is now proceeding to detailed design and the preparation of an application for a Railway Order. The company aims to submit the application to An Bord Pleanála in 2009 with a view to the commencement of work in 2010, subject to an enforceable Railway Order.With regard to costs, in the interest of the taxpayer and in ensuring that Transport 21 is achieved within budget, it is Government policy that the cost of individual projects should not be released until the public procurement processes have been completed.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	452	As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21. The detailed planning, design and implementation of national road projects, including the possible provision of service and/or rest areas on or near these routes, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Roads Act 2007, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities concerned.In recognition of the important role service area facilities can play in improving the safety of the national road network, my predecessor asked the NRA in late 2005 to review their service area policy.  Arising from this review, the NRA announced a strategy to provide service areas at intervals (where feasible and practicable) of approximately 50-60kms along national routes.   They identified optimum locations for up to 12 service areas on the Major Inter-urban Routes (M1, M4/N4, N6, M7/N7, N8, N9) as well as the N6/N18 and N11 routes.I understand from the NRA that these service areas will offer a full range of services including retail services as well as extensive car and HGV parking facilities.The NRA had initially considered developing service and rest areas separately.  However, having considered the matter further in consultation with local authorities, they have decided that service areas with extensive parking facilities available for both cars and HGVs offer a more attractive product and a more secure environment for all drivers.  In addition, they will allow a more comprehensive enforcement of transport law and regulation.My role is to ensure that the necessary legislative framework is in place to provide for such areas.  I am pleased to inform the House that last Thursday, 28 February 2008, I signed the necessary regulations giving effect to provisions in the Road Act 2007 to facilitate service areas along national routes.   As a result, the NRA expects this week to submit Service Area Schemes to An Bord Pleanála for the first tranche of three services areas on currently constructed sections of the motorway (two on the M1 and one on the M4).The NRA has already begun the PPP procurement processes for these service areas. They are also actively pursing site acquisition for other proposed areas on the rest of the national road network. Subject to An Bord Pleanála approval, completion of the first three service areas is anticipated in 2009.

Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 prohibits the driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle by a person while under the influence of an intoxicant. Enforcement of the law on drink and drug driving is a matter for An Garda Síochána. When a member of the Gardaí suspects that a driver of a vehicle is driving under the influence of any intoxicant, the Garda may arrest the suspect under Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.In addition to this, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann are considering the introduction of drink and drug testing as envisaged in Section 13(1) of the Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.The position applying to shipping transport has two perspectives. Internationally trading ships are required to comply with the International Maritime Organisation's ISM (International Safety Management) Code. This requires the company to identify all hazards and to manage the associated risks. Consequently most shipping companies do assess risks and may develop company specific drug and alcohol policies.Domestic passenger ships proceeding to sea, and cargo ships in excess of 500 gross tonnage, will be required to have an ISM system in place from the 24th March 2008. They will need to assess the necessity for drug and alcohol policies as part of this obligation.In addition the Merchant Shipping (Medical Examinations) Regulations 2005 requires seafarers, employed or engaged in any capacity on board every seagoing ship, whether publicly or privately owned, to hold a valid certificate attesting to their medical fitness for the work for which they are employed. The medical fitness standards applying in Ireland include addiction disorders. Doctors may require a drug and alcohol test at the time of certification of a seafarer.With regard to aviation, Irish, European, and International requirements and regulations require an air operator to establish policies and procedures with regard to the consumption of alcohol and psychoactive substances. These policies and procedures are published in air operators' Operations Manuals, with which all air crew are obliged to comply, and the air operator is required to monitor compliance with these policies and procedures.Specifically, Irish Aviation Authority (Operations) Order, S.I. No. 61 of 2006 and Irish Aviation Authority (Personnel Licensing) Order, S.I. No. 333 of 2000 and subsequent amendment Orders, available on the IAA website www.iaa.ie address these matters.

These include publication of a revised Rules of the Road, road safety awareness events, integration of RSA enforcement activity with An Garda Síochána, Customs and the HSA, and publication of various consultation documents including one on compulsory training for motor cyclists.It is of course the case that work has already begun on other actions in the Strategy which have a longer timeframe for completion, for example the introduction of a lower blood alcohol level for drivers, which is currently being examined by the Road Safety Authority with a view to making a recommendation to me in the next month or so.In relation to penalty points, the position is that while fixed charges can be changed by way of amending Regulations, any increase in the number of penalty points applying to specific offences requires primary legislation.  It is my intention to introduce a new Road Safety Bill later this year, and the issue of penalty points and the recommendations of the RSA on the matter will be considered in that context.The new Road Safety Bill will also include provisions relating to a reduced blood alcohol level and to mandatory alcohol testing of drivers at collisions.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I propose to take Questions Nos.19, 21, 45, 49 and 68 together.It is my intention that the Irish Coast Guard and Maritime Administration will be strengthened to meet the needs of this country well in the 21st century.I have confirmed that investment in a new Integrated Communications System equipment should proceed as quickly as possible.  There has been some delay in recent years in proceeding with this upgrade due to uncertainty about the number and nature of Centres to be provided for and where they should be located. The development of the Centres is being considered in the context of not only replacing the existing hardware but, if possible, an overall upgrade of the Centre's building, offices, meeting room, ergonomics, telecommunications systems and facilities for staff. What is envisaged is a modern, efficient and flexible national coordination centre in line with best international standards.The issue of the number of centres was raised in a 2002 Deloitte and Touche Irish Coast Guard Study. This report has provided a backdrop to ongoing improvements and developments in the Coast Guard over the last 6 years.    A number of recommendations are strategic in nature; including reducing the number of rescue co-ordination centres from the current three to two enhanced Centres. The most economical option identified by the consultants was one Coordination Centre to run the entire country, with a reserve centre nearby, which could be quickly activated if the main centre was out of commission and would also double as a training facility. However the need for strengthened resilience in the event of a severe localised incident, which could make the one Centre and its close by reserve centre inoperable, has led to the focus on a two-centre operation. The consultants did not identify where the two centres should be located.In relation to the west coast I consider that the site should provide a technically robust location, well served by transport and technical and social infrastructure and also be situated where all staff can live within close proximity to enable them to be called on in an emergency. I have not finalised where that location should be but expect to be in a position to do so shortly.  The review of locations is currently underway and the possibilities have narrowed to a choice between a site in the Limerick/Shannon area or Malin or Valentia.Should the decision be to move from Malin or Valentia the possibility of keeping existing staff running combined radio watches from their existing stations is also under evaluation in order to fully utilise the professional knowledge of current staff whilst not asking them to move.In relation to the East Coast, at least 37 posts are to move to the Drogheda area. Should the restructuring I envisage take place it is possible that an increased number could relocate over time.Deputies will understand that the Coast Guard restructuring that is being worked on is aimed at improving the overall quality and efficiency of a key public service.  The proposals will be considered in the context of the many comments I have received and also taking account of the Tánaiste's Budget Day request to each Department to undertake an efficiency review of expenditure.  I have also met Government and Opposition representatives, members of local communities, including the Inishowen Development Partnership Group, to discuss the issue.All the views that have been expressed will be taken into account before final decisions are taken.

As part of my announcement, I made it clear that I see congestion charging as part of a package of traffic management measures to support and complement the major capital investment in public transport that is taking place under Transport 21. Transport 21 is addressing significant investment needs in both roads and public transport and will put in place a modern integrated transport network. When completed it will give car users real choice in their modes of transport. I consider that congestion charging becomes an appropriate policy option only when real choice is available to car users who might be subject to some form of road charging.

Accordingly, at this stage, it would be premature for me to set targets or make decisions, in the context of sustainable travel and transport, on issues such as modal shift, vehicle specification or revisions to speed limits.  The outcome of the consultation exercise will ultimately determine whether or not legislation will be required for the implementation of the sustainable travel and transport action plan.In relation to congestion charging in Dublin, I have no ideological problem with such a proposal.  However, I consider that adequate alternative transportation options, including measures envisaged under Transport 21, must be available to commuters before such charging could be viewed as feasible.

Since its establishment the MCIB has published 74 reports, which contain approximately 300 recommendations.   These recommendations have made a significant contribution to the development of a range of maritime safety measures.The measures cover safety at sea for all those who venture on to the water, most particularly for those seafarers and others who earn their living from domestic waters, whether by coastal trade or fishing or when engaging in various leisure activities.  In relation to fishing vessels a safety regime was put in place for all fishing vessels over 24 metres in length by the introduction, in August 2002, of the Fishing Vessel (Safety Provisions) Regulations 2002.   A Safety Code of Practice was introduced in 2004 for fishing vessels less than 15 metres in length.   The Merchant Shipping (Fishing Vessel) (15-24 metres) Regulations came into effect for new vessels on 1 October 2007.  This represents a phased approach aimed at improving safety measures across all categories of fishing vessels.For the leisure sector new measures have centred on lifejackets, licensing requirements, enforcement and increased safety awareness.  New regulations in relation to the wearing of lifejackets were introduced in June 2004.  The Regulations contain national requirements governing all types of pleasure craft relating to the carrying and wearing of lifejackets, age restrictions on the operation of pleasure craft including personal watercraft and controls on the use of alcohol and drugs while operating such craft.It is now compulsory for all children up to the age of 16 years to wear a life jacket/personal flotation device (PFD) while on board a pleasure craft and for everyone on board small pleasure craft, under 7 metres, to wear a lifejacket/PFD.  All passenger boats are required to have a licence with effect from 1st January 2003 and passenger boat manning regulations came into force from 1st April 2006.  The latter regulations introduced competency requirements for masters of passenger boats.  There has been a crackdown on non-compliance by passenger boat safety involving a campaign of random spot checks over the last number of summers.  Closer liaison with the Garda Síochána and an active policy of prosecution for offenders is also being pursued.A safety awareness campaign was launched as part of an ongoing programme being promoted by the Irish Coast Guard and Maritime Administration.  The campaign involves amongst other things, a series of radio and on-line safety awareness advertisements and intensified targeted publicity campaigns over the summer months.  Where measures have not yet been implemented they continue provide an input into the ongoing development of the maritime safety agenda.

It is responsible for the provision of air traffic management, engineering and related air traffic technological infrastructure in Irish controlled airspace; for communications and associated technological infrastructure on the North Atlantic; and for safety regulation of Ireland's Civil Aviation Industry.I have no function in relation to the deployment and working arrangements of air traffic controllers, which are operational matters for the IAA.  The IAA is self-financing and does not receive any State funding, therefore the question of providing additional funding for training air traffic control personnel does not arise.As regards the safety of the air traffic control system overall, it should be noted that, uniquely in Europe, the IAA is subject to a safety audit carried out by an independent entity, appointed by the Minister pursuant to Section 32 of the Irish Aviation Act 1993, to ensure that the IAA continues to maintain the highest possible safety standards. The next such audit is scheduled to take place this year. The effectiveness of the safety arrangements has been consistently confirmed in the audits carried out and I am satisfied that the IAA operates to a safety standard that ranks among industry leaders.

The precise level to which the BAC will be lowered will follow consideration by me of the advice of the Road Safety Authority (RSA).   I expect to receive that advice in the next month or so.  A number of issues will inform the recommendations of the RSA, including known driver behaviour, past offending rates, analysis of data held by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, enforcement practicalities and best international practice.

I will now consult with Government colleagues on the changes that have been made and very shortly thereafter I will seek Government approval for the Dublin Transport Authority Bill. I will publish the Bill as this process is complete.Solicitors Matheson Ormsby Prentice were engaged on two separate occasions during 2006 to provide legal advice on company and EU law issues that arose during the preparation of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill. The total cost of both consultancies was €39,880 (including VAT).

However, the MBRS is keeping abreast of developments in this area and is keeping me informed on the matter.

Inappropriate speeding has been identified as one of the primary causes of death and injuries on Irish roads.  The introduction of the Safety Camera Network to provide 6,000 hours of enforcement per month is a specific action identified in the 2007 — 2012 Road Safety Strategy.This has been targeted as a very significant addition to the existing enforcement programme and of vital importance not only in achieving increased levels of compliance with road traffic law but also in saving lives.  The Government decision last week to proceed with the safety camera project, notwithstanding the significantly increased costs since the original estimate, is an indication of the Government's seriousness in addressing road safety.

The realisation of any fines or penalties imposed by the Courts is a matter for the Courts Service.The enforcement on foreign registered drivers of penalties for road traffic offences is a complex legal and administrative matter for many States, and my Department is pursuing this question at European, British/Irish and North/South levels.We are working with the United Kingdom with the objective of having a bilateral agreement on mutual recognition of driving disqualifications in place later this year, under the framework of the relevant EU Convention.The mutual recognition of penalty points is however a much more difficult matter which is not covered by the EU Convention.   In particular it involves complex legal questions which have yet to be determined and which will require the passage of primary legislation both here and in the United Kingdom in due course.  While both jurisdictions are working on this, it will be some time before a bilateral agreement can be put in place on this particular issue.

At this stage it is too early to be precise on the detail of the proposals except to confirm that any new licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU Regulation on Public Service Obligations in the transport sector, which was adopted in 2007 and will come into force in December 2009.Work is at an early stage on the drafting of a Road Traffic Bill 2008. It is hoped to bring proposals to Government in the summer. The Bill will deal with a number of road safety issues including a reduction in the blood alcohol level.

While there is some evidence that the level of emissions from ships is greater than previously estimated it remains well below those of other transport modes.Annex VI to the International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) was adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 1997 to control emissions with a view to preventing air pollution from ships.Annex VI which has applied internationally since 2005 is currently under review at IMO with a view to further reducing emissions from ships. The organisation to which the Deputy refers has contributed to the review process by means of a detailed submission. My Department is fully engaged in the review process both at EU level and at IMO and fully supports many of the points made in the submission. This matter is to be next discussed at IMO during the week commencing 31 March 2008.Should a proposal be made to include shipping as part of the reformed EU Trading Scheme I would welcome discussion to enable an informed discussion to be made in due course.

These vessels were not tasked by the Irish Coast Guard but joined the search voluntarily.  The Department of Transport made no commitment to compensate boat owners for the fuel expended during the course of the search.  As a general rule vessels at sea are under an obligation to respond to a distress call at sea. The Department of Transport does not normally compensate vessels or craft of opportunity for the fuel that they have used nor is it international practice to do so.

Apart from being successfully issued with a certificate there are a number of other possible outcomes from such discussions including changing the initial class of passenger ship for which an application was made. In some cases a passenger ship may be issued with a restricted certificate. In others a passenger ship may be changed to a passenger boat and in other cases an applicant may decide not to proceed with the process.  The reasons for these changes are related to safety and environmental protection considerations only. However, as the applicant always has the option to re-apply for a certificate following any work carried out on their vessel the concept of out-right refusal, as such, does not exist.It is not a straightforward matter to provide the answer to this part of the enquiry.

As the Deputy is aware, the implementation of individual national road projects and the allocation of funding in relation to the construction or maintenance of such projects are matters for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.

I have no role in relation to the disposal of property by CIÉ.Transport 21 does not provide funding for the redevelopment of Ceannt or other stations having regard to the scale and extent of other priority demands for funding, and the potential available to CIÉ to fund station developments from its own resources. Transport 21 does, however, provide funding for accessibility works at existing stations.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The recommendations referred to by the Deputy are contained in a report published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) on 28th May 2007.   The report relates to the tragic capsizing and sinking of the fishing vessel the "Rising Sun" in fishing grounds off the Co. Wexford coast on 29th November 2005, with the loss of two lives.I would at the outset like to convey again my sympathies to the families on their tragic losses.The Department has examined the MCIB recommendations with a view to addressing any shortcomings in either the statutory basis of the regimes covering fishing vessels or in relation to enforcement arrangements.With regard to Recommendation 8.2 referred to by the Deputy surveys of fishing vessels that are less than 15 metres long are carried out on behalf of the Department of Transport by an approved panel of surveyors.   The Department updated and renewed this panel in 2007, during which the Department interviewed applicant surveyors.As part of the interview process applicants were required to show an understanding of the importance of informing the fishing vessel owners of the necessity to immediately notify the surveying authority of any alterations in equipment or structure or the intended use of their vessel.Recommendation 8.3 makes reference to the Declaration of Compliance, recommending that this should include a report of the type of fishing equipment fitted at the time of the survey of the vessel and the intended purpose of the vessel.  The Declaration of Compliance is contained in an annex to the Code of Practice in respect of fishing vessels less than 15 metres.The Department published the Code of Practise for the design, construction and equipment of small fishing vessels in 2004.  This Code sets minimum standards of safety for the vessel to protect all persons on board.   It covers vessel design, construction, machinery, safety equipment and stability issues.In 2007 the emphasis was on bringing in safety regulations covering 15-24 metre vessels where previously there had been no regulatory regime.   However, now that that has been done the Code for under 15 metre vessels is being reviewed when both recommendations 8.2 and 8.3 will be fully covered in any amendments or improvements to the Declaration of Compliance.In relation to fishing vessel safety generally it is important to emphasise that the Department has implemented a comprehensive regulatory framework for fishing vessels to ensure a higher level of safety over time.  This is being achieved over time through an approach that separates the fleet into three categories. The first is less than 15 metres in length, and would include the Rising Sun, where a non-statutory Code of Practice is in operation, the other two are 15 to 24 metres and over 24 metres and in both cases there is now a statutory regime in place.As I have indicated previously, fishing vessel safety must rely not only on the introduction of regulations but on compliance with them. This in turn may require not only specific training but also an increasingly rigorous enforcement regime.

I have accepted an offer of support from the Irish Insurance Federation and its constituent members to have the necessary data made available voluntarily and this approach is now being progressed.Establishment of a framework going forward so that there is an effective system in place which ensures that all write off instances are notified and properly recorded is also an important constituent of an overall solution. Further consultation with relevant stakeholders is required in this respect.

This discretion is provided in acknowledgement of the fact that urgent medical attention for seriously injured victims must take precedence over breath testing.The Attorney General has now advised on possible amendments to legislation, which continue to take overriding medical circumstances into account.  This issue will be included in the next Road Traffic Bill, which I hope to bring to Government later this year.

In accordance with the legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for licences to operate scheduled bus passenger services within the State.Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann are not subject to licensing in accordance with the provisions of the 1932 Road Transport Act, as amended.  However, the initiation or alteration of a bus service by either Company is subject to compliance with the necessary regulatory requirement of giving advance notice to my Department and to compliance with the provisions of Section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 concerning competition with licensed private operators.

A county council or a city council can intervene through the making of special speed limit bye-laws to apply a higher or lower speed limit value in lieu of the default speed limit.When a new national road by-pass or motorway road opens, the former national road that is now by-passed automatically reverts to the status of local road and the default speed limit of 80km/h applies. No order is required to remove the former national road (‘N' route) status or to apply local road status.If the road authority wishes to have that local road classified as a regional road (and assigned an ‘R' route number) they must submit a proposal to my Department seeking to have that route re-classified through the making of a regional road classification order.A single default speed limit of 80km/h applies to regional & local roads so classification as a regional road from being a local road does not affect the default speed limit.Local authorities have been written to over recent years in relation to the need to ensure that the speed limits that are posted on the public roads have a valid legal basis.

In addition, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 — Transforming Ireland, commits some Euro 90 million to the Programme over its full term.I was delighted to announce recently an additional Euro 2 million for the RTP in 2008, bringing the total allocation for the Programme this year to €11 million. For future years, the specific year-on-year allocations for the RTP will, as is the norm, be determined in the context of the overall annual estimates process each year.I am satisfied that arising from the review of the Rural Transport Initiative in 2006 that a further review of the programme is not warranted at this stage. My role  continues to be one of facilitator, helping local communities to address their transport needs through financial and administrative support, while communities themselves take the lead in identifying their needs and developing co-ordinated transport services to fulfil those needs.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	486	Under the terms of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2408/92 of 23 July 1992, a Member State may, in limited circumstances, impose a Public Service Obligation in respect of an air service and may subvent that service if no airline is prepared to operate it on a commercial basis.My Department had discussions recently with the EU Commission about air connectivity from the West of Ireland and in particular about the possible imposition of a Public Service Obligation (PSO) on the Shannon-Heathrow route.The Commission's position, as clarified following those discussions, is that the EU Regulation governing PSOs is an exception to the general rule of free provision of air services and that any such exception should be considered as restrictively as possible and applied only as far as necessary.  In order for a route to be eligible for a PSO under the Regulation, not only must it be vital for the economic development of the region concerned but the existing services must be inadequate.  In assessing whether services are adequate, account has to be taken of all existing air transport services, direct and indirect.In relation to the Shannon to London route, the Commission has noted that there are already regular direct air services between Shannon and the London airports of  Gatwick, Stansted and Luton.  Allowing for these connections, the Commission has indicated that it would be difficult to justify a PSO on the Shannon to London route.  Accordingly, I do not propose to pursue the question of a Shannon-Heathrow PSO any further.When the question of introducing a PSO service on the Waterford-Dublin route was raised in 1993, I understand that the E.U. Commission refused to sanction the proposal because the route is relatively short and because Waterford was already adequately served by other transport modes.  In the interim, the relevant surface transport links have been upgraded and continue to be improved.  In the circumstances, I have no proposals to revive the question of including the airport in the Irish PSO air service programme.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.The position is that while the carers allowance, payable by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, is disregarded in determining the total income of the home carer for the purposes of claiming the home carer tax credit, it is a taxable source of income.Taking account of the most up to date information available to them, the Revenue Commissioners have determined that it would appear to be more beneficial for the couple to be taxed as a married two-earner couple rather than a married one-earner couple.  As a result, the home carer credit has been withdrawn for 2008 and the standard rate band for the couple increased from €44,400 to €70,800 with transferability limited to €44,400.  This increase in the value of the standard rate band will be more than sufficient to offset the loss of the home carer credit in the calculation of the couple's tax liability.  Given the information available, this will ensure that the couple will not be liable to tax at the higher rate in 2008.However, the Limerick Revenue Office will contact the taxpayer to ascertain if any further information is available and will revise the position if necessary, ensuring that the couple  receive the most beneficial tax treatment appropriate to their situation.

In this regard, I would point out that the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service depends on the nature of the good or service and not on the status of the consumer.  In this case, there is no provision in EU law that would permit the removal or reduction of VAT based on the social or economic status of the consumer.In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use.  The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.

This must be done in a framework which takes account of the overall business and ICT strategy for the organisation.  The Circular 16/97 delegated sanctioning process is streamlined in respect of those organisations which have, inter alia, agreed ICT Plans and established ICT priorities.  In the event that these are not in place, a more rigorous assessment of proposals that necessitates increased contact between my Department and the sponsoring organisation is required.There have been no delays in my Department with regard to the sanctioning of ICT-related expenditure by the HSE as a result of the procedures put in place under the terms of Department of Finance Circular 16/97.  This delegation process is continually monitored in order to ensure that it meets the continuing needs of all organisations, and there are no current plans to further review the sanctioning process.

This brought the total funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives to €8 million and this level of funding continues into 2008.It should also be emphasised that a  range of services such as mental health and primary care services are important in helping to prevent suicide. These services play a vital role in the drive to reduce the incidence of suicide, and should be taken into account when considering the level of expenditure devoted to suicide prevention.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	506	"A Vision for Change" the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, which was launched in January 2006, has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.  The vision embodied in this policy is to create a mental health system that addresses the needs of the population through a focus on the requirements of the individual.The Report recommends inter alia that a plan to bring about the closure of all mental hospitals should be drawn up and implemented, and that the resources released by these closures should be protected for reinvestment in the mental health service.  "A Vision for Change" is very clear that resources, both capital and revenue, should be retained in the mental health service, with the reconfigured mental health services having priority in their disposal.  It also recommends that the full economic value of psychiatric hospital buildings and lands should be professionally assessed towards identifying appropriate future use and maximum value and benefit.  The value of these assets significantly counter balances the capital cost of the new mental health services infrastructure requirement.The Health Service Executive (HSE) has primary responsibility for the implementation of "A Vision for Change".  The Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney has made it clear to the HSE, in the context of their Service Plan for 2008, that there can be no question of diverting capital or development funds to meet expenditure pressures arising in relation to core services.

Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and have a reply issued directly to the Deputy in relation to the number of community midwives working under the home births scheme in Cork, the date of establishment of the scheme and plans for its continuance.I am aware of concerns in relation to indemnity insurance for independent midwives. The Irish Nurses Organisation provides a certain level of insurance cover to independent midwives who are members of the organisation. The INO had indicated that they would not be providing insurance cover after 31st March, however, I understand that it has been in touch with its insurer about extending this cover until the end of September.I support choice for women in childbirth. The option of domiciliary births must only be provided in a safe and secure manner. My officials are working with the HSE to put in place a robust national clinical governance framework in order to ensure that the practice of independent midwives is brought into close working relationships with maternity services currently delivered by the HSE and the voluntary maternity hospitals. Subject to this being achieved it would then be the intention to bring the independent midwives within the scope of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme by means of an extension of the cover under the scheme to the HSE.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the number of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its annual National Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued to the Deputy.

As a Statutory body, the provision of these services, including the delivery of services by agreement with voluntary and community organisations such as the Irish Osteoporosis Society, is a matter for the Executive.I am satisfied that the HSE recognises the valuable work undertaken by the Irish Osteoporosis Society and makes every effort to assist them in line with resources available.  This is reflected in a practical way in the funding given to the IOS by the Executive in recent years.  The question of any revised funding arrangements would be a matter, in the first instance, for the Executive in the light of its overall competing demands and through any new agreement with the Society on future service provision.In the circumstances, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.  The  Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

As the Deputy is aware, the implementation of individual national road projects and the allocation of funding in relation to the construction or maintenance of such projects are matters for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.The construction of the Dublin Port Tunnel project was procured by Dublin City Council and funded through the NRA. I understand from the NRA that the estimated final outturn cost of the Tunnel remains at €751 million.The two-fold purpose of the Port Tunnel and the HGV Management Strategy which goes with it are to improve the flow of goods to and from Dublin Port, and to remove heavy goods vehicles from the streets of the city.  To date, the operation of both the tunnel and the strategy have made good progress in terms of both of these objectives.The Dublin Port Tunnel was closed on Wednesday 27th February for approximately nine hours because of an electronic equipment failure.  This is the latest in a sequence of electronic equipment failures to cause a temporary closure of the Tunnel.The NRA and Dublin City Council have repeatedly taken up the issue of electronic equipment failure with the contractors.Arising from last Wednesday's incident, I have urged both organisations to intensify their efforts to remedy the equipment failures and indeed any other causes for occasional tunnel closures.The responsibility for the design, installation and provision of the various tunnel systems was that of Nishimatsu-Mowlem-Irishenco (NMI) under the terms of their contract to Dublin City Council.  During the delivery of the project, both the NRA and Dublin City Council were repeatedly reassured and guaranteed that the tunnel systems would be fully fit for their intended purpose and that the installed equipment would be both durable and resilient.  Since the handover of the tunnel just over one year ago there have been a number of individual equipment malfunctions such that this is clearly not the case in all circumstances.The issue, therefore is with the durability and reliability of the equipment provided by the contractorThe contractors have been put on notice of legal action to recover all costs arising from deficiencies in the equipment provided.  In addition further legal action will be pursued for any further failure on the part of the contractor to urgently carry out all necessary works and equipment replacements to deliver the full tunnel systems to the standard required and contracted for.  Where the contractor does not immediately deal with any deficiency in systems or equipment the NRA will do so itself and pursue recovery of the costs from the contractor, so that costs will lie where they contractually should.

The Government is committed to seeing the further expansion and enhancement of public bus services and wants to see a world class service delivered to all citizens.Moreover, the Government is wholeheartedly committed to getting best value for the travelling public and the taxpayer from significant subsidies being invested by the Exchequer in public bus services operated by Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann.In order to achieve this, the Government has identified in the Programme for Government a number of priorities.Firstly, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to expedite the establishment of a Dublin Transport Authority, which will have the necessary powers to ensure the delivery of the integrated public transport system envisioned under Transport 21.It is my intention to bring the Dublin Transport Authority Bill to Cabinet shortly for approval and approval to publish.In terms of the subvented bus market, the DTA Bill will set out the mechanisms for the award of contracts for this subvention in line with the new regime introduced under the new EU PSO Regulation, which will become mandatory from next year.  These mechanisms will support the continued operation of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann services in the GDA and provide for the option of new services being provided on foot of open tendering which will allow private operators to compete for the delivery of services.The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to improving bus services under 'Transport 21' by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private.It is my intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals.  Any new licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU Regulation on Public Service Obligations in the transport sector, which was adopted in 2007 and will come into force next year.While it is not possible at this time to indicate a precise time as to when the legislative proposals on regulatory reform of the bus market will be published, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, and the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.

Kildare is based on the DTO strategy for rail-based park and ride, adopted by my Department in 2005.  The strategy recommends new or expanded parking facilities at 22 locations on the existing and planned rail network in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  Two of these sites are on the Maynooth line, and three on the Kildare line.Following adoption of the DTO strategy, my Department made funding of €5 million available to local authorities in the GDA in 2006 for the development of park and ride facilities, followed by €1 million in each of 2007 and 2008.  It is a matter for the local authorities to develop proposals and apply to my Department for funding.  My Department has recently been in touch with the City and County Managers Association about accelerating the bringing forward of proposals for expenditure.Iarnród Éireann provides car-parking facilities at its stations in County Kildare, and my Department has asked the company to forward details of current and planned car-parking capacity to the Deputy.My Department has allocated over 2006 and 2007 €15,015,000 in Exchequer funding to Iarnród Éireann towards the cost of upgraded and enlarged car parking facilities at train stations throughout the country — €10,915,000 approved in 2006 and €4,100,000 approved in 2007.  This funding included €1.2 million for Leixlip Louisa Bridge station car park, €1.4 million for Newbridge station car park, and €95,000 to link Sallins Station with a new car park.In addition, feasibility studies for the upgrade of car parks at Kildare, Kilcock and Athy were funded as part of a countrywide programme of feasibility studies.

While the majority of projects will be delivered ahead of or in accordance with the indicative timetable published at the launch of Transport 21, the huge scale of the programme is such that adjustments to the timescale for individual projects is inevitable.  The value of the ten-year financial framework is that it gives us the flexibility to deal with this in an effective way. The necessary revisions to completion dates have arisen for a range of reasons including changes to the scope of projects arising from public consultation, planning issues, procurement issues and archaeological difficulties.The overall budget for Transport 21 is €34 billion and I am satisfied that the projects identified will be delivered within this budget.

They inform both our bilateral work in Programme Countries and our support for and dialogue with multilateral development bodies.Irish Aid's focus on reducing poverty and supporting the provision of basic services to the poorest people is wholly consistent with the attainment of the MDGs.  By delivering on the commitment to reach the 0.7% UN target for development funding by 2012, Ireland is also perceived as being at the forefront of international efforts to reach the Goals.We continue to focus over 80% of our bilateral country assistance on sub-Saharan Africa where needs are greatest.  The overarching objectives of the aid programme are poverty reduction and sustainable development.  We address fundamental human needs such as food security, basic education, primary health care and safe water supplies, areas which are essential to achieving the MDGs.  Irish Aid works closely with partner Governments and civil society in our Programme Countries to monitor progress in relation to the MDGs.In addition to an overall target for poverty reduction, we work with other donors and partner Governments in sectors such as health and education to identify clear targets to be achieved.  These targets, for instance, include the number of schools built, the number of girls in education and so forth.  In such cases, a joint review is held annually and, where problems are identified, measures to address these are included in the following year's annual planning process.The United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, has assigned the task of monitoring implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  The latest MDG progress report, issued in July 2007, gave us a snapshot of the progress achieved as we head towards the 2015 MDG target date, broken down by Goal and by region.Overall, there has been good progress on some targets, with more intensive effort required on others.  The indications are that, if current trends continue, we are on target to reach the MDG on poverty reduction for the world as a whole, while progress has also been made globally in relation to reducing child mortality and increasing school enrolment rates.However sub-Saharan Africa unfortunately continues to lag behind other parts of the world.  We are therefore very supportive of efforts to strengthen Africa's efforts to meet the Goals such as the MDG Africa Steering Group convened by the Secretary General last September.  The Taoiseach has also indicated his support for a meeting at Heads of Government level in September 2008, with the aim of intensifying MDG efforts in the period leading up to 2015.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	543	Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills.In November 2004, to cater for older workers in particular, I revised the 3 year CE participation limit to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE.  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment (including those under 55 years) was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments.  In general, the Part-time Integration Option is for people of 25 or over who are receiving social welfare payments for 1 year or more, and people of 18 years or over in receipt of disability-related payments.  The Part-time Job Option is for people who are 35 or over and in receipt of social welfare payments for 3 years or longer.Certain groups such as travellers and refugees aged 18 or over are eligible for both options. If you qualify under the criteria but do not wish to take up the option yourself, there are certain conditions under which you can do a spousal swap.In line with Government policy, participation on employment schemes for all participants has an upper age limit of 65 years of age i.e. FÁS may provide funds to community based employers to cover participant costs until the day before their 66th birthday.Any individual, including widows over 55, can participate on CE up to their 66th birthday provided they have not reached their participation limit in terms of years spent on the programme.The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.

I am satisfied that each Agency has in place systems to allow it respond expeditiously and comprehensively to enquiries from Oireachtas Members and should the Deputy have concerns regarding the speed with which any of these Bodies deals with enquiries from Oireachtas Members, or the quality of their responses, I will be happy to bring them to the attention of the Agency's CEO for appropriate action.  In this regard, Agency CEOs are generally available to appear before Oireachtas Committees to account for the running of their Agencies.Additionally, there are three other Bodies which exercise certain statutory functions under legislation for which I am the responsible Minister and these are:1. The Company Law Review Group (CLRG),2. The Patents Agents Board, and3. The Trade Mark Agents Board.As the CLRG was established under the Companies Acts, I am answerable to the Oireachtas for its work, however, given the specialist nature of the work of the other two Bodies, enquiries from Oireachtas Members do not generally arise.Finally, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA), which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Finance, has been appointed as the "competent authority" to authorise collective investment funds and to supervise the activities of fund managers to ensure they comply with the requirements contained in relevant legislation.

In line, however, with my remit to create an environment, which enables culture to flourish, I commenced a scheme last year to support designated County museums and museums within the Museums Standards Programme administered by the Heritage Council of Ireland.  The objectives of the scheme are to assist in the enhancement of the exhibition experience; encourage the use of local and regional museums by a larger segment of society; and promote museums as a focal point in the community for social purposes.  Grants totalling over €101,000 were paid in 2007 under that scheme.It is the intention to run a similar scheme this year and funding of €125,000 is available.

There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.  The South-Eastern Area of the Executive has advised that the person concerned applied to the local Community Welfare Office (CWO) for an ENP for clothing in November 2007.  The CWO has advised that the person concerned had already received a number of exceptional needs payments in 2007 and her request was refused as an exceptional need was not in evidence.  The person concerned appealed the decision to the designated officer of the HSE Appeals Office in December 2007 and the decision was upheld on appeal.  The person concerned has been notified of the decision.  The person concerned was further advised that if there are changes in her circumstances she should make a formal application for an ENP that will be considered under the terms of the scheme.

Her circumstances were investigated by a Social Welfare Inspector who reported that, in her view, the person concerned had not established that she is a separated person within the meaning of the Social Welfare legislation and that there is evidence of an ongoing relationship with her husband.  On the basis of the Inspector's report, the Deciding Officer disallowed her application to One Parent Family Payment.The person concerned appealed the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Following an oral hearing on 20 September 2006 the Appeals Officer disallowed her appeal on the grounds that she had not shown that the marriage tie had been broken and he considered the separation to be geographic in nature.  On 17 April 2007 the person concerned again applied for One Parent Family Payment.  Her application was investigated by a Social Welfare Inspector who reported that her circumstances were basically unchanged from the previous investigation.  On the basis of a further Inspector's report the Deciding Officer disallowed her application to One Parent Family Payment.  The person concerned appealed the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Following an oral hearing on 8 January 2008 the Appeals Officer, having considered all the appellant's evidence including that adduced at the oral hearing, concluded that he was not satisfied that the appellant had established that she is a separated person within the meaning of the legislation.  The appeal was disallowed.  An Appeal Officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts and fresh evidence.

My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.In the interim, all foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933 to 2005 rest with my Department.  My Department will carry forward responsibility for all other foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933, including in respect of all aquaculture developments and piers and harbours, other than in respect of port companies and harbour authorities governed by the Harbours Acts 1946, 1996 and 2000 and any other harbour or harbour related developments intended for commercial trade.  Under the existing interim foreshore management procedures, the construction of an offshore electricity generating station on the foreshore is governed by the Foreshore Act 1933.  Applications for offshore electricity generating stations are subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment and the views are sought from in excess of 100 consultees, both statutory and non-statutory.  Applications are subject to a two-month public consultation phase, advertised both locally and nationally.The application is assessed within the Department and by the Marine Licence Vetting Committee, which comprise a number of professionals, suitably qualified to assess the application.  When it has been determined that all the issues in the consultation process have been properly addressed, the application is sent to the Minister for a decision as to whether the lease should be granted.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will clearly assume the critical role in relation to future aspects of foreshore management for offshore wind facilities.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of progressing the various elements required to develop the appropriate coastal zone legislative framework.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	557	The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a challenging national issue which faces all sectors of Irish society.  Farmers are playing their part in meeting this challenge and my Department supports their efforts by funding and promoting   various schemes which contribute to the reduction and sequestration of greenhouse gases.  These include the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS), the Organic Farming Scheme and the Scheme of Grant Aid for the Development of the Organic Sector, the Bioenergy Scheme for Willow and Miscanthus and the Afforestation Scheme.REPS rewards farmers for adhering to environmentally sustainable farming practices and contributes significantly to the selective planting of broadleaf tree species and to the planting and rejuvenation of hedgerows.  Other measures in REPS which are expected to have a positive impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are those designed to improve the management of organic manures and to reduce the use of chemical fertilisers.  In terms of reduced fertiliser use and consequent emissions, organic farming too has a role to play.  The forestry sector is very important in addressing climate change, as it removes CO2 from the atmosphere, in addition to being a valuable source of renewable energy, thus replacing fossil fuels.  Over the past twenty years, close to 300,000 hectares of new forestry has been established in Ireland, the majority of this by the private sector.  In recent years over 90% of new planting has been by farmers.  My Department also supports the development of other renewable energy sources through its Bioenergy Scheme.

Many small-scale producers find that combining farming with off-farm employment is an effective way to ensure their continued viability in farming.  At the same time, full-time farmers are looking to the new flexibility offered to them under decoupling to develop and intensify their commercial farm enterprises.  In this regard, the Government is providing considerable funding through the National Development Plan 2007-2013 to encourage increased investment and market driven production.  This Government is focused on ensuring that farming families have the best possible options available for them to stay on the land.  That may mean as full-time farmers, if their farm size and resources are sufficient, and if they choose that option.  Alternatively it may be through the combination of on-farm and off-farm income, which many smaller farmers are finding as the best route to a viable life on the land.  The commitment of this Government is to support and encourage our farm families in whichever option they choose.

While the person named, as joint owner of the entitlements in question, is automatically entitled to fifty percent, the remaining entitlements form part of the estate of his deceased brother.  The person named was asked to forward a copy of the Will of the deceased person, or other testamentary documentation.  The person named was also requested to complete essential elements of the Transfer application form that were incomplete.  In addition, the person named does not hold a herd number in his own right nor has the existing herd number been transferred into the sole name of the person named.  No further communication has been received from the person named in relation to the issues outlined above. It should also be noted that no 2007 Single Payment application was received under this herdnumber for the 2007 scheme year.

Wexford as part of BIM's response to a recommendation in the Seafood Industry Strategy — Steering A New Course 2007-2013 to increase training to the inshore sector in view of the significantly higher rates of accidents and machinery failure on inshore and coastal vessels affecting safety, profitability and crew retention.  This follows the replacement of BIM's two highly successful mobile Coastal Training Units.  The new units have a 16% increased floor area due to a unique expandable pod, considerably expanding their training potential.  They are equipped with the most up-to-date computer, navigation, multimedia training technology, as well as radio and safety demonstration equipment and separate fire demonstration trailers accompanies them.  The new Coastal Training Units are self-contained having their own generators and are designed to host video conferences through satellite Broadband and facilitate contact with training facilities in other BIM training centres and abroad.  The CTU's main customer base is situated in remote fishing coastal communities where they deliver safety and skills training programmes to the industry, visiting on average 30 coastal communities each year.BIM is also installing a new firefighting unit in the National Fisheries College Greencastle, County Donegal this year to deliver three and five day Firefighting courses to fishermen studying for their Department of Transport Certificates of Competency.  This unit will also be availed of by fishermen from Northern Ireland, where similar facilities are not available.  It is worth noting that all fishermen are eligible to undertake BIM training programmes including those serving on vessels that are decommissioning.  In this regard, BIM and FÁS have agreed to co-operate to provide training for fishing vessel crew members that find themselves without a job when their fishing vessel is decommissioned.  Both agencies will work closely together to provide retraining, upskilling or diversification opportunities in the seafood industry or elsewhere in the economy as required.

The Scheme allows Boards of Management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives Boards of Management control of the building project.  The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects.  The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.The school authorities have received planning permission for their project and are at tender stage at present. 70% of the grant will be paid to the school's bank account when the contractor is on site and has commenced construction.  An application for additional funding in respect of the provision of a PE facility has recently been received from the school.  This will be considered by the Department's Review Group shortly.  The school will be informed of the decision in due course.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	568	I have not had discussions with my colleague the Minister for Finance in the matter.  I am anxious however to enable schools to conserve water and keep their bills as low as possible. An information package is currently being prepared for schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. As part of this exercise, technical guidance and specifications for the most common problems that are likely to arise in this area will be provided.Rainwater harvesting systems have real potential to reduce schools future water bills in conjunction with other technologies. The demand for water in schools must be minimised firstly through push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks, etc, then the potential for rainwater harvesting can be maximised by reducing the amount of mains water used to flush toilets. (Typically this would be about two thirds of the water used in a school).In that context my Department has selected Stamullen National School, Co Meath where a new 16 classroom GRD school is under construction to trial a rainwater harvesting system and are reviewing the suitability of other potential locations currently at early construction stage for such systems. While fitting the systems in new schools during construction is relatively straight forward, retrofitting them in existing schools is much more difficult and very expensive because of the various dedicated pipe work systems and the amount of builders work and making good that would be required in each instance.In November 2007 the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley TD, through Dublin City Council, launched a "Conserve Water in Schools" campaign which involved giving all schools in Dublin City a present of a water butt to collect rain water for use in school gardens and free "hippo bags" to put in toilet cisterns that will automatically reduce the amount of water used with each flush. A "Conserve Water in Schools Resource Pack" was launched which shows children how they can get involved in conserving water and put a stop to water wastage in their schools. The school pack shows children how to audit the amount of water used in their school and how to devise a plan of action to reduce water usage and to stop wastage.Action sheets in the pack encourage pupils to keep up their good water conservation habits and show them how to monitor and evaluate their own school's Plan of Action on an ongoing basis. All schools everywhere can get involved by downloading the schools' pack from the council's website, www.dublincity.ie.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	570	On 4th January 2008, details were announced by Government of the transitional arrangements which will apply for schools water services as part of the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive. This statement reiterated the Governments commitment to full implementation of the Directive, which has as its objective the promotion of water conservation and the efficient use of water as an important and scarce natural resource.The legal advice available to the Government is that under the EU Framework Directive all non-domestic users must pay for water used. Schools, like other non-domestic water services users, must pay water charges. This advice also confirms that schools will be required to pay the full cost of water services used on a metered basis with effect from 1st January 2010. The Directive also requires that measures are put in place up to 2010 to move towards full cost recovery.For the transition period the Government agreed that non-fee paying recognised schools will pay a flat rate per pupil fee as follows:— 2007 — €3 per pupil, 2008 — €3.50 per pupil and 2009 — €4 per pupil enrolled. For 2007, charges applied based on metering will be recalculated on the transitional flat rate with a credit given for any excess payment.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will advise local authorities of the detailed arrangements which will be put in place to implement this decision.  These new arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place the necessary water conservation arrangements and practices and undertake necessary works to ensure that when full water charges are introduced in two years time schools will have significantly reduced their water usage and, by virtue of good water conservation, be in a much stronger position to meet their water charges. Those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.An information package is currently being prepared for schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists.  As part of this exercise, technical guidance and specifications for the most common problems that are likely to arise in this area will be provided. In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.

Band 2.2 constitutes a school with a deficit of mainstream accommodation which constitutes a substantial and significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation needs, while the condition of the existing accommodation is adequate.As the Deputy may be aware a Developing Areas Unit was set up in the Department of Education and Science to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas including Midleton.  The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.In this context, the status of the project to which the Deputy refers will be re-assessed and banded according.  The project will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.

Such a report may be of benefit in the event of future applications for funding.As the Deputy may be aware, the Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004. Since then, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of €300 million have been completed. Considerable investment has been provided in the Budget with almost €600 million this year for investment in school building infrastructure. With so many small projects having been completed over the past few years, I am focusing on delivering as many large scale projects as possible in 2008 with an emphasis on providing additional pupil places in developing areas. There is not, therefore, a new Summer Works Scheme as part of our building programme this year.

My Department is committed to the maintenance of a robust psychological service based on international practice.My Department is currently continuing to develop and expand the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and resources allocated to my Department for psychological purposes are being invested for this purpose.  Since May 2007 the number of psychologists employed within the NEPS service has increased from 128 to 138 and during 2008 this complement will increase to 169.In this regard, following a national recruitment process put in place in late 2007 by the Public Appointments Service, interviews are currently being held to form regional panels from which appointments to priority regions. In line with Government commitments under the T2016 agreement, it is further my intention to increase NEPS psychologist personnel to 200 during 2009.

The school will be delivered along with new schools in Phibblestown, Co Dublin and Laytown, Co. Meath under a design and build contract that is aimed at delivering 3,000 school places for these rapidly developing areas. The Department has appointed a Project Manager to oversee the delivery of these projects and the procurement process is well advanced for a Design Team to do the initial design of these 3 new schools.The School Planning Section of my Department has approved temporary accommodation for the school to commence operation in September 2008. Applications for enrolment in the new school is a matter for County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, who are the patron body.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	576	As part of the expansion of the Small Schools Scheme, a grant of €484,000 was sanctioned to enable the management authority of the school in question to extend and modernise their school.The Scheme allows Boards of Management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives Boards of Management control of the building project.The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects. The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding. A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money. The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.The current position is that the school management have applied for planning permission and are awaiting a decision.  They have submitted an application for additional funding which is being considered by the Department's Review Group. The school will be informed of the decision in due course.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	577	I am aware that many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, similar to those referred to by the Deputy, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision.In order to proactively plan for such areas of increased growth, my Department is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment.As a matter of course, meetings are arranged with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and their possible implications for school provision so as to ensure, as far as possible, the timely delivery of the required education infrastructure.The primary schools in Kill, Johnstown and Sallins are in the catchment area of Naas for post-primary purposes. In Naas at post primary level, the management authority of St. Patrick's Post Primary School, Co. Kildare V.E.C., is currently progressing plans to re-locate the school and extend capacity to 1000 pupil places.Additionally, an extension project is completed at St. Mary's College, Naas which increases capacity at the school to 900 pupils. A similar extension was recently completed at Meanscoil Iognaid Rís, Naas and a further extension at the school is currently in architectural planning.

I assure the Deputy that the Government is aware of the need for a new post primary school in Athy and is committed to providing this on a greenfield site. Progression of all projects to tender and construction, including the project in question, will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	581	The New School Advisory Committee (NSAC) has received an application for the recognition of a new primary school for September, 2008 in the location referred to by the Deputy. The NSAC is an independent advisory group established to process applications for the recognition of new primary schools and to make recommendations to the Minister for Education and Science. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the outcome of all applications before the NSAC, including this application, in April.

The site was recently master planned to ascertain if it would be feasible to facilitate both this school and two other all-Irish schools on the site. With the completion of the masterplan, progress on the project can now be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I can confirm that the Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works, which generally acts on behalf of the Department in relation to site acquisitions, was asked to source a site for the school to which the Deputy refers. A report was received from the Office of Public Works which outlined a number of site options and these are still under consideration in my Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	584	The Deputy will be aware that while individual institutions in the education sector have varying degrees of autonomy according to their status and statutory provisions, the Minister has an overarching responsibility for education policy across all levels of the education system and responsibility for funding provided from the Education Vote.My Department and all of the agencies under its remit are fully committed to providing a Quality Customer Service to all of our customers and to continually improving the standard of services provided.  The arrangements in place in the agencies to respond to enquiries from members of Dail Eireann is a matter for the individual agencies.There are a number of agencies that carry out functions or services provided for under statutory instruments:Further Education & Training Awards Council — Qualifications (Education & Training) Act, 1999Higher Education and Training Awards Council — Qualifications (Education & Training) Act, 1999National Qualifications Authority of Ireland — Qualifications (Education & Training) Act, 1999Higher Education Authority — HEA Act 1971 National Council for Curriculum and Assessment — Education Act 1998National Council for Special Education — Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004National Education Welfare Board — Education (Welfare) Act 2000State Examinations Commission — State Examinations Commission (Establishment) Order 2003Grangegorman Development Agency — Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005An Chomhairle um Oideachais Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta — Education Act 1998The Teaching Council — Teaching Council Act 2001Vocational Education Committees — VEC Act 1930
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	585	I would like to assure the Deputy that it is a key priority for the Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools. For that reason specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions in the Programme for Government. These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular. In 2008 alone my Department will be paying around €167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs. The improvements announced in the last budget mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools will increase by €21 to €330 per pupil. As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost €100,000 to meet their running costs.The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €178.58 from 1st January, 2008. This represents an increase of 212% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €457.00 to €880 per pupil — an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.I agree that increases in primary capitation must be a priority and that is why we are committed to doubling it by 2012. This year, despite the overall difficult economic environment I delivered an increase of €15 per pupil on capitation levels in 2008. I want to assure the Deputy that this Government has a track record of significantly increasing funding for schools and we will continue to build on this and deliver on our Programme for Government commitment.

An assessment of projected enrolment trends, demographic trends and housing developments in the area was carried out in order to inform the determination of the long term projected staffing on which the school's accommodation needs will be based. This has been finalised and notified to the school. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered on an on-going basis in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

The site comprises three plots of land with three separate vendors. My Department are continuing to progress any outstanding issues. When the site acquisition is complete, a building project for the school will be considered in the context of my Department's 2008 budget allocation and the School Building and Modernisation Programme.

The basic purpose of Coiste an Asgard is to promote the training of young people over the age of 16 in sailing and seamanship, particularly by the use of the sail-training vessel Asgard II.Apart from Parliamentary Questions (for which special arrangements apply),the number of enquiries from members of Dáil Éireann received by either the Civil Defence Board or Coiste an Asgard is very small. However, any enquiry received is dealt with promptly.

Secondly, mandatory minimum sentences apply where a person is convicted of a second or subsequent offence under section 15A or 15B of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 as amended.  These are the offences of possession or importation of controlled drugs for sale or supply with a value of over of €13,000.  Mandatory minimum sentences also apply to certain firearms offences.Finally, presumptive minimum sentences apply where: a person is convicted of a first offence under section 15A or 15B of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 as amended; a person is convicted on indictment of a second or subsequent offence being a scheduled offence under section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 within a period of 7 years of a previous conviction on indictment for a scheduled offence.In order for the provision to be triggered, the sentence imposed for the previous conviction must have been 5 years or more. The scheduled offences include serious non-fatal offences against the person, aggravated burglary, firearms and explosives offences, drug trafficking offences, and organised crime offences.Presumptive minimum sentences also apply to certain firearms offences.  Unlike mandatory or mandatory minimum sentences, presumptive minimum sentences allow a judge, who is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist, to depart from the mandatory or mandatory minimum sentence specified in statute and impose a lesser sentence.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Oireachtas revisited this sentencing approach in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 in order to refine the  statutory provisions to ensure that they adequately captured the intention of the Oireachtas and also to extend its application to certain firearms offences and repeat offenders.  As set out in the Programme for Government, I intend to introduce a formal review process to assess the effects of these changes.

These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.However, I understand that the persons concerned are refugees.  In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible, having regard to the general volume of applications on hand.  It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the applications will commence in the coming months.I will inform the Deputy and the individuals in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), she was informed, by letter dated 16 June 2007, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her children.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of deportation orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  This communication also advised the person concerned of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with regulations known as the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the individual case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The person concerned was advised of his entitlement to appeal this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal but did not do so.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 6 December 2005, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of him and his children.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he and his children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned.On 10 October 2006, regulations known as the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006), came into force.  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned will be passed to me for decision.With regard to the issue raised by the Deputy about the provision of legal services to the person concerned, an examination of the case file of the person concerned indicates that he has engaged the services of a legal representative at all stages of the asylum and immigration processes.  As a result, I see no justification for an intervention of the nature referred to by the Deputy.

Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  Persons who have been granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national do not qualify for consideration under this scheme.The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  In the case of a non-national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish citizen those conditions are that the applicant must:be of full agebe of good characterbe married to the Irish citizen for at least 3 yearsbe in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsistingbe living together as husband and wife with the Irish spousehave had a period of one year's continuous residency in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application, and during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years.intend in good faith to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisationhave made, either before a judge of the District Court in open Court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.It is open to any non-EEA national to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements.

A stamp 4 is normally granted to successful applications and this entitles a non-EEA national spouse to reside in the State, work without the requirement of a work permit, operate a business without applying for business permission from my Department or study within the State without the requirement for further permission.  Such permission is not granted automatically and cases which require further investigation are referred to my Department.

These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The Deputy has not provided any information which would warrant taking this application out of sequence.It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence towards the middle of 2009.I will inform the Deputy and the person concerned when I have reached a decision on the matter.

That being the case, the Deputy might wish to note the process undergone by each asylum applicant as follows:An application for asylum is considered at first instance by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, in the event of an appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The statutory brief of both of those bodies, as set out in the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, is, inter alia, to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in each individual case, as to whether each applicant should, or should not, be declared to be a refugee.  I, as Minister, decide whether to grant or refuse refugee status.Similarly, following consideration of an application from a person who has been refused refugee status for consideration under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, for temporary leave to remain in the State, I as Minister, decide whether to grant or refuse such leave to remain. Further, when temporary leave to remain in the State is refused by me pursuant to my statutory powers as Minister, this results in the signing of a deportation order by me.The person concerned had his asylum claims examined by both the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that he did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The Deputy will appreciate that these bodies, as stated earlier, are not charged with responsibility for considering applications for permission to remain in the State pursuant to the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).Furthermore, the Deputy should note that the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory body, independent in the performance of its functions under the provisions of sections 15 and 16 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended). The effective management of the Tribunal is the responsibility of the Chairperson who in accordance with the section 14 of the second schedule of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) "shall endeavour to ensure that the business of the Tribunal is managed efficiently and that the business assigned to each division is disposed of as expeditiously as may be consistent with fairness and natural justice”. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 24 April 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

He claimed asylum on 31 May 2002  and his application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned was informed by letter dated 24 May 2004 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e why he should not be deported.His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 21 July 2005 my predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB),13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 4 August 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. He presented as required and was given further presentation dates which he kept. He is due to present again on Thursday 6 March 2008.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.The Deputy might wish to note that, in addition to the eleven factors contained in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), I must, as stated earlier, also have regard for Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement before making a deportation order. This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), in evaluating the safety of making returns to Guinea and other third countries. In this case, I am entirely satisfied that there are no refoulement related reasons to prevent the deportation of the person concerned.Further, I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and subsequently for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.The enforcement of the deportation order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

The RIA received a transfer request from this family on 9 January 2008 and a reply issued to this request dated 16 January 2008 stating that the request had been considered and that the reasons and supporting documentation supplied with the transfer request were insufficient to warrant a transfer in this case.The Deputy may wish to note that the RIA currently operates 63 centres across 23 counties providing accommodation to over 6,700 asylum seekers. There are high occupancy levels at all centres including both Athlone and Mosney. Transfers between centres where the basis is medical grounds require clear and compelling medical evidence which specifies the reason why a particular accommodation is not suitable having regard to those medical grounds. Once clear and compelling medical evidence is provided to the RIA, such evidence is referred to an independent medical referee for review and recommendation. Where grounds are found by the RIA to be compelling and where alternative appropriate accommodation is available, the RIA will grant and effect the transfer.

As Ireland has a challenging greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol, the economic effectiveness of any such project or scheme that issues carbon credits requires careful consideration.  The key issues, which are set out in Chapter 10 of the Strategy, include the relevance of existing sectoral support mechanisms and whether any such project or scheme could achieve emissions reductions that are additional to reductions from existing measures.In line with the commitment in the Strategy, the feasibility of domestic offsetting projects and schemes will be kept under review as international rules concerning such schemes evolve and in the light of experience in other countries.  Having regard to all of the considerations set out in the Chapter 10 of the Strategy, I would be happy to examine any specific proposal for a project or scheme from any sector.

The fire authority submitted detailed design drawings and a cost plan in respect of the project to the Department in September 2006.Based on the documentation submitted, in April 2007, the Department approved the fire authority's proposal to invite tenders for the construction of the station.I understand that the fire authority is currently modifying the original design of the proposed station. As a consequence, new design drawings as well as a revised cost plan are being prepared for submission to the Department. I also understand that a site has been purchased for the proposed fire station.

The 2006 National Disability Authority Report on Compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 in regard to employment of people with disabilities in the public service acknowledges that, because a different definition of disability, and in many cases a different data collection method, was used, the results presented in the report are not comparable with figures for previous years in respect of individual public bodies. It also recognises that differences between public bodies in how they collected the data make it difficult to compare results across these bodies.Local Authority%

Under the terms of the WEEE Directive, financing the environmentally sound management, including recycling, of electrical and electronic equipment is solely a producer responsibility. Two collective compliance schemes, functioning under the responsibility of producers, are operating in Ireland.These compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform, are responsible for ensuring that all recovered household WEEE is managed in an environmentally sound manner and for putting in place tracking and auditing systems for materials recovery in line with the requirements of the Directive. They do not, however, have a licensing function.The compliance schemes are also responsible for the procurement of the environmentally sound management, including recycling, of all household WEEE deposited at designated collection points. These include civic amenity facilities and retail outlets.It is up to each commercial enterprise to source its own feed stock for its recycling and/or refurbishment operations.  It is not appropriate for Government to interfere in the market.Strategic guidance on the implementation and operation of the WEEE Directive is being provided through the WEEE Monitoring Group which has identified the reuse of appliances, having regard to sustainable environmental best practice and/or health and safety requirements, as a priority objective.In order to promote and maximise opportunities for the reuse of appliances, my Department brought a group of stakeholders together during 2007.  This group included representatives of producers (some of whom have their own reuse programmes), retailers, the waste management sector, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the social  economy sector.  Following from this, a reuse protocol is being developed, which will set out the responsibilities of all stakeholders.  It is envisaged that this process will be completed in 2008.

The scheme was subsequently placed on a permanent footing.  As indicated in the reply to Question No. 187 of 27 February 2008, it is now open to local authorities to introduce community wardens having regard to local circumstances.  While funding to a total of €9.49 million was provided by my Department to support the pilot programme, the financing of a community warden service is now a matter for individual local authorities, including those who took part in the pilot programme.The duties of community wardens fall under three main headings, namely:The enforcement of a range of local authority functions, including certain traffic offences, litter offences and casual trading;The monitoring of housing estates, tourist attractions and public amenities and the reporting of breaches of environmental or planning legislation; andCommunity liaison.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-03-06 00:00:00	Prelude	648	Section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was commenced with effect from 28 April, 2004, introduced a "once-off" system of registration for all quarries, except those for which planning permission was granted in the previous five years.  Under the registration system, quarry operators were required to supply full details of their operations to the planning authorities by 27 April 2005.  Planning authorities were also required to consult with local communities regarding the operation of any quarry registered with them.The implementation of the provisions of Section 261 is a matter for each planning authority.  The provisions are designed to enable authorities better to regulate the operation of quarries in their functional area by providing them with comprehensive information on such quarries and increasing their power of control over quarrying operations.  Following registration, a planning authority could impose conditions on the operation of a pre-October 1964 quarry or could require such a quarry to apply for planning permission and submit an Environmental Impact Statement in certain circumstances.  Authorities could also restate, modify or add to conditions on the operation of a quarry which had received planning permission more than 5 years before the commencement of section 261.At the same time as the commencement of section 261, Ministerial Guidelines on Quarrying and Ancillary Activities were published under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which requires both planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to have regard to such guidelines in the performance of their functions.  These Guidelines (which are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie) offer guidance to planning authorities, both in development planning and in determining applications for planning permission in respect of quarrying activity.  They are intended to help planning authorities to assess the range of likely environmental effects, and to propose appropriate mitigation measures, particularly at the pre-application consultation stage.  They also include a practical guide to the implementation of section 261.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.There are a number of platforms for delivery of broadband, and service providers are now offering broadband by wireless, satellite, fibre or standard telephone cable and more recently, mobile, in many areas of the country.  My Department operates a dedicated website, www.broadband.gov.ie where potential broadband customers can ascertain the availability of services in their area.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved, including any unserved areas of County Longford and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008 and that implementation of services will commence as soon as possible thereafter.

As stated in my reply of 30 January last this relief was operated under a competitive process in accordance with EU State Aids Rules.  While some individual applicants may not have been successful, significant support has been made available to the production and use of PPO in Ireland.
