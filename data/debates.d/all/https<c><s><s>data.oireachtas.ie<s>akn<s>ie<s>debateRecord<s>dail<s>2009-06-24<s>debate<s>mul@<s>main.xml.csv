#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The House is debating a Private Members' motion in the names of Deputy James Reilly and all Fine Gael Deputies on cutbacks at Crumlin hospital.  This is a matter of serious concern, particularly to the parents of the children involved.  The Taoiseach is aware that Crumlin hospital provides 80% of the country's specialist treatment for children.During the course of the debate last night, the Minister for Health and Children stated: "I find it strange that when we ask hospitals to make efficiency savings, some hospitals decide that the most sensitive area is the one that must be cut first."  This statement amounts to an outrageous attack on the doctors and nurses who keep this element of our health service ticking over.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	2	As the Taoiseach is well aware from his visits to Crumlin hospital, parents who go through its doors are not looking for a manager or Professor Drumm, but a doctor or nurse to treat their sick children.  This is probably the most emotive and sensitive aspect of health.  I have visited the hospital many times.  The children there have cancer, holes in their hearts, curved spines and so on.  Their problems are the most sensitive.Does the Taoiseach believe and accept the Minister's statement last night that doctors and nurses are effectively victimising children with serious illnesses in the interests of saving money?  If he does not, will he ask her to withdraw her outrageous attack or remove her from her position?

The Minister for Health and Children was making the point that, before last Monday——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	6	——evening, it was being suggested that it would be necessary to close theatres and wards.  That would be the job of the board of management and the management of the hospital.  The board met on Monday evening and thankfully was in a position, with no changes to the budgetary arrangements, to make a decision that ensures that this in fact will not be the case.I think that what the Minister for Health and Children is simply trying to outline is that an excellent service is being provided by that hospital.  A reputation has been hard won and built up over many years.  In the context of finite budgets, even in the context of this year's budget of a 3% reduction compared to last year, there is an increased level of activity in Crumlin hospital, which itself is confirmation that, through more efficiencies and more effective management of the resources, it is possible to increase throughput and output without generating the need for extra resources per se.There will always be, in the context of any hospital or any health facility in the event of more resources being available, the possibility of more throughput and output in activity being able to be generated, but we have all agreed in the House for many years that it is only through service planning on a year-to-year basis that we can provide a sustainable health service.  Working within those budgets, Crumlin management and its board of management were able to make a decision where, in fact, the closures that were regarded as necessary or unavoidable before last Monday's meeting thankfully did not come to pass because of the fact that they were able to make other decisions.

I asked him whether he believed the Minister for Health and Children's statement to the effect that she found it strange that the first cut to be made would be in the most sensitive area, thereby directly attacking doctors and nurses——

The layers of bureaucracy above them, created in the bureaucratic monster funded by the Taoiseach and the Minister, are responsible.The Taoiseach did not tell me that St. Joseph's ward is closed or that 4,000 bed days will consequently be lost.  He did not tell me that 800 operations for young and sick children will be delayed this year.  These facts were determined and witnessed by the Members of the Oireachtas, including some from Fianna Fáil, who visited Crumlin hospital yesterday.Savings of just over €9 million are being sought in a system built up and funded by the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harney, and through which she is making an outrageous attack on doctors, nurses and other front line staff.  Between 2007 and 2008, €60 million was spent on taxis and transport.  A 10% efficiency would have created 66% of what Crumlin hospital needs this year.  Bonuses for HSE bosses amounted to almost €1.5 million in 2007.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Outside consultants and PR cost €17 million last year.  In her contribution last night, the Minister admitted that we are spending too much on advisers and outside consultants.  On the growth of bureaucracy in the Health Service Executive, HSE, there were six grade eight senior management positions in 2000.  Now there are more than 700.  Despite all of that administration, there is at least €160 million in unpaid bills to hospitals.  Advisers to Government last year cost €6.2 million.  Some of that expenditure was transferred into the Taoiseach's Department from the Minister for Health and Children's budget.  There is no evidence of any efficiency being created by Government in the HSE.Let me return to the point I made at the outset, children from all over the country have to visit Crumlin hospital when they have a major problem.  I spoke to a mother in the hospital recently who was sleeping in a room for three months with her head under the sink while her child with cancer was receiving treatment.  The Taoiseach is aware that doctors and nurses work under the most pressurised conditions in that hospital to deliver what they know they can do best, namely, the sensitive treatment of major operations for young children.  What happened in the House last night amounts to an outrageous attack on the nurses and doctors in Crumlin by the Minister for Health and Children.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	16	This is not the kind of health system we want.  This party will assist the Government to bring about efficiencies so that children can get treatment when they need it.  When parents burst through the doors of a hospital, it is not Professor Drumm they are looking for, it is not a manager nor a senior executive at grade eight level, it is a doctor and a nurse who will be able to treat their child.  As Deputy Reilly has pointed out, the longer one leaves curvature of the spine problems, the more costly it will be and the more interventions that will be required to bring children to a point where they can live a normal life.Where does the Taoiseach expect to make efficiencies this year so that Crumlin hospital will not have to cut back on operations?  Does he agree with the Minister for Health and Children's statement that doctors and nurses are deliberately victimising children with serious illness in the interests of saving money?  If he does not agree with that statement, will he ask her to withdraw it or remove her from her position?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	29	What it means is that there is a need to manage the resource and direct it to the priority areas where it is required.  It was directed not just in this specific case but generally to all boards of management in voluntary hospitals and to the HSE in respect of those hospitals that are run by the HSE.  The reforms are ongoing and they are providing savings and putting clinicians at the front line.  The whole purpose of the reforms the Minister has been leading is to bring hospital teams together to work for a better output for the resource that is available.  That is being achieved by bringing forward clinical directors and involving clinicians in decision making and the management of hospitals, rather than have people acting individually as consultants within the hospitals.  That is the case with many important services, including cancer services.  It was suggested last week, for example, that cancer services would come to an end in Galway but that proved not to be the case either.  If one looks at it simply on the basis of a status quo, against a background of a finite and challenging budgetary situation, then one has to make changes to ensure we get the outputs we need.  The fact of the matter is that on page 19 of the Fine Gael Party’s pre-budget statement it is suggested that efficiencies of 3% should be imposed on all health budgets.

When people lose their jobs they apply for social welfare payments.  It usually takes a number of weeks for a social welfare payment to be processed and paid.  If there is any complication with a claim, for example, if the paperwork is wrong, in particular if somebody has been self-employed, it can take much longer.  In some cases it takes three months but it may be more before a social welfare payment is made.  While somebody who has lost his or her job is waiting for a social welfare payment, he or she is expected to go to the health centre to make an application to the community welfare officer for supplementary welfare assistance.  The problem now is that the community welfare system is creaking under the strain due to the large numbers of people who are turning up, and due to the impact of the Government recruitment and replacement embargo.Let me give the Taoiseach a couple of examples.  The community welfare officer in the Loughlinstown health centre in my constituency has been out sick for the past four weeks approximately.  He was replaced, and his replacement is now out sick.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	77	There has been no community welfare officer in the centre for the past several weeks.  The community welfare officer in the Dún Laoghaire health centre has been out sick for the past three or four weeks, and there is no community welfare officer there either.  I have heard of a number of other cases where community welfare officers are on holidays, which is perfectly understandable.  The difficulty is that people are turning up at the centres but there is nobody to deal with their claims.I met a man who has been out of work since 11 May.  He has not received a payment of any kind from social welfare or the community welfare officer.  He told me that but for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul he would have starved.  I met another person who is out of work since January of last year who has a mortgage and is under pressure from the financial institution to pay the mortgage arrears.  The person is entitled to mortgage interest relief but cannot get a community welfare officer to make a decision on it.  Another woman, who was self-employed, has been trying to reach a community welfare officer for three weeks to address her requirements.  I received a report stating people queued for two and a half hours at the Loughlinstown health centre this day last week to meet a community welfare officer, only to be told eventually that none would appear to deal with their problems.  I do not blame the community welfare officers because I know them and realise they have done and are doing a fine job in very difficult circumstances.There are two problems that must be urgently addressed.  First, many of the people who are now attending at social welfare and community welfare offices have never had any contact with the social welfare system and never wanted to have any.  It is a grim experience for them to find themselves out of work with no social welfare payment coming through and to discover the emergency service that is supposed to assist them is not available and nobody is present to deal with their problem.  Second, there is a problem with the degree of pressure and stress now experienced by the community welfare service as a result of the large numbers attending and of the complicated circumstances of those who are presenting to make claims.  I refer to those coming out of self-employment with varying types of social welfare records.What will the Government do to ensure somebody who is already in bad circumstances as a result of having lost his job will receive the service to which he is entitled when he turns up at a social welfare or community welfare office?  Will there be sufficient staff drafted in to ensure an adequate service is provided to meet the increasing demand?  The service was dealing with approximately 150,000 unemployed people but there are now 400,000.  The service needs to be adjusted to meet the new demand.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I take the point that the Department of Social and Family Affairs has an increased workload as a result of the unfortunate rise in unemployment, particularly over the past 12 months.  That point is known to all of us as constituency Members in so far as we have dealt with social welfare claims.Some 365 staff have been transferred from other Departments to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and further transfers will be required.  Deputy Gilmore has outlined to me some of the problems in his constituency regarding the sick leave of community welfare officers.  I do not know the specific details.  As the Deputy knows, there has been a long-standing industrial relations issue regarding the transfer of community welfare officer staff from the HSE to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, despite many attempts to address this on everyone's behalf.  Bringing this process to a successful conclusion will greatly assist with the management of the situation, quite apart from addressing the extra pressures people are experiencing due to changed circumstances.Special dedicated units have been established by the Minister, on her direction, to deal solely with claims, improve the throughput and reduce assessment and waiting times.  An appointment system is in place in some offices and it is being rolled out nationally over time to assist people in avoiding queues.  The Minister is aware of the need for a dignified effort by everybody to assist those who have to make social welfare claims.I take the point that some people never believed it probable they would be dependent on social welfare payments during their careers.  This issue, including the need to have more staff in the Department, is being dealt with as a matter of priority by the Minister.  I will have to check the specific community welfare officer issues raised by the Deputy and revert to him on why there may be a problem with the officers' replacement.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	79	My purpose in raising this problem is to get it solved.  I am concerned about those who have lost their jobs.  It is stressful for them in any event and involves a considerable change to their living circumstances.  Suddenly having to turn to the social welfare service for assistance is bad enough but it is even worse if that assistance is not available and if one turns up at one's local office on any given week and finds a notice on the window stating there will be no staff present.  This is not acceptable.  If the process is working like this in the constituency of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, which I have the honour of sharing with her, I suspect it is happening elsewhere also.  I know it is from colleagues.  I want to see the problem resolved such that one's social welfare claim will be dealt with promptly and that there will be a member of staff available to meet one at the social welfare office.Apart from the consequences of the delays for the individual, which are my primary concern, there are knock-on consequences.  My colleague, Deputy Higgins, drew attention recently to the consequences of the delays for people being offered short-term work.  If an unemployed person takes up an offer of short-term work for a week or two, he will be placed at the end of the queue when he re-applies for social welfare.  Somebody who has had to wait three months for his claim to be processed and who has had the experience I have described in respect of community welfare officers will wonder what will happen next time at the social welfare office when his or her short-term job is finished.  Apart from the need to resolve the problem in the interest of the unemployed, it must be resolved in the interest of the existing cohort of community welfare officers who are under strain.  It is a very stressful to be dealing with the number of claims being made at present and the system, as it operates, acts as a disincentive to unemployed people to take up short-term work.  I ask that the matter be dealt with promptly.  I will return to it if it is not.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	80	As I stated, I understand there is an accelerated process for people moving in and out of work and those requiring FÁS training, etc.  The Deputy highlighted two points that are valid and need to be addressed.  They are being addressed to the best of our ability under present arrangements.  Reviewing present arrangements in terms of flexibilities across the public service and getting people to the point of contact at the pressure points more quickly are in the interest of all of us who wish to defend public services and see them provided in a timely and appropriate away.In the context of the social partnership talks we are having at present on a sector by sector basis, there are discussions taking place on how we can improve the system, through the transforming public services agenda, to provide sufficient personnel when services pressures are particularly severe in specific areas of activity.  Everyone must be prepared to review existing agreements and arrangements for this to happen, as Deputy Gilmore will know from the expertise he gained during his career in industrial relations.  There is a requirement in general policy terms that all of us step up to the mark to ensure we can deal with these matters in a timely and appropriate way.  The processes and systems we have in place in the industrial relations area mean, as the Deputy said, those who are dependent on services, whether for a temporary or more prolonged period, find their availability is not quite what they would desire.It is in the interest of all of us who believe in public services to have flexibility on the ground to achieve the required outputs and service levels so they will be made available to those who have lost their jobs in a timely and appropriate way.  This point is well made and the Government is making it in the social partnership talks.  It needs to be addressed successfully by all of us collaboratively so we will achieve the outcomes people desire.The industrial relations problem concerning community welfare officers generally has been with us for far too long.  As the Deputy knows, there has been a series of recommendations——

We need more and we need them more quickly to ensure that service is available.  We need to update the processes so that this happens in a more timely and expeditious way.  That should be done, while respecting everyone's position, so that the people who depend on the service, not the service providers who have a job on their hands, get it as they need it.  That is the challenge for the transforming public services agenda and we are addressing it sector by sector.  My colleague will furnish the full information on how to rectify the specific problem the Deputy raises as soon as possible.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together. I attended the European Council on 18 and 19 June in Brussels.  As I will make a statement to the House later today, I will merely give a summary account of the proceedings.The European Council took several important decisions on future financial regulation within the Union with the aim of protecting the European financial system from future risks and ensuring that the mistakes of the past can never be repeated.  Ireland fully accepts the need and indeed the urgency of putting in place the proposed new system.  There was also a discussion on the European economic recovery plan and on employment in particular.In respect of climate change, the main goal of the Council was to ensure a comprehensive and effective agreement at global level later this year in Copenhagen.  With that goal in mind, last week's discussions and conclusions move the Union's position along so that we can continue to provide leadership in the international negotiations.  It will be necessary to return to this issue at our October meeting.  The Council also discussed illegal migration.From an Irish perspective, the key focus of the Council was gaining agreement on the legally binding guarantees to respond to the concerns of the Irish people.  I am pleased to tell the House that we secured the guarantees that we required on tax, neutrality and ethical issues.  I am obliged to the leaders of the Opposition parties for their support for the Lisbon treaty.  The 27 Heads of State and Government also agreed that these will become part of the treaties by means of a protocol.  The Union also reaffirmed the importance of workers' rights and public services.  We had already reached agreement that each member state would retain a Commissioner, and that was re-confirmed last week.The outcome from the European Council is of huge significance to Ireland.  Since the referendum last June, our objective has been to address the concerns expressed by the people.  I believe that these concerns have been addressed.  On this basis, I will recommend to the Government that we return to the people to seek their approval for Ireland to ratify the treaty.  I expect that the referendum will take place in early October.The guarantees we have secured make it crystal clear that Ireland remains in control of its own tax rates; Irish neutrality is unaffected by the treaty, for example the idea of conscription or a European army is nonsense; and the protections in the Irish Constitution on the right to life, education and the family are not in any way affected by the Lisbon treaty.I had several discussions with Prime Minister Brown over the course of the Council, which focused on Ireland's legal guarantees.  I also had discussions with many of my Council colleagues during the Council including Prime Minister Fischer, President of the European Council, about those guarantees.In respect of my travel plans for the remainder of 2009, it is my intention to attend the British Irish Council on 13 November in Jersey.  I will also, of course, attend the remaining European Council meetings in October and December.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I was happy to attend in Brussels with the leaders of the European People's Party, EPP.  All the prime ministers were there except the Belgian Prime Minister who had to attend a state visit from the King of Jordan.  All those leaders were very much in favour of supporting Ireland's case for the guarantees that were promised last September.  I was happy to see at the conclusion of the Council meeting that our European counterparts delivered on these guarantees.There was never any intention of changing the Lisbon treaty.  People who voted ‘No' say there has been no change in the treaty but there was no intention of so doing.  I never favoured the reopening of the ratification process in other countries.  The conclusion of the Council meeting creates much greater clarity in the matters of concern to people, the ethical issues, European defence and security, taxation, conscription and so on, including workers' rights.  That leaves an opportunity for all the parties that support the treaty to campaign in such a way that people can be fully and comprehensively informed when they go to vote about what is and is not in the treaty.Did the Taoiseach invite any of the leaders of our EU partners to visit Ireland before October, either in respect of the broad question of co-operation with Europe or specifically of matters of interest to Ireland?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I thank Deputy Kenny for the part he played in ensuring that our colleagues and his colleagues in the EPP political grouping of prime ministers and leaders were helpful and supportive and understood what Ireland sought.  I agree that the clarifications and confirmations we received have legal effect.  They are not simply the interpretations of 27 member states but are a form of Council decision which gives legal effect to what is intended in the treaty in respect of the issues and areas of concern that Ireland raised.The texts provided are the ones we sought.  They were agreed to and are given the legal effect of a Council decision and there is an undertaking to attach a protocol to the next accession treaty in the European Union when a further enlargement takes place.  That will give full treaty status to that decision.  No eminent person or lawyer with knowledge of international law or the law of treaties doubts for one moment that the confirmations, clarifications and texts of the legal decisions that we have obtained and which will become a protocol in due course have the same status as the treaty provisions.  That is so without doubt or impediment.There is no formal arrangement with any Heads of State or Government to visit Ireland between now and the referendum.  Colleagues have indicated that they are prepared to help in any way that is deemed appropriate.  In a discussion over dinner about the nomination of Mr. Barroso as President of the Commission I said that for the tenure of this Commission all of us engaged in politics, whether as leaders of parties or Heads of Government or State need to visit and engage more with each other on the European agenda, to bring to the attention of their national electorates the importance and relevance of the European Union in their day to day lives.  We need to develop a political narrative here as in other member states that would engage the citizenry of Europe to a far greater extent than has proved possible.  In our case, we had local elections at the same time as the European elections and we would all agree that the turnout for European elections was far higher as a result.The basic point to be made generally, as we have done previously when discussing European matters at Question Time, is that we need to build on the all-party committee's work and the clarifications that emanated from that process of discourse, discussion and political thinking.  It brought a great degree of clarity and political nous to addressing the issue.The European Union was given an opportunity to show solidarity with the Irish people in respect of the decision that was made last year and it worked at its best, which in many respects kills off the argument about a European Union that seeks to impose on Ireland things it does not wish to have.  It is far better to recognise that smaller states' interests are considered.  It is true that the basis upon which we were able to move forward was that there would not be a re-ratification of the Lisbon treaty in other member states.  This was the sole condition that enabled them to assist us in trying to bring clarity and confirmation to the issues of concern of the Irish people.  That being said, the fact that we will obtain a protocol in respect of these concerns and this decision is indicative of the full solidarity that has been displayed and the spirit of generosity and consensus that is part of the modus operandi of the European Union working at its best.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Taoiseach can rest assured that the Fine Gael Party will do all in its power to work towards the successful ratification of the Lisbon treaty by the Irish electorate and I say that in the broadest sense that we can assist here.Yesterday, the Taoiseach indicated that the Bill would come to the House the week after next.  What is his intention with regard to establishing the referendum commission which will have the task of dispensing accurate information to the people?  How does the Taoiseach see that being resourced and how soon does he expect to receive an answer from the High Court with regard to the chairperson?On previous occasions, I have stated that the sectors in Irish life who were concerned about the Lisbon treaty are still sore because of their perception of how directives have been interpreted here.  The classic example is that of fishing, where Ireland has interpreted a directive in a way that requires a criminal charge to be applied for even the most minor indiscretion — and I stress "minor".  All other countries of the Union have an administrative regime for minor indiscretions.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe produced a Private Members' Bill to deal with this and the best legal advice available to us stands up.The Government should consider providing the Oireachtas committees which deal with European affairs and European scrutiny a remit or mandate to examine at least some of the directives where we know difficulties were created to see whether it is possible to implement them in a more common sense or flexible fashion without losing the intent or import of what they state.  I do not mean all of the directives because there has been a river of them.  This would be beneficial from the Government's point of view.  I know from personal experience that various sectors throughout the country had difficulties and people told me they could not vote for the treaty on the previous occasion because of their perception that red tape was strangling business.  In the interests of dealing with these concerns, will the Government examine this matter?  This would allow us to deal with the genuine concerns of people and have this problem eased so that when they go to vote, these obstacles will have been removed from their thought process.In the event that Ireland approves the Lisbon treaty the fact that we are to have reviews of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy will allow us to look to the future in a way that we have not been able in the past and at the potential that will exist over the next 20 years with the rise in world population and the quality of what we can produce here, and the opportunity that exists for the fishing interests in terms of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	91	With regard to the referendum commission, the process has begun with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government writing to the President of the High Court asking for the nomination of a High Court judge as chairman of the referendum commission.  On receipt of this, the commission will be established in line with precedent.  There is a provision in the Estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs for expenditure on a commission for a European referendum this year.  It is hoped that the commission will assist in providing objective analysis and interpretation of the meaning of the treaty in a way that will be helpful to the electorate.With regard to the proportionality of the implementation of directives or regulations, regulations have direct legal effect and directives require to be transposed into national law.  The principle of proportionality is important as is the need for the transposition to be consistent with the directive.  I cannot speak on any specific directive that it is being implemented, but stress-testing for proportionality many of the directives that are being implemented would be an ongoing work programme for the relevant committees of the House and would be of great service to the Oireachtas and the Executive.  It would be a matter for the chairmen of the Oireachtas committees to decide how this would be done and it would certainly assist the democratic process.To make a general point on voting "Yes", the Lisbon treaty contains an innovative provision on enhancing the role of national parliaments which is new and different from previous treaties of the Union.  It gives a new and formal role within the EU to national parliaments as all proposals for EU legislation will be forwarded to them for their consideration.  National parliaments will have a period of eight weeks in which to vet proposals and offer opinions on them and if enough national parliaments object to a particular proposal, it can be either amended or withdrawn.  Any national parliament can block moves to increase the number of policy issues that can be decided by majority voting.  The role proposed for national parliaments in the Lisbon treaty is a real innovation.  For those who are concerned about the need for the principle of proportionality to be given practical effect in the implementation of European legislation in national law, a "Yes" vote for the Lisbon treaty improves that prospect because the new role given to national parliaments in the treaty provides them with a real opportunity not only to give their views, but a sufficient number of parliaments can impose their will to amend or withdraw proposals they find objectionable.

However, equally, wrong and false assertions were made by the "Yes" side.  I will clarify one assertion.  Voting "No" to the Lisbon treaty does not mean we are voting "No" to the European Union and the consequence of voting "No" is not that Ireland will be pushed out of the Union any more than we faced that prospect following the rejection of the first Nice and Lisbon treaties.  It is important that people have confidence in listening to the arguments going forward to participate in the referendum, which the Taoiseach signalled will be held in early October, that they know exactly what they are voting about.  It is about the Lisbon treaty and what that implies for Ireland's sense of its place in Europe and of how Europe will manage its affairs going forward and not about Ireland's future role in the Union.Can the Taoiseach also confirm that when the people are asked to vote on the referendum in October, it will be on exactly the same treaty that was presented to them last year without a single comma or full stop being changed in the text of the treaty and without being altered in any way?  Deputy Kenny confirmed this earlier when he stated: "There was never any intention of changing the Lisbon treaty."  Does the Taoiseach accept that people like me who took a "No" position on the treaty as presented last year feel he and the Government have not in fact sought any change to the treaty, despite what I and many people believe was a clear and unequivocal statement from the people in the referendum campaign and result?Following the European Council meeting, we have the promise of a protocol on neutrality, taxation and what many would describe as ethical issues.  How will this promise become a protocol?  Will he outline exactly how that will translate into a protocol?  It has been stated it will be attached to a future accession treaty.  Which accession treaty?  When does he expect the treaty to be presented?  Will he confirm that the protocol will not be attached to a treaty and, therefore, will not be legally binding until after the people have voted on the Lisbon treaty for a second time and we will not see a protocol attached to a treaty in advance of the second request of the Irish electorate to pass judgment on the treaty?We all recognise EU law provides that all states must ratify a treaty before it comes into effect.  In Ireland's case, the view of many people across the country who have watched the unfolding events since last year is that the Government did not respect and, indeed, abandoned, the decision of the electorate last year.  The Taoiseach has disagreed with this and defended his position stoutly over the period since.

How does he answer the fact that this is not what he has done and, as Deputy Kenny said, that was never the intention either of Government or Opposition parties who supported his position on the treaty?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	101	With regard to the question about the non-ratification of the treaty, the European treaties will be then based on the Treaty of Nice and previous treaties.  It is an important issue for the Union because the Commission must be appointed.  The tenure of the Commission expires in November and the basis on which it is to be appointed is a fundamental issue.  Is it to be appointed under the Treaty of Nice provisions or under the Treaty of Lisbon provisions?  That certainty must be brought to bear and, for that reason, Ireland intends holding a second referendum to facilitate how that is to proceed.The next question raised by the Deputy relates to a "No" vote to the treaty having no effect.  It has no effect on our continuing membership of the Union, as things stand, but to suggest there would be no practical political effects flies in the face not only of what one can reasonably contemplate or foresee in the future, but of what has been the experience in recent times.  If Ireland wants to convey the point, as it can and should do, that it wants to be at the heart of the Union and to shape the events that will shape us, that we will work with others on how climate change and energy security are to be handled and how we will ensure that we are at the end of a pipeline and have energy security, that we will have common policies on agriculture, that we will have access to the Single Market and that we will be seen to be fully committed, energetic and enthusiastic participants in a Union that has brought undoubted benefits to this country, please be assured that the best way in which we can convince our partners that is the case is by voting "Yes" to the treaty to which we have all signed up.If it is being suggested that one should vote "No" to remain at the heart of the Union and that by voting "No" we will maintain a position, goodwill will flow to Ireland and, in some way, Ireland will have been very helpful, despite the fact that our interests, objectively and empirically, favour continuing with the project on the basis of a consensus that has been achieved over many years of negotiation in which Ireland has been centrally involved and 90% of the treaty's provisions are based on a draft constitutional treaty that was negotiated during our Presidency in which all of our issues were protected, I am afraid that flies in the face of political logic.The idea is suggested that after years of negotiation, Ireland is in the very same position while the will of the governments of the other 26 member states is expressed in the context of proceeding with a Union that reforms itself for the purpose of more effective decision making, of better Single Market provision and of protecting the rules that enable small states to compete on the same basis as large states in what is one of the most lucrative and important export markets in the world while we depend for our livelihoods on exporting 95% of what we create and produce and getting a price for it, thereby earning wages and creating jobs and investment as a result.  Is it being seriously suggested that we can have all the benefits of membership while flying in the face of a consensus that has been painstakingly built up and constructed over many years?  I do not believe that unless one is subject to a serious degree of political naivety, one can hold a position that suggests that our position is unchanged.I agree that in legal terms the Treaty of Nice continues to ensure there is a European construct that will continue.  However, the idea that Ireland is in the same position politically as a result of concerns which were expressed being taken on board by our colleagues in an effort to ensure the people's choice is respected is wrong.  If the people vote "No" a second time to the Lisbon treaty, there will not be a treaty of Lisbon, with all the political consequences, whatever they are, that flow from that.  None of those consequences would be positive for this country.  How could they be positive for us?  I do not believe they could or that a sound argument could be made in that respect.However, it is not on that basis that those of us who support the European Union propose the people vote "Yes".  It is because we believe it is intrinsically in our national interest so to do.  All of the empirical evidence — economic, social, material etc. — of what has brought progress to this country has fundamentally been about the integration of the Irish economy into the European and wider global economy.  That is the means by which Ireland has produced what it has produced in recent times.Of course, there are aspects of the Union that are problematic and of course there are issues.  No one could suggest that every aspect of its operation suits everybody.  That is what compromise is about.  On the national question, Deputy Ó Caoláin's own party has brought that insight to bear.  Compromise is necessary for progress.  Not all of one's objectives can be achieved, but the means by which they can be achieved can be retained in the context of building a consensus.  The dynamic within the European Union is such that the objectives we seek from membership are not only possible, but in many respects are already available to us.This country has benefited from experiencing the availability of the realisation of those objectives, not least the fact that we have moved away from an utter dependence on our nearest neighbour in economic and political terms to a wider vista of opportunity that has brought jobs and dealt with the historic problem of underemployment and under-investment in our country.  Now, in the face of the major, unprecedented, economic and fiscal crisis that faces the world, Ireland, by being a member of a common currency, has available to it a zone of stability — a means by which we can survive this crisis and come out the far side with not only our freedom intact, but with the ability to manage our own affairs intact because we are part of this wider construct.  Those are the realities of 21st century Ireland.  Those are the realities we must contend and live with and through which we must survive.It is time we had a debate about the sort of Ireland we want in Europe, not the sort of Europe we feel best suits Ireland.  It is being part of a larger entity that gives us the prospects of success, not standing alone on the outside, half in and half out, wondering on the top of a legal pin whether it is this way or that way.  The great benefit of what was achieved last week is that it puts to bed, for any reasonable or rational discussion, the non-arguments that have dominated the European debate in this country, for example the idea there would be conscription.  I hear the Deputy say these are arguments with which he was never associated.  That may be true for him.  I do not doubt it if that is what he says.  However, the "No" campaign in its various manifestations did not dissociate itself from those arguments.  Its tactic was to pick and choose a bit here, a bit there and a bit everywhere else.That is the truth and that is how the coalition of "No" was assembled, not on the basis of any internal coherence to respective positions.  Some claimed Europe was not integrated enough, others claimed it was not sufficiently non-federalist, others suggested it undermined our basic rights, freedoms and constitutional protections and others said it imposed military conscription on our people.  I know of canvassers from the Deputy's party who said that at doors in my constituency.  I know them and know it was said.  This did not come off the top of their heads.  People work to direction.  I know that happened because I spoke to the constituents who told me it happened, who had no reason to tell me otherwise.I will not decide that is the litmus test of the debate, but it happened.  While the Deputy quite rightly dissociated himself from that, because it had no basis in fact, there were others who did not and who used it,  and suggested we might be part of a European army.  That came from those who claimed to be part of a different army some other time.  Let us get real here.  What we want to be real about is that these protections provide us with the means to get on with the argument about which Lemass, Cosgrave and Corish spoke.  Even at a time when they had differences, they spoke about the issues.  They spoke about their ideology and what they thought was in the best interest of the people on the basis of agreeing, at least, what was in front of them.  They did not engage themselves in the politics of confusion and obfuscation or in the politics of fear.  That democratic debate was a healthy debate.

This is on the basis of empirical objective evidence, the possibilities for the future and how we will cope with the problems we face currently, let alone the future.We could not survive this crisis without our membership of the eurozone and the availability of resources from the European Central Bank.  That has been a fact over the past 12 months.  It is an unassailable fact of life.  Does this mean in some way we have lost our sense of dignity or are beholden to anybody?  Not at all.  It means we are part of something bigger than ourselves.  It means that membership brings disciplines, impositions and obligations, as well as benefits.  Those disciplines and benefits have been for the betterment of this country and have brought us to where we are, with all our mistakes, failures and successes, with all the ups and downs of political life, successful or otherwise.

That is why it is called a protocol.  That is proof as to why it has full legal status.  It requires ratification.  One condition precedent was laid down by colleagues when I went to them after the rejection of the Lisbon treaty and explained as best I could, on the basis of what I saw, the reasons for the defeat of the treaty.  They said they would speak to Ireland about all those issues, listen to our concerns, seek to accommodate them on one condition, namely, that they should not have to re-ratify or reopen the ratification process already completed in their countries.  Out of respect for those countries, that was not an unreasonable requirement.  They had ratified the treaty.  This was in the aftermath ——

The Lisbon treaty represented a consensus many years in the making, in which we were centrally involved during our Presidency.  Great honour was brought to this country from the work we did at that time.  When we rejected the Lisbon treaty we went back to our counterparts and explained the reasons for its defeat.  Our colleagues said they would seek to accommodate our concerns, but they believed the treaty was fundamental, in terms of the enlargement of the Union for more effective decision making in the future.  We brought our concerns back, they have accorded them the status they require and have ensured the bogus arguments are eliminated.Let us get down to the real debate.  That is what I invite.  Let us have the debate.  People are entitled to different opinions on this issue, but let us have a debate about what it is we are signing up to, not what we never signed up to in the first place.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	113	We are dealing with questions arising from the summit meeting which took place last week.  Like Deputy Kenny, I attended a meeting of the leaders of the labour and social democratic parties, which was held in advance of the summit meeting.  I am very much aware that the conclusions which were reached at the summit meeting last Thursday were by no means a done deal and that there were significant difficulties in securing agreement and, in particular, securing agreement to have the legal guarantees attached as a protocol to a future treaty.I hope the contributions I and the Labour Party made in our dealings with the leaderships of some of our sister labour and social democratic parties in other states were helpful to the Taoiseach in securing the agreement reached at the summit.  I was very happy to do that because there are occasions when we have to put the country first and when issues of party political advantage, and the opportunism that sometimes goes with that, have to be set aside in the wider and better interests of the country.  That was one of those occasions.I welcome the outcome of the summit.  The Labour Party takes the view that the Lisbon treaty, as it was presented, did not compromise our neutrality or tax position and did not override our Constitution in certain respects, and that is why we supported it last June.  The legal guarantees which have been secured put beyond any doubt the concerns many people expressed during the course of the referendum.  I am glad the issues have been put beyond doubt and will be enshrined in protocols.  I also acknowledge that the agreement reached, namely, that if the Lisbon treaty is ratified each member state will have the right to nominate a Commissioner, is a significant change to what was before the people last June.I have a number of issues arising from the agreement I want to pursue with the Taoiseach.  In respect of the declaration on workers' rights, the Labour Party is very keen that those declarations and the commitments in the area of workers' rights, including those that are provided for in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, are given legislative effect in this State.  What is the Government's position now in respect of the commitments given to introduce legislation arising from the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and the subsequent amendment of that, and on giving legislative effect to the principles set down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights?Another issue I want to raise with the Taoiseach is the appointment of the President of the Commission.  As I understand it, the summit agreed to nominate the outgoing President, Mr. Barroso, for a further five-year term and it is intended that the nomination be put before the European Parliament for approval at its July meeting.  The Taoiseach will be aware that the political family to which the Labour Party belongs in Europe is seriously concerned about that process.  We are concerned about the neo-liberal agenda pursued by President Barroso in his outgoing five-year term and our wish is for that agenda to be at least amended.There is a proposal, which I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of, that President Barroso meet with the respective groupings in the European Parliament, in particular the party of European socialists, to outline his proposed agenda for the next five years and that the Parliament would be given sufficient time to consider President Barroso's agenda and that the process of his appointment would not be rushed at the July meeting.  Does the Taoiseach support that more considered approach to the reappointment of President Barroso, rather than what appeared to be coming from the summit, which was a very rushed approach towards his reappointment?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I thank Deputy Gilmore, as I thanked Deputy Kenny in respect of the grouping to which he is affiliated, for the work and clear exposition of the Irish position that they gave to colleagues, in terms of the value and worth of the guarantees we sought and the need to provide legal clarity and certainty on those in the interests of avoiding a re-run of issues in this debate.  The Council decision itself has immediate legal effect and is of legal standing in international law.  The commitment to a protocol in addition to that gives further re-affirmation or reassurance to people who may have had doubts or ascribed high importance to the issues that are the subject of the protocols and legal guarantees in the first place, as was outlined by the all-party committee which studied this matter in some detail in the aftermath of the last referendum.Regarding the question of the workers' rights declaration, which was agreed at the June European Council meeting, the EU reiterated, as the Deputy will know, the high importance which the Union attaches to social progress and protecting workers rights and public services, the responsibility of member states for the delivery of education and health services and the essential role and wide discretion of national, regional and local authorities in providing, commissioning and organising services of general economic interest.  The solemn declaration by the 27 member states of the EU underlines and highlights for all the value which the Union attaches to workers' rights and the provision of public services.As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the charter binds the European Union institutions in respect of how they abide by those principles and provide a means by which they can be judicially arbitrated upon by the ECJ in due course, if cases require it or people believe it is required.Regarding domestic legislation, we have continued our update with the social partners yesterday evening, in terms of meetings the partners are having today.  We reiterated our commitment to continue to work with them in the implementation of the legislative measures outlined in the agreement.  They remain the policy of Government to implement.  Some require finalisation and continuing discussion, but many are at an advanced stage, as the Deputy knows, and it is our intention to proceed with them in a timely and appropriate way.Regarding the question of the appointment of the President of the Commission, it is important to clarify the situation.  The process is where we indicated our intention, as Heads of State and Governments, to nominate Mr. Barroso.  There is a consultation requirement, as the Deputy is aware, with the Parliament itself.  Therefore, it is not a formal nomination at this point.  Rather, it is a question of indicating the unanimous view of the Heads of State and Governments, including members of one's own grouping who are Heads of State and Government at the European Council who believe the overriding interest is to provide not just institutional continuity, but the continuing leadership of President Barroso at a time when so many major issues that affect the European Union project need to be addressed and implemented.It is the strongly-held view of all Heads of State and Governments that we should indicate our support for him, so the consultation process now begins with the European Parliament in the knowledge that it would be our intention to nominate President Barroso and have their views on that matter.  In regard to parliamentary procedures and in the context of parliamentary rights and entitlements, we all know it can develop into a party grouping-type of arrangement.  It is important that President Barroso would enjoy the strong support of all groupings in the Parliament.  There are approximately 234 members of the European Parliament who are outside the three main groupings, for example.  It is important that the three main groupings should have a broad measure of support for the President of the Commission.For my part, I would like to see that matter resolved quickly.  I do not believe it is in the interests of the Union to do otherwise.  There is no need for serious inter-institutional conflict in regard to this matter, although this can at times be generated in view of partisan positions being adopted.  However, the broad leadership of the Council, within the Commission and in the Parliament itself should be such as to enable a degree of certainty to be brought to the Presidency of the Commission, which is what we are speaking about.The Commission acts collegially in respect of the policies and right of initiative that it brings, and it is for the Council to decide in regard to policy matters at the end of the day.  The Commission obviously also has an important role in protecting the integrity of the treaties and protecting the rights of all the member states.  A strong Commission is in our interest and is certainly in the interest of smaller states.  The inter-institutional balance is an important one, as the Deputy knows, and requires a person of considerable political experience to deal with the pressures that come to bear and the issues of the day that need to be addressed in a way that is consistent with the treaties while, at the same time, upholding the confidence of everyone within the various institutions, including the Council and the Parliament.Any influence that can be used by the leaders in this House regarding the groupings of which they are members should be used to bring that issue to finality.  I do not believe it should involve a contentious, drawn-out, conflictual situation.  People need to look at the big picture.  The question of the balance within the Commission is an issue that can be addressed.  It is a matter for President Barroso to decide what way he wishes to build support within the Parliament for his prospective nomination.  For my part and that of my Government, we would like to see his early confirmation as President of the Commission.

He made the point with regard to voting "Yes" to a Lisbon treaty "we have all signed up to" as it was put.  Does he accept we have not done so?  The Irish people have not signed up to it, although as the transcript will show, that is what he claimed.The Taoiseach also stated that if the people vote "No" a second time to the treaty of Lisbon, there will be no treaty of Lisbon.  We always believed we were equal members of the European Union and voting "No" once should have been adequate.  Why is it that we in Ireland have to vote "No" twice — it also voted twice on the Nice treaty — for the Lisbon treaty, if that is the result to be, whereas for France and the Dutch once is sufficient, in order to revisit the actual texts, full stops and commas?  Why are we different?  Why is our membership not of equal status?The first point I had asked the Taoiseach to consider in regard to voting "No" did not mean that we were going to face a situation of being pushed out of the European Union yet, while the Taoiseach in part acknowledged that in the course of his contribution, he went on to describe our situation post a second "No" to Lisbon as "half in and half out".  That type of language only feeds the point I was trying to scotch from the outset.  We are full members of the European Union and irrespective of how the Irish people decide on the Lisbon treaty a second time, we will remain full members of the European Union, not half in or half out.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	123	One of the reasons I secured a protocol was to make sure we would not be having an argument about all this.The point I am making to the Deputy is an important one.  Our colleagues in the European Union want Ireland as part of the Union — they want us in and they want us to be part of a consensus.  We helped to build the consensus.  The Irish people rejected the Lisbon treaty and it is respected — the treaty cannot come into force unless the Irish people vote "Yes".  The treaty is not in force today given the stated intention of the Irish people thus far and it will not come into force unless the Irish people vote "Yes".  Therefore, the Irish people's view is respected.The issue for the European Union is that this consensus position has been built up over many years.  It is about making the Union more effective and ensuring that the Single Market is more effective, which helps us.  We are all entitled, as democrats, to go back to the people on any issue.  This is being done on the basis of providing the clarifications and confirmations that they required in respect of the concerns they expressed, as best as could be gauged from a very detailed analysis that was undertaken, and to which all parties here contributed, in an effort to synthesise, crystallise and bring forward a rationale and a comprehensive response in respect of issues about which clarifications were needed.  There were certain views and people voted in certain ways because of what they believed.  They were informed by people who campaigned and who, in their enthusiasm to have it defeated, over-egged the omelette.  If there are people on the "Yes" side who do the same, they do not do a service to the people either.I am being very clear and fair about it.  I am saying that on the balance of convenience, on the balance of advantage and on the intrinsic and objective evidence that is before us, and also given the consensus it represents in Europe, the political significance that has been attached to it and the institutional reforms it will bring, which will bring more speedy decision-making that will be to our benefit in the long term, as has been our experience for the past 35 years, I do not believe a cogent argument can be articulated or presented that suggests it is in our interests as a people — not on the basis of other people's views but in our interests as a people — to vote down this treaty a second time.  I honestly do not believe that to be the case.  I am convinced of it.For those who voted "No" in respect of those issues upon which clarification has now been provided — with a legal, full treaty status as is ascribed to other provisions — I hope it will be helpful to them to at least recognise that in coming to this issue again, it will be open for them to change their view, without being dismissive of the view they held before but out of respect for that view.  It is out of respect for it that we went to the European Council, with the help of everybody in this House, so we could ensure the people were not under a misapprehension and there was not a misrepresentation of our position at the European Council in respect of those issues.Those issues include neutrality, to respond to Deputy Finian McGrath, on which the proper legal interpretation of the treaty is outlined quite clearly for us.  That position, let it be said, has been consistently respected by successive treaties of the Union, which refer to the specific character of military neutrality of member states.  Some member states which in the past were part of that grouping are moving; for example, Finland is evolving its position in this respect, and this is also respected.It is a question of diversity in Europe being respected.  It is a question of where our economic and political interests lie, and where we can best guarantee and secure the future of our children, which is already under severe pressure with the problems we are facing.  Do we really want to compound them further?  Do we really want to send that message to the investment community across the world which has come here and created jobs, wealth and opportunities and say, "No, we have some reservations about this project and it is something to which we cannot enthusiastically subscribe"?  That is the message sent by a "No" vote.  It is not a cost free vote or a question of voting "No" and returning to discuss it another time.These are major politically significant events.  Bringing a treaty a second time is out of respect for the decision made before but it is also out of respect for the interests of the country that we put it to the democratic test again.  Of course the people are sovereign and they will be sovereign on this issue too.  However, we have an obligation to put the treaty again out of respect for our people and the interests we believe are involved.

Dairy farmers currently sell milk for seven cent per litre, less than it costs to produce, which is a part of the overall difficulty faced by the sector due to the Government's mismanagement.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I do not agree.  We are putting through approximately €45 billion in 45 minutes.  This represents €1 billion per minute and ten minutes speaking time for each party.  I realise this was discussed or referred to in committee.  In his response to the matter of Crumlin hospital this morning, the Taoiseach made the valid point, which I accept, that we should discuss matters of efficiency and so on here.  The Estimate for the Department of Health and Children is €11.632 billion.  The Taoiseach made a comment about increased service in Galway in the cancer area, which I accept.  In some cases there, patients are being driven from the front door of the hospital to the back door by taxi for additional treatment.Let us consider the Estimate of €10.917 billion allocated to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The best answer to matters of social welfare is to create employment.  Last night the Taoiseach held discussions on social partnership dealing with subsidies for employers, which does not go far enough in the context of the €11 billion stimulus that the Fine Gael Party proposed for job protection and creation.  We should discuss these matters.I refer to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for which there is a €1.599 billion Estimate to deal with expenses, salaries of the office of the Minister but also costs associated with the Irish Land Commission, which was abolished many years ago.  I am unsure of the role of the remnants of the organisation now.  The allocation for the Garda Síochána includes a €1.48 billion payment for certain witnesses expenses and payment of grants-in-aid.  We should discuss these matters in the House and I do not believe it is appropriate to allow 45 minutes for a discussion when almost €45 billion, or €1 billion per minute, is being put through, which is phenomenal.  For this reason I object to the allocation of time.  It is not sufficient and in the interests of that to which the Taoiseach referred, there are opportunities for the House to suggest areas in which money could be saved and to point out where efficiencies could take place.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The purpose of the committee system is to enable a detailed examination of all these issues away from the plenary proceedings of the House, during which legislation and other issues are dealt with and major debates take place.  The use of the committee system has enabled all of these votes to be scrutinised.  Parties can hold a view on procedures and processes and revert to plenary session to confirm the adoption of estimates and to provide for general points to be made.  The detail, remit and efficacy of the spend on all Estimates has been examined thoroughly on an all-party basis.  Rigorous questioning of Ministers has taken place.  I recognise people hold views on how to reform systems and so on but to suggest we only allocated 45 minutes to such a level of expenditure is not an accurate reflection of the work that has been done at committee.

This Bill will be introduced late in the afternoon and is to be guillotined at 6 p.m.  Apart from objecting to the guillotine, a totally new section has been introduced into the Bill which amends the Mental Health Act 2001.  This new section has nothing to do with the rest of the Bill.  It deals with the removal of persons to authorised centres and with authorising people other than staff of a centre to remove persons.Human rights issues may attach to this measure.  The date of these amendments is yesterday and we are expected to deal with them in a guillotined fashion.  We may not even reach this section, the content of which is totally different from the rest of the Bill.  We object to the guillotine.

As has been already indicated by Deputy O'Sullivan, the legislation contains a new element which warrants independent address.  The idea of a guillotine applying to this legislation is unacceptable, as is the series of guillotines which have been applied to legislation as a matter of course in recent weeks.  We ask the Taoiseach to lift the guillotine to allow the House to debate properly all of the content of the Bill now presenting.

The amendment will provide that the registered proprietor may enter into a contract for the purpose of arranging externally assisted admissions.  Persons who are employed by the external agency will be then authorised in writing by the clinical director to provide assisted admissions to his or her approved centre.This issue arose as a result of judicial review proceedings as to what constitutes "staff of the approved centre".  The issue needs to be resolved.

Does the Taoiseach intend to deal with that by way of legislation?I am not sure if the Taoiseach has had time to turn his thoughts to other electoral contests but has he given consideration to the possibility of holding the Donegal South-West by-election on the referendum date in October?  I see the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, does not want that.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	158	Last Thursday on the Order of Business I raised the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 and the time that would be allocated to it in the House this week.  At that stage the draft schedule for this week's business was in place and the Bill was due to be debated this evening and tomorrow.  However, the final schedule allocates four hours for debate before the guillotine comes down.  There are 149 proposed amendments to the Bill to be discussed over four hours.  By my reckoning, that means one amendment to be read, debated and voted on in one minute and 20 seconds.  I have heard of "speed dating" but not of "speed debating", which will happen in this House tomorrow afternoon according to this schedule.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	159	The Deputy has heard about it now.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	161	This Bill has being doing the rounds of the Houses for more than a year.  Significant provisions have been inserted into it in the last week or two, so four hours for debate is not sufficient given the intent of the Bill and the direction it will give to the housing sector in future years.Does the Government intend to bring legislation forward to deal with the protection of deposits paid by home buyers?  This relates to a story in The Irish Times this morning which reports that Laragan Development Ltd. has gone broke and left 100 depositors high and dry.  Anglo Irish Bank is one of the stakeholders in this development for €3.5 million, so the State, as the new owner of Anglo Irish Bank, also has a stakeholding.

Would it not be appropriate to introduce it and air the issue in the House?  It is a matter that resonates with many people, particularly the criminal fraternity.On a different matter, is it intended to deal with the legislation to ensure good governance of property management companies and to provide for the resolution of disputes arising in this area before the end of this session?

I do not know whether the Taoiseach is aware that the European Commission has found Ireland is not compliant with the directive relating to energy security.  We are compliant in the sense that we allow for 90 days of oil stocks but because we are facilitating the stocks we use as collateral we are in contravention of the EU directive.  If we do not do something about this we will end up in the courts.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I made the general point that if we are to have a debate on these issues we should at least have some consistency of approach.  We all recognise that budgets are finite and we need to find more efficiencies.  Despite the reduction in budget of 3% this year over last year, activity levels and service plan levels are higher this year.  This indicates that——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	194	——with co-operation between everybody involved, the clinical leadership that can be provided, and the new reforms regarding how a clinical director will pull together all the activities in the hospital, these practices can be improved.  The HSE has sought to discover which scoliosis procedures can be completed between now and the end of the year.  It is better for the House to address the wider policy issue, namely, to ensure that paediatrics are brought together, in this city and on a national basis, and that we get the best output for the very considerable resources we are providing.  The sum this year is over €250 million.

Nach bhfuil sé in am é a thógáil ar ais ar an liosta gearr-thréimhseach ionnas go mbeidh seans ag Údarás na Gaeltachta cabhair a thabhairt do Foinse toisc go bhfuil an nuachtán ar tí dúnadh?Second, I understand that after completion of the substantial Broadcasting Act, the Minister has power to make directions in respect of protection of diversity.  Given the collapse of the right of Irish people to enjoy sport, and the near-monopoly conditions emerging in sporting rights and their allocation, what is the status of those ministerial orders which the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is entitled to make in order to protect diversity and the right of free-to-air broadcasting?My first question dealt with the disappearance of the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act.  It was there for years as a kind of ghost.  Nobody knew why it was there.  It was an up-the-airy-mountain kind of legislation. Foinse is now on the point of closing.  Now is the time, if the Údarás were interested in extending its remit into publication, to ensure at least a newspaper in the Irish language.My other question is much more serious.  I was in a minority in this House in holding the view there was a danger, when Mr. Murdoch said he would use sporting rights as the battering ram to achieve monopoly in broadcasting.  I was assured there was no danger.  I understand there is a capacity in the Act which has just been passed for the Minister to act to protect the right of the Irish people to have a certain amount of free-to-air access to sporting events, in order to prevent monopoly.  I understand that is also in compliance with European thinking.  Do we just sit back and let the monopoly roll over us?  Is that the broadcasting policy?

Ní bheidh sin furasta ach beidh mé féin ag fíosrú, le fáil amach cad é is féidir linn a dhéanamh chun cabhair a thabhairt.Regarding the Broadcasting Act, I am not aware of the specifics the Deputy raised.  He had a ministerial responsibility in this area in the past.  I recall when Deputy Dermot Ahern was the relevant Minister that an effort was made at the time to retain the right to broadcast events of national importance.

It is a serious issue and there was unanimity on both sides.  This is not a contentious matter.

As the Deputy knows, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Andrews, has been given the task, on behalf of the Government, of coming forward with the response of Government to the detailed recommendations in the Ryan report.  The separate issue regarding the moral obligation on congregations to come forward further to meet the responsibilities is an ongoing matter, one that I have outlined by way of statement.  A clear, unanimous motion of the House informs that debate.  While today may not be a deadline, I expect progress to be made on the issue.

Based on the full information being provided to us, we can make an assessment as to where we will go from here with regard to it.  The overall objective has been clear, transparent and unanimous in the House.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	226	Will the House have a chance to debate it?

Will he confirm that the final day will be given over to such a debate, as was always normal practice?

At the time of the last budget, it was announced that the National Consumer Agency, NCA, and the Competition Authority were to merge in a marriage of quangos.  Last weekend, the Minister for Finance indicated that the consumer side of the regulator's office, the one investigating matters such as bank overcharging and that is regarded as being one of the regulator's better sides, if there are any, will be included in the NCA.  This seems strange.  The Taoiseach had some pithy comments about the performance of the NCA.

Approximately ten years ago, it was discovered that the National Irish Bank was stealing money from customers' accounts on a wholesale basis.  The theft was identified in internal audit reports and was the subject of a journalistic investigation in which my colleague, Charlie Bird, and I were involved.  In the course of the investigation, it became clear that there were major holes in respect of financial and consumer regulation in the banking sector.  Where a bank was stealing money in that way, protecting people proved difficult.The protection of consumers was one of the core reasons for the establishment of the consumer element of the new regulator.  Until that point, all that obtained in terms of financial regulation was prudential regulation.  In a sense, the Central Bank saw it as its job to ensure that, in prudential regulation, banks were profitable so that the system——

#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	302	My question is on the consumer and competition Bill, which will amalgamate the consumer agency and the Competition Authority, and the financial services regulation Bill, which will modernise financial services legislation in accordance with the new situation.  To what extent or how can consumers be protected by the legislation from banks that want to steal money in the fashion outlined?

Discussion can take place on Second Stage, including I am sure a contribution from the Deputy, as to the adequacy of the new arrangements and how it has been able to protect consumer interests.  The Financial Regulator had a remit and built up a reasonably good reputation in that area in terms of consumer protection.

A serious change must take place.  There is no question but lessons must be learnt.  The Financial Services Ombudsman has also been an effective advocate for consumer rights in this area.  He has had sufficient statutory powers not only to make a recommendation but to obtain settlements in favour of those who were wrongly treated by financial institutions.  He has been successful in that effort.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I wish to dissociate myself from the remarks made by Deputy Creighton on the Order of Business.I attended the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, 18 and 19 June.  I was accompanied at the meeting by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, and the Attorney General were also part of the delegation.The Council was among the most important for Ireland in recent years.  As the House will be aware, the focus of our efforts was the guarantees on the Lisbon treaty and, in particular, on ensuring that both their content and form were satisfactory.  That will also be the main focus of my statement to the House today but, first, I wish to cover the other important business of the Council.Much of the discussion in the formal session centred on the fall-out from the international economic and financial crisis.  Follow up to the De Larosière report on financial supervision was a key issue, and there was considerable debate on the degree to which the proposed new system of financial supervisory authorities should have binding mediation or decision making power.  This is an important area and Ireland has been supportive of the Commission's proposals in ECOFIN.  In particular, we believe it important that there is clarity about where responsibility lies, so as to minimise risk of any repeat of recent failures.  Ultimately, the Council agreed that the European system of financial supervisors be established to improve the quality and consistency of national supervision and to increase oversight of cross-border groups, which are the norm in today's financial world.  The reality is that we need far better cross-border regulation and Ireland is strongly supportive of the steps taken last week.The Council agreed to the creation of a European systemic risk board and that its chair would be elected by the General Council of the European Central Bank.  The summit clears the way for the Commission to bring forward legislative proposals so that the new arrangements can be put in place as soon as possible.  I expect October's Council to return to this issue because of its importance and urgency.The Council also adopted conclusions on strengthening efforts to support employment and welcomed the Commission's plans to develop concrete actions in the three priority areas of maintaining and creating jobs, improving skills and increasing access to employment.  The Council also noted the important stabilising role and cushioning effect of social protection systems and social inclusion policies.During the discussion of the economic and financial situation, a number of delegations raised the current situation in the milk market.  I emphasised the importance of the sector and the need to address the low price currently being achieved by producers, which is not sustainable.  The Council took up the issue and the Commission was asked to present an in-depth market analysis of the current market situation, within the next two months, including possible options for stabilising the dairy market.  This effort will respect the outcome of the CAP health check with which Ireland was pleased.  While the topic was not on the scheduled business of the Council, the response of the Council again highlights how responsive Europe can be and is to real issues.The Council also discussed climate change.  We agreed that the Presidency and Commission would produce a work programme to ensure the necessary internal EU co-ordination arrangements are in place to consider how to share the burden of helping developing countries adapt and-or mitigate their climate change impact.  It is essential that we reach a comprehensive and effective agreement at UN level, which I hope will happen later this year in Copenhagen.  The European Union has provided leadership to the world on this issue with our unilateral commitment to cut emissions by 20%.  Others will also have to make their contribution.  I am pleased to see that this is now commencing, particularly with positive signals from the new US Administration under President Obama.  I made the point in my press conference after the Council that the need to act on climate change increases with the passage of time.  The next six months are extremely important for us all and I look forward to the Swedish Presidency taking this work forward.  We agreed to come back to this issue in October and to take whatever decisions are required at that point to ensure we maximise the prospects for a deal at Copenhagen.There was also discussion on illegal immigration from outside the European Union.  As the House will know, there is a particularly difficult situation in the Mediterranean area, notably in Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Malta.There was considerable interest in the appointment of the President of the Commission.  President Barroso presented his candidature and vision for Europe, and the members of the European Council were unanimous in agreeing to nominate him.  The Presidency will now hold discussions with the European Parliament to determine whether the Parliament is in a position to give its approval to the appointment in July.  It is in the interests of the Union to have this matter finalised as quickly as possible, in order to eliminate uncertainty about who will lead the next Commission at this time of great international challenge.  I have already indicated publicly my view that President Barroso has been an excellent President of the Commission.  He enjoys the support of the members of the European Council and confirmation of his appointment in the coming weeks would be a positive message of stability at the helm of the next Commission.I turn now to the issue which dominated the Council for Ireland, namely the Lisbon treaty.  Almost exactly one year ago, I made a statement to this House after a European Council meeting at which the main talking point was the rejection of the Lisbon treaty by Ireland days earlier.  I reported then that the Council had been very concerned, and had highlighted the dilemma of trying to respond to the concerns of the Irish people while still trying to advance a process which they consider to be vital.  I reported that they were perplexed by the impression they had that issues not related to the treaty had greatly influenced our debate.  At that time, I informed the House of how I had said frankly to my counterparts on the Council that the result had to be respected.  We would have to take the time necessary to understand why the treaty had been rejected.  We would have to examine why the debate had often portrayed Europe as being more concerned with treaties, directives and regulations than with making a meaningful and beneficial impact on the lives of people in Europe.Six months later, in my statement to the House following December's Council meeting, I reported how we had conducted extensive research and identified the key concerns of the Irish people that would need to be addressed if we were to revisit ratification of the treaty.  I referred to the value of the work of the all-party committee in that respect.  I also reported that, in response, the Council had agreed that Ireland should receive legal guarantees on specific concerns, that the importance of workers rights and social progress would be confirmed and that, if the Lisbon treaty entered into force, each member state would retain a Commissioner.I am very pleased to say to the House today that last week, the European Council agreed a package of legally-binding guarantees that respond comprehensively to the concerns of the Irish people.  We already had agreement that if the Lisbon treaty enters force, each member state will keep its Commissioner.  That commitment was confirmed again in last week's conclusions.  On Friday, the European Council also agreed on a set of legally-binding guarantees for Ireland, in the form of a decision of the heads of State and Government.  The Council further agreed that the contents of this decision will also be incorporated in a protocol to be attached to the EU treaties after the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.  The guarantees make clear beyond doubt that Ireland retains control of its own tax rates, that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is unaffected by the treaty and the protections in the Constitution on the right to life, education and the family are not in any way affected by the Lisbon treaty.The Council also adopted a solemn declaration making clear the importance of workers' rights and public services to the Union.  I hope that this solemn declaration will help to deal with some confusion which appears to exist on the Lisbon treaty and workers' rights.  The treaty represents a positive step forward on a variety of fronts, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the horizontal social clause.  We should bear in mind that very much of the progress over the past decades regarding Irish workers' rights and legislation has been inspired by the experience of our partners and has been delivered through the mechanisms of EU laws.  Some might wish the Lisbon treaty would deliver more in this area but that cannot negate the positive measures it would bring about for workers.We are all aware of how the economic context has changed so dramatically since one year ago.  The crisis we have witnessed on the financial and economic fronts is largely without precedent.  The public finances are under pressure and we have seen, sadly, the return of substantial unemployment, which brings with it frustration, demoralisation and the loss of human potential.The Lisbon treaty is important in the context of our economic recovery.  Its ratification would remove the considerable doubt in the minds of business people at home and abroad about our commitment to Europe.  That doubt is the last thing we need at a time when, more than ever, we want to create, protect and sustain jobs.  We need to help ourselves if we are to retain existing investment and attract new investment, and if we are to keep existing jobs and attract new jobs.  Using the treaty as leverage to pursue other goals is a dangerous game that puts jobs at risk.  This would do no service to workers or their families, never mind workers' rights.Our country faces several challenges.  We must bridge the budget deficit and get cash flowing again adequately in the economy.  We must restore economic activity to minimise the scourge of unemployment.  To do all that, we must remove the doubt about where our country stands in relation to Europe.  This issue transcends party boundaries.  I welcome the supportive comments of the leaders of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and other Members of this House following the important agreement reached in Brussels last week.Ireland needs Europe and we need a Europe that works.  However, it must work for Germany, Slovenia and Finland as much as it works for us.  The agreed means of achieving this is the Lisbon treaty.With regard to those who point to this or that imperfection, I do not dispute the European Union might not be perfect.  However, I am firmly of the view it is hugely positive for Ireland and that, without doubt, it is the greatest example across the world of international co-operation for the common good.  For any set of rules to be acceptable to 27 sovereign states, there will always be compromises.  However, focusing on specific issues, important though they may seem, while missing the big picture that this treaty is fundamentally about our working relationship with our European partners risks not seeing the wood for the trees.  The European Union is the means by which we make a meaningful impact on the wider world in which we exist.  The Lisbon treaty is designed to equip Europe for an unpredictable future.  Now, more than ever, we need an effective Europe.Since last June, our overriding objective has been to address the concerns expressed by the people in last year's referendum and to ensure we continue to pursue our interests effectively within the European Union.  We have got the response we wanted.  Based on that response, the Government is satisfied that we should now return to the Irish people and ask them again to approve Ireland's ratification of the treaty.  The relevant legislation is being finalised and will be introduced to the Oireachtas very shortly.  This legislation will set out the proposed constitutional amendment to be put to the people for adoption if they agree to ratify the Lisbon treaty.  Once the legislation has been passed, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be in a position to make an order formally setting the date for the referendum, which the Government believes should be in early October.This referendum represents a hugely important juncture for this country.  It is perhaps one of the greatest national issues to face us in very many years.  Therefore, it should be the sole focus of our effort and attention on this occasion.  We are, fundamentally, faced with a decision about how we regard our place in the European Union.  Nobody should underestimate the importance or scale of this challenge for our country.It is imperative that all of us who believe in Ireland's place at the heart of Europe and the benefits that accrue to Ireland from our EU membership wage a united campaign to secure a resounding endorsement of the Lisbon treaty and of Ireland's commitment to the European Union, a union that is the platform for much of our prosperity and essential to the viability of so many Irish jobs.It is not my intention to engage in anything other than a strong, positive campaign, working with those who share my view that a "Yes" vote is vital to this country's interests, to demonstrate that the concerns of the Irish people have been addressed, to promote the significant positive features of the Lisbon treaty and, above all, to ensure Ireland both contributes to and benefits from the spirit of solidarity that is a defining feature of the European Union.

This country was always an information society.  For 2,000 years we sent educators and missionaries all over Europe.  The Irish, by the their nature, are a curious people.  They are inquisitive and like to know the scale of problems and difficulties.  Ireland has never rejected the European Union and I do not believe its electorate wants to do so now either.  The reason the Irish did not support the Lisbon treaty on the last occasion was because of confusion and the inability of the political process to make them feel part of the European scene, make them want to approve the treaty because of what it means rather than reject it because of what it does not contain.Ireland, with its population of 4.2 million, is part of a Union of 500 million.  It is ironic that the eyes of Europe and the world now focus on Ireland.  Bearing in mind the strength of the United States, India, China and emerging and burgeoning economies in the Far East, it is important to reflect on the assessed wisdom of international financial commentators to the effect that, in the next 20 years, the big economies will include Japan, India, China, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and the United States while Europe will be trailing behind.  To keep services moving with an ageing population, the Union will have to have a clear immigration policy.  At the many meetings I attended in Brussels, it was said we need a Union response because no country could deal with the phenomenon on its own given its scale.  Prime Minister Gonzi of Malta said to me last week there are now thousands of illegal immigrants in his country.  The scale is such that the number would be the equivalent of 500,000 in Germany.There is an opportunity for a brilliant future for Ireland and we must take domestic action.  There are difficulties, and differences of opinion arise between the Government and Opposition over the Government's handing of the financial crisis we face, but that is a matter of politics.  The Fine Gael Party will campaign very strongly in support of the Lisbon treaty and in support of making people want to feel part of it and fully happy with it in the knowledge that voting "Yes" is to the benefit of themselves, their families, the nation and the European Union as a whole.I welcome the support of the Taoiseach for the reappointment of José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission.  This appointment could be dealt with sooner rather than later.  People expected that, once the European elections were over, the politicians would make such appointments.  It is not feasible to leave the Commission headless until the late autumn.  The matter should be dealt with sooner rather than later.  While the European People's Party does not have an overall majority in the European Parliament, it is a matter for negotiation between it and the socialist or liberal groups to form a majority such that President Barroso can be appointed.  In many ways he has been the face of Europe in recent years.  He was active, energetic, attended events where appropriate, both within and without the Union, and did a first-class job for the Union.While the Taoiseach, as leader of his party, is affiliated to a different group in the European Parliament from Fine Gael, I welcome his support.  I hope the Government will examine the question of the audit of some of the directives that have been transposed.  It is a sore matter and can be dealt with.Perhaps when the Minister or Minister of State is responding, he might deal with the possible options for stabilising the dairy industry.  It is of serious import in Ireland and is obviously a cause of considerable concern, particularly to those involved in the commercial dairy sector.  This is of serious import here and is a cause of massive concern to those involved in the commercial dairy sector.

I welcome the fact that it was raised at the General Council meeting.  Our party leader, Deputy Kenny, has taken it up with his EU colleagues.  One of the issues mentioned at the Council was the creation of a friendly environment for employment.  We are not good at this because we have many rules and regulations, whether in respect of planning or enforcement of regulations introduced during the Celtic tiger era which are inappropriate to the current climate.  We must reconsider these regulations.  Local authorities make it difficult for businesses to attract tourists, even from the point of view of erecting signs.  These are small issues that can create a great deal of difficulty.It is important to realise that the European Union has been a great source of employment.  Since the Single European Act in 1992, over 2.5 million extra jobs were created in the Union.  From 2004 until the current difficulties arose, employment increased in the old countries by 1.5% and in the new countries by 1%.  The European Union has been a great source of employment as have the global market and the open economy.  Despite our recent difficulties we should not shy away from this in future.  It is important to have standardised financial regulation.  I look forward to the recommendations of the de la Rosière report being implemented.  If the EU could encourage the United States to implement a similar set of regulations, it would give rise to greater global stability in the financial markets.Deputy Kenny mentioned the dairy farmers.  It was sad to see farmers protesting because they do not have a strike mechanism but that brought home to me how difficult it was to understand why the agricultural community sat on the fence during the Lisbon treaty campaign last year because our agricultural community cannot survive without membership of the European Union.  I hope that the leadership of that community will campaign for a "Yes" vote to the treaty.  This involves more than adopting the Lisbon treaty; it involves keeping Ireland at the heart of Europe.  It is important to articulate the many positive aspects of being involved in Europe instead of getting bogged down in the nonsensical arguments of the "No" camp which says nothing has changed.  Much has changed in the rhetoric they used a year ago.It is important for us to take a proactive role in the Middle East peace process.  Many of the things happening in Israel are unacceptable.  Yesterday, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs met the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign.  While many of its criticisms of Israel were justified, it could not give a view on Hamas when asked to do so.  Anyone who debates this issue should come with clean hands and outline their position.  I welcome the developments outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this area, but regret that members of his party put down a divisive motion at the committee as a result of which we invite groups arguing for one side.  Equity cannot be sought without clean hands; otherwise, one cannot be part of creating a solution.It is important to have lines of communication with Iran.  It is too easy for us to see the riots on our television screens and not to understand the real problems.  Isolation will not solve the problem.  Iran's military capability is limited.  It uses leverage on Hamas, Hizbollah and al-Qaeda but we must neutralise that extremism in Iran.I also welcome the Council decision to seek the release and condemn the mock trial of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.  I notice the Council's welcome for the closure of Guantanamo Bay.  Has Ireland been asked to take any of the refugees from there?  Where do we and Europe stand on that issue?  What are the implications for us of taking someone?The horizontal social clause which in effect means that every policy decision taken at EU level must consider the social implications is welcome.  We would have very few rights for workers if they had not been initiated in the European Union.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I thank the Taoiseach for his presentation.  He mentioned ambitious climate change targets for the Copenhagen meeting at the end of the year.  Public debate has recently raised certain questions about this following the global and European economic crisis.  I am not sure that there is the same level of commitment across the European Union to delivering on these targets as previously.  There is a fear that we may compromise competitiveness and opportunities in the global market and job creation to achieve the targets.  We must address this because the green economy offers a great opportunity for job creation.  There is an onus on us to communicate that to the public and I hope the Government will take this up with gusto before the Copenhagen meeting.I commend the work of the Government in achieving the guarantees in the Lisbon treaty.  We have all participated in this over the past 12 months through the work of the Oireachtas Sub-committee on the Future of Europe and Deputy Kenny's commitment to achieving those guarantees to assuage the fears people had during the last referendum campaign.  While it was expected that we would achieve legal guarantees, not everyone was confident that we would achieve a commitment to the protocols.  That will make our job much easier.  I am glad that agreement has been achieved.  Well done to the Taoiseach and his officials on achieving that commitment.The key issues in the last Lisbon referendum campaign, workers' rights, concerns about neutrality and defence, some a bit fallacious, some legitimate, and concerns about taxation, have been put to bed.  People who are genuinely concerned and opposed the treaty on the last occasion are coming around and believe that there is something in it for them.  They feel that some of their fears have been allayed which is positive.I urge the Government to avoid getting into a wrangling match with the "No" campaigners about falsehoods and misleading arguments because we risk falling into that trap.  We must focus on what Lisbon will do for Ireland and Europe because it has so many benefits.  It is not the most exciting treaty because it does not have any major issue on which we can hang our hats, but there is a multitude of reasons that it is so important.  It will enable the European Parliament, Commission and Council to deliver for the people of Europe.  It will make Europe more transparent.  People think that Council meetings happen behind closed doors, that a great deal of diplomacy goes on and nobody knows what is happening, or why, or how it benefits them.Under the terms of the Lisbon treaty the meetings will be open.  We need to lay emphasis on this because in the past the naysayers completely erroneously claimed that the Lisbon treaty will make the EU less accountable when the opposite is the case; it will make the European Union more accountable and more responsive to their needs as was outlined by Deputy Kenny.  It is crucial that we highlight the fact that the Lisbon treaty will make Europe more powerful and influential on the world stage and if we are to achieve our goals on climate change, energy security and economic recovery we must ensure that it is passed.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I wish to share my time with Deputy Costello.On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the outcome of the European Council regarding the impact of the Lisbon treaty on Ireland and on the Irish Constitution.  The Labour Party supported the Lisbon treaty last year.  We believed then and we believe now that the Lisbon treaty makes the European Union more democratic, more effective in dealing with urgent international problems such as the financial crisis and climate change and, crucially, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights directs the EU towards a progressive, human rights-based, social Europe that will benefit all of our citizens.As a result, we were disappointed when the treaty was rejected in the referendum last year.  However, democracy is a two-way conversation.  It is as much about listening as it is about speaking and it was extremely important to listen to the concerns expressed by our citizens about the Lisbon treaty.  This was facilitated by representations to the Oireachtas committee on the treaty and significant research into the reasons voters chose to reject the treaty.Having listened to those concerns, the other member states have responded by guaranteeing that if the Lisbon treaty is ratified, every member state will nominate a commissioner to the European Commission and that the treaty will not supersede the Irish Constitution on the right to life, the family, education, taxation or defence.  The Labour Party was clear that the European Union has no jurisdiction over such issues as abortion, family life, taxation policy or Irish neutrality, and that the Lisbon treaty did not change this fact.  However, the clear and unambiguous agreement by all other 26 member states that the Lisbon treaty does not, and cannot, affect these aspects of Irish domestic policy is to be welcomed.The declaration on workers' rights and social policy, as made by the European Council, represents a unanimous agreement on how the Lisbon treaty impacts workers' rights and public services.  The Lisbon treaty will have a very positive impact in these areas.  The Lisbon treaty, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights that is part of it, further integrate the economic and the social aspects of European Union membership so that they complement each other more effectively and so that a better balance is struck between the demands of the market and the needs of society.Much of the argument on the last Lisbon referendum was taken up with issues that were not actually affected by the treaty.  One false argument, which was repeatedly asserted, was that somehow the Lisbon treaty would worsen the rights of workers in the EU.  What seemed to get lost in the debates was that the Lisbon treaty does change workers' rights but for the better.  It is worth recalling the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which include: the right of workers to information and consultation in their place of work; the right to collective bargaining and action; protection against unfair dismissal; the right to fair and just working conditions; and a prohibition on the exploitation of younger workers.If the Lisbon treaty is passed, all future European Union legislation will have to have regard to these fundamental rights.  The concerns about workers' rights, which came to the fore during the Lisbon referendum campaign last summer, largely arose because of a failure to adequately address workers' rights at home, not in Brussels.  There are at least eight commitments on employment rights, made in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and in the subsequent transitional document, which are yet to be passed into law.  These include the temporary agency workers directive, which was agreed over one year ago, but which the Tánaiste informs us will take a further two years to pass into law despite the fact that this vacuum in Irish law has already given rise to the exploitation of Irish and EU workers.Also included are the following: the Employment Law Compliance Bill (2008), which provides for statutory supervision of the workplace, and which was supposed to be enacted by the end of last year; the Industrial Relations Bill, which is intended to shore up the rights of those employed in the hotel, catering and construction industries; and the Employment Agency Regulation Bill.  The list also includes anti-victimisation legislation, which is to protect those workers who choose to join a trade union, and which was promised for March 2009 and legislation to address employee representation at work, which was supposed to be enacted by June 2009, but which has not even been published.Also included are the amendment of section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 to exempt freelance journalists, session musicians and voice-over actors and the transposition of the optional pensions provisions on the transfer of undertakings directive into Irish law.  Furthermore, if the Government is serious about addressing concerns over workers' rights, it can re-visit the posting of workers directive to ensure that the existing rights of workers in Ireland cannot be undermined.There can be no ambiguity about where the Irish State stands when it comes to workers' rights.  It must be clear that if the Lisbon treaty is ratified by the Irish people, the workers' rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be enshrined in domestic legislation.  I call on the Government to demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to strong and fair employment rights by enacting the outstanding legislation promised under Towards 2016.  Where possible, this legislation should be in place, or at least published, before the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.If this Administration fails to do so, then if returned to government the Labour Party will do the following: as a matter of priority legislate to protect the rights of temporary agency workers; ensure that the posting of workers directive does not undermine existing workers' rights in Ireland; legislate for the statutory supervision of workplaces; ensure the legal right to adequate representation of employees in their place of work; make it illegal to discriminate against an employee because he or she is a member of a trade union; and pass the Industrial Relations Bill to protect vulnerable workers in the hotel, catering and construction industries.The Labour Party in government will also commit to giving domestic effect to the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  If the Lisbon treaty is passed and following consultation with the social partners, the Labour Party in government will legislate for the right to information and consultation within the workplace, the right to collective bargaining and action and the right to fair and just working conditions.Just as strong and fair workers' rights are an integral part of a stronger social Europe, so too are public services.  The Lisbon treaty provides, for the first time, a legal basis to distinguish between public services that are not suitable for competition, and other services of general economic interest.  This is to protect public services, not to undermine them.  Furthermore, Article 9 of the Lisbon treaty specifically states:In defining and implementing its policies and actions, the Union shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health.The solemn declaration reiterating the rights of member states to "provide, commission and organise non-economic services of general interest", or public services, is simply a statement of fact that public services are not threatened by the ratification of the Lisbon treaty.There is no question but that the past 12 months have been extremely damaging for Ireland's image internationally.  Ireland needs to restore international confidence and its reputation.  We need to make it clear that we are fully engaged in the EU and not semi-detached from it.  It is not enough to protest that Irish voters are pro-European Union.  We have to demonstrate that we are willing to take responsibility for our membership.  That means sharing the responsibility for the European Union's future.  We cannot do that from a semi-detached position.This is not an issue of international public relations or diplomacy; it is about investment and jobs.  We cannot ignore the reality of how our country is being portrayed in the international press, and the effect that has on those who make critical decisions about jobs and about lending money to our banks.  We need to make it clear that Ireland is open for business and that we welcome inward investment and the jobs that go with it.  The ratification of the Lisbon treaty will send out a clear message that Ireland wants to remain fully engaged with the European Union.At the beginning, I stated that democracy is a two-way conversation.  Last June the people rejected the Lisbon treaty because they were concerned about how it would affect the Irish Constitution and our domestic policy on tax, neutrality and workers' rights.  We now have guarantees that the Lisbon treaty did not, and does not, affect Ireland's ability to provide its public services, decide on ethical issues, preserve its low corporate tax rates or to remain neutral, and that in the case of workers' rights, the Lisbon treaty actually strengthens them.In the autumn, the people will get a chance to respond and to look again at what the Lisbon treaty offers Ireland and what Ireland offers the European Union.  Ireland's position within the European Union must be restored with the ratification of the Lisbon treaty so that we are part of a Union that is good for business, good for workers, and good for our citizens.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing time.The Taoiseach's 30-page Council summary covered a wide range of issues, even though the Lisbon treaty was the main focus.  Nevertheless, a great deal of time was spent on economic and banking issues and there was welcome movement and proposals on the direction of financial regulation in the de Larosière report.  However, less then one page was devoted to employment and not a single new idea was articulated in the conclusions.  Perhaps something arose but it is not covered in the conclusions, which contained a wish list for member states, which have the ultimate responsibility for moving forward and doing the best they can.  I was extremely disappointed with that, especially in the context of the informal summit that took place in Prague the previous month.Under climate change provisions, the 2020 target of 20% was reaffirmed but no detail was provided on how that might be achieved.  Will the Taoiseach indicate how Ireland proposes to get its house in order in the run-up to the Copenhagen conference to meet the target?  While a recession could bridge the gap, it will do so in the wrong direction in terms of greenhouse gas and carbon emissions.The main focus of the European Council from an Irish point of view was to smooth the way for a second referendum and the Government achieved that objective.  We are on course for a referendum in early October.  As my party leader said, it is in the national interest that the Lisbon treaty be ratified by Ireland.  I acknowledge substantial achievements were made at the Council meeting.  A commissioner for each member state has been secured and the guarantees on taxation, defence and socio-ethical issues are legal decisions, while a commitment was made that they would be appended to the next accession treaty, which provides a limited timescale for the protocols to be in place.  That is a firm legal guarantee.The gross misinterpretations and misrepresentations of supporters of the "No" side combined with the genuine confusion which caused many people to vote "No" or not vote at all in the first referendum have been clearly addressed and they should not be allowed to distort the debate, as they did last June.  There is no loss of national control over taxation policy and we can maintain our corporation tax rate and, thus, attract foreign direct investment, which currently creates 75% of all our exports.  It is particularly important to have this reasserted at a time of high unemployment and economic crisis.There is no European Union army and our youth cannot be conscripted into a non-existent army.  As the Taoiseach said, people went door to door in my constituency telling householders that their sons, in particular, would be conscripted into a new army that would be established if the Lisbon treaty came into force.  There will be no interference with Ireland's traditional neutrality.  We are not obliged to join the European Defence Agency or participate in permanent structured co-operation.  We said that at the time but this assertion was never properly refuted.  It remains the prerogative of Ireland and every other member state to determine the nature and volume of their defence and security expenditure and defence capabilities.  Ireland, as always, will only embark on foreign military operations of its choice under the triple-lock procedure.  The Taoiseach has made a commitment that legislation will be processed by the House before it rises on 10 July regarding the European Defence Agency and I presume he will confirm this later.The right to life, protection of the family and education matters provided for under the Constitution are not affected in any way by the treaty's provisions and this is spelled out in detail in the legal guarantees.  During the previous referendum campaign, fundamentalist groups such as Cóir, Youth Defence and the newspaper, Alive!, alleged that the treaty opened the door to abortion and euthanasia in a godless Europe.  Such scaremongering should now be finally put to rest and the mainstream churches should make it clear that fundamentalists do not speak for them.  They did not do this during the first referendum campaign but they should do so this time.The loss of an Irish commissioner was presented in the Lisbon treaty campaign by Sinn Féin and many others in the "No" campaign as though it was a family bereavement.  Not one of them had a good word to say about Mr. Charlie McCreevy, the incumbent Commissioner.  Now that Ireland and every other member state will have a commissioner, there is scarcely a murmur of approval from the "No" side, which had plastered the countryside with posters declaiming the tragic demise of the Irish commissioner, the loss of a seat at the Commission table and the virtual end to democracy as we knew it.The final matter that caused significant concern to domestic voters was the protection of workers' rights.  As Deputy Gilmore outlined in considerable detail, the other 26 member states have agreed a solemn declaration on the issue of workers' rights and social policy.  This is an addition to the protections and commitments in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will be a protocol to the Lisbon treaty when it is, hopefully, passed.  That significantly enhances the protection of workers' rights.  However, it is important that the Government parties in the run-up to the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty demonstrate good faith in this area by making sure the appropriate domestic legislation is put in place and commitments are made, where it cannot be put in place, to show that workers' rights and social policy are of considerable importance to them.I do not know whether the House has time to process this legislation because it must deal with the Bills for the referendum, the referendum commission and the European Defence Agency while the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 is before us.  I also do not know whether we can deal with the agency workers Bill or revisit the posting of workers directive and other legislation identified by Deputy Gilmore.  It is important that the Taoiseach indicates that he intends to make a solemn commitment that the Government parties will address whatever they can before the House rises because we will not have an opportunity to do so in the autumn and, where they cannot do so, that they will make a commitment to do so in the future.  We will do that if we are in government following the next election.

Is féidir féachaint siar ar an tuairisc oifigiúil maidir le seo.Let us be clear about what happened at last week's European Council of Minister's meeting.  For the few weeks running up to the Council meeting, the Government and its supporters in the "Yes" campaign worked hard to create an impression that something very important was about to be secured.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Hence the reference to knowing who your friends are in Europe and the benefits to our economic future by blindly accepting this failed treaty.  We would all be forgiven for thinking we were listening to Fianna Fáil's great champions, Charlie Haughey or Bertie Ahern, as they sold the people out to their developer friends and banking buddies in years gone by, making them cash happy.The most important thing to note from last week's Council of Ministers' discussions in Brussels on the Lisbon treaty is that nothing of substance was achieved.  I agree we have an international "agreement" on neutrality, taxation and ethical issues, to be lodged in the United Nations.  I agree we have a promise of sorts of a protocol on these issues to be attached to a future treaty, probably an accession treaty — possibly on the accession of Croatia or of several countries — on a date yet to be decided.  I agree we even have a solemn declaration on workers' rights.However, has the Government secured any changes to the text of the Lisbon treaty itself?  Will any aspect of the treaty's implementation in Ireland or across the European Union be altered by this international agreement?  Have the genuine and substantive concerns the electorate voiced so articulately in the run-up to the referendum on issues such as Ireland's loss of influence, militarisation and neutrality, workers' rights and public services, international trade agreements, nuclear power and the developing world been addressed?  The honest answer to all of those questions is a resounding "No".

The guarantees are nothing more than a series of clarifications of some aspects of the Lisbon treaty.  The treaty itself has not been changed.  The clarifications have not altered the text, but that is what was sought.  Senior UCD lecturer in law, Gavin Barrett, stated last week in an article in The Irish Times:Normally a treaty requires ratification by member states.  This treaty does not.  This is because it involves the member states offering existing legal guarantees and clarifications only in respect of substantive legal obligations already explicit or implicit in the treaty.Níl athrú déanta ar an téacs.  Mar sin, nuair a thagann muid chun vóta a chaitheamh arís ar chonradh Liospóin, beidh muid ag caitheamh an vóta ar an gconradh ceanann céanna, leis na himpleachtaí ceanann céanna d'Éire agus don Aontas Eorpach.

Ar an 12 Meitheamh 2008 chaith muid vóta agus dúirt muid "Níl", ach anois tá an Rialtas ag cur iachaill ar mhuintir na hÉireann vóta a chaitheamh athuair ar an cheist cheanann chéanna.Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies say the guarantees safeguard Irish neutrality and tax sovereignty and that the solemn declaration received signals the European Union's goal to protect workers' rights.  Ba mhaith liom dul tríd na ceisteanna atá ardaithe agamsa agus ag daoine eile ceann ar ceann.  On neutrality, the decision of the Heads of State, agreed last Friday, states that the Lisbon treaty does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  This tells us that Irish troops can only be sent abroad with the consent of the Government, the Council of Ministers and the Oireachtas.  Sinn Féin never disputed that.  Indeed, the Lisbon treaty is very clear in this regard.However, neutrality is not only about what a country does with its troops.  It is also about the alliances formed and what a country does with its resources and what other member states do in one's country's name.  The Lisbon treaty makes clear its intent when it states there shall be a common defence.  In expanding the scope of permissible military missions it demonstrates its desire to move beyond peacekeeping and civil reconstruction.  In reasserting the compatibility of the European Union foreign and defence policies with those of NATO, it reminds us that the emerging EU common defence is clearly aligned.  Provisions for permanent, structured co-operation create the real possibility that wars we do not support will be fought in our name and with our resources.

Sa trí noiméid fágtha, déanfaidh mé iarracht déileáil le cúpla ceist eile.  Bhí mé ag labhairt faoi the mutual defence clause.  It creates obligations incompatible with any internationally-recognised definition of neutrality.  Anyone in any doubt about the implications of the Lisbon treaty for Irish neutrality should read the exchange of views in the opinion section of The Irish Times sparked by the Dublin City University academic, Dr. Karen Devine.  It was an interesting debate which went back and forth from November to December last yearOn taxation, the Council decision tells us nothing new.  Under the Lisbon treaty any move to a common corporation tax system across Europe would require a unanimous vote at the Council of Ministers.  Anyone who read the treaty could tell one this.  Sinn Féin's concerns on taxation rest with Article 48 of the treaty.  It allows the Council of Ministers, by unanimous decision, to alter the text of existing EU treaties.  Despite the protestations of the Minister, Deputy Martin, he has not adequately addressed in this House or in the public domain the issues surrounding Article 48.  I will spell it out for him in the very short period I have left.If the EU wanted to agree a common corporation tax system, it would have to do so as part of a broader treaty revision process.  This would require unanimity at Council level and ratification by each member state, including a referendum in this State.  However, Article 48 allows the Council of Ministers to make significant changes to the treaties by unanimity, but without recourse to what some in Europe and in this House see as the cumbersome process of negotiation, ratification and, in Ireland, a democratic referendum.The Lisbon treaty does not affect our tax sovereignty but makes it easier for the Council of Ministers to make changes in the future without the inconvenience of a referendum.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party are already on record as supporting some form of corporate tax harmonisation, while Fianna Fáil, despite its——

Fianna Fáil, despite its assurances, could not be trusted on this or any other matter of importance.With respect to workers' rights and public services, the very fact that the issue is now being treated differently, in the form of a non-legally binding declaration, demonstrates the fine and solemn words are more like an election promise by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael politicians a week before polling day, notwithstanding that there is neither the political will or intention to alter the current direction of EU policy and the European Court of Justice decisions in this regard.  The solemn declaration is laced with false sincerity and is destined to be forgotten the moment the ballot boxes are closed.  I had a number of other issues I wished to raise, but in the months to come we will have a more frank exchange on this.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The Taoiseach has already reported to the House on the institutional issues that were resolved at the Council, namely, Ireland's Lisbon treaty guarantees and the appointment of a new President of the Commission.  I will return to Ireland's legally binding guarantee on security and defence in a moment, but first I wish to report on the important foreign policy issues we considered in Brussels.The Council stressed that the outcome of the Iranian elections should reflect the aspirations and choices of the people of Iran and strongly condemned the use of violence against protestors.  It called for the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and urged the Burmese Government to embark on a genuine transition to democracy which would help bring peace and prosperity to the people of that country who have endured decades of authoritarian rule.The Council condemned the recent nuclear test and missile launches carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  The EU welcomed Pakistan's resolve to step up counter-terrorism efforts and recognises the sacrifices the Pakistani people and armed forces are making.  The Union also committed itself to supporting the Government of Pakistan in implementing a comprehensive rehabilitation and reconstruction plan for the region.  It reaffirmed its long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan on its path to security, stability and prosperity, while stressing that primary responsibility for the development of the country lies with the Afghan authorities.Membership of the European Union enables Ireland's voice to be heard more clearly on international issues.  Through the EU, we can exert a meaningful influence on the world around us.  By combining with countries of like mind, we can help promote the international values we hold dear.  At the Council, Ireland secured a set of legally binding guarantees, which will be annexed to the treaties as a protocol after the Lisbon treaty enters into force.One of these guarantees relates to security and defence.  Some treaty opponents have claimed, mischievously, that this guarantee is not watertight.  They maintain that it will be open to interpretation by the European Court of Justice.  This is totally untrue.  The reality is that the Court has virtually no jurisdiction over the common foreign and security policy of the Union.  This will not change under Lisbon.  The treaty makes this plain.Certain aspects of the Union's external policies will change as a result of Lisbon.  One of the treaty's key aims is to give the Union a more coherent international voice.  Two new posts will be created, the President of the European Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  These new posts are intended to improve the way in which the Union operates internationally.Under the Lisbon treaty, the Union will be better equipped to deal with international crises wherever they arise.  We have had good examples in the past year of why the Union needs to be better equipped to cope with international problems.  Last year's crisis in Georgia underlined the need for a Union capable of speaking and acting cohesively.  The interruption of gas supplies from Russia through the Ukraine in January left homes in a number of EU countries without heating in the depths of winter.  The Union's ability to act in the shared interests of the member states helped defuse that energy security crisis.  Securing Europe's energy supplies will be a continuing priority for the EU in the years ahead.  No small country can possibly cope with such issues alone.Since 2003, the EU has launched 23 crisis management operations, of which 17 have been civilian operations.  Only six of them have been military.  We should be proud that Ireland has been involved in 10 of these missions.  The operations commander for one of them, the EUFOR mission in Chad and the Central African Republic, was an Irish general, Pat Nash.  He led 4,000 troops from 19 nations in a mission which protected 400,000 displaced persons and refugees fleeing the conflict in Darfur.  As a result of their efforts the women in the refugee camps could forage for firewood nearby without running the risk of being raped by rebels or bandits.  Attempts to dismiss operations such as this as some form of imperialism or a militarisation of Europe, as we have just heard, are an insult to the professionals involved and to the vulnerable people they are trying to protect.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Under Lisbon, a new external action service would mean that the professional work of EU experts in conflict prevention and peacekeeping can be better co-ordinated.  The Lisbon treaty is about providing the Union with an enhanced capacity for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the UN charter.It is worth recalling that when he visited Dublin in 2004 the then Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, welcomed the development of the EU capabilities and the work we are doing together in the field of crisis management.  He said he wanted to leave us in no doubt about how important strengthened EU capacities are to the UN. That is why it is so important for Ireland to be fully involved in the EU's foreign and security policy.The legally binding guarantee secured by Ireland at the European Council states that the Lisbon treaty: "does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality".  The guarantee also puts it beyond doubt that the treaty does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation.  The significance of this is that it gives watertight legal assurance to Ireland on these points which were a bone of contention last year.  I would like the coming debate on the Lisbon treaty to concentrate on the reality of the EU's foreign policy, which is fully consistent with Ireland's traditions and aspirations.We need to prevent those who oppose our EU involvement from misrepresenting the Union's external policies.  Those who have doubts can look to our legal guarantees for clear, unambiguous assurance.  No one in Europe wants to cede national responsibility for defence issues.  President Sarkozy made that clear in March when he said:Today, [France's] armed forces are and will remain national because our armed forces are the ultimate expression of our sovereignty.  Our armed forces will not be integrated into any supra-national army whose control is beyond us.  Besides, to be honest, no one wants this ... I have never come across a government which wants a supra-national army.  I have not seen a government at the European Council ever ask for anything other than unanimity on the deployment of forces.Last month the Peace and Neutrality Alliance said there would be a "Yes" vote on Lisbon if there was a legal guarantee on neutrality.  We got that last Friday.  In April, the same alliance urged us to insist on a protocol.  We got that too.  Let me quote from our legally-binding guarantee, soon to be enshrined in a protocol.  It states:The Treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality . . . The Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or for conscription to any military formation . . . It does not affect the right of Ireland to determine the nature and volume of its defence and security expenditure.I repeat: no European army; no conscription; and no obligation to increase our defence spending.  These represent important, explicit assurances.  Fair-minded people will, I believe, see them as putting to rest the various concerns about defence and security that surfaced last year.Deputy Kenny asked about the dairy sector.  The European Council discussed the current situation in the dairy market and invited the Commission to present an in-depth market analysis within the next two months.  The market analysis would include possible options for stabilising the dairy market while respecting the outcome of the health check.  During the discussion, the Taoiseach urged the Commission to take immediate action because the sector is seriously threatened with current price volatility and poor returns in the market.  He emphasised the importance of the milk sector to agriculture and to the economy in general.The Commission's report will be prepared in the context that it must respect the outcome of the health check.  It will be recalled that in the health check negotiations in November 2008, Ireland supported the outcome to increase milk quotas by 1% per annum in each of the five years from 2009 to 2013.  To suspend these increases would limit Ireland's production potential in the medium term.  The issue of a reversal in quota expansion should not arise within the mandate granted by the Council to the Commission.The Community has already agreed to introduce public intervention storage for butter and skimmed milk powder, and a private storage aid scheme for butter.  These schemes will come to a seasonal close in August and, given the current market situation, Ireland has sought the continuation of these schemes for a further period.  In addition, while the Community has reinstated export refunds for butter, skimmed milk powder, whole milk powder and cheese, Ireland believes that refunds should be further increased to enable greater volumes of dairy products to be exported to countries outside of the European Union.The Taoiseach had meetings in Brussels with the IFA and the ICMSA.  They both indicated their firm view that more market support was required from the European Union to address the current slump in dairy prices.  These views were fully reflected at the European Council.

I concur with him on his analysis of the guarantees that have been given as it is important to put these issues to bed.  In many respects, what Deputy Ó Snodaigh said about the treaty not changing is true.  However, surely after these guarantees have been given and the commitment to the protocols made, while the treaty has not changed per se, Deputy Ó Snodaigh’s understanding of it, and that of many of the “No” campaigners, should have changed because what is and is not in the treaty is now clearly outlined.There is also the issue of the political commitment to retain our Commissioner.  Will the Minister outline what the future holds for the current Commission?  Do we know when it will end and when might the Government appoint a replacement Commissioner?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The current Commission is due to reach its conclusion in November, which is why we indicated last December that if we received the necessary guarantees and the change in regard to each member state retaining its Commissioner, we would put the issue before the people to facilitate the formation of the new Commission under the Lisbon treaty.  If the new Commission is appointed under the Nice Treaty, the likelihood is that there will be a reduced Commission, with the implication that Ireland could lose its voice at the Commission table and could lose a Commissioner.  Therefore, it makes sense that if everybody is agreed we should retain our Commissioner, we would vote "Yes" to the Lisbon treaty because that is the only logical, legal way that we can facilitate the retention of a Commissioner for Ireland into the future.I have no idea when Ireland will appoint its Commissioner but that is obviously the Taoiseach's prerogative.

It is welcome news that the European Council will press ahead with the appointment, as was suggested in some of the discussions in the past week.What is the thinking in regard to a nominee for our Commissioner, who must be appointed by November?  It is always extremely important that we get a strong Commissioner who will carry clout and get a strong portfolio.  It was obviously part of the thinking of some of the "No" campaign that we, and each member state, would have a strong Commissioner who sits around the table and carries a fair amount of clout.  Would it not be appropriate that we would have some form of hearing prior to the nomination of a Commissioner and that the House would be involved, rather than it being a simple act of the Executive?  In that way, the eventual nominee would be the agreed nominee of the Oireachtas Members, which is appropriate given the proposed extra powers that will be given to the Oireachtas under the subsidiarity arrangements in the Lisbon treaty, if it goes through on the next occasion?  The Minister might respond.In the context of a question I asked in the course of my earlier remarks, can we get a commitment from the Government on the implementation of domestic legislation concerning workers' rights and social rights issues, particularly those enumerated by Deputy Gilmore in regard to Towards 2016?  It is one thing to pay lip service to workers' rights but, while the amount of such rights to have come from Europe is extraordinary and our legislation and people's rights have been improved no end due to directives from the European Union, we are behind in the implementation and transposition of some of these issues.  Can we get a commitment that critical areas such as the compliance legislation which is before the House and the issues of the agency workers directive, the posting of workers directive and industrial relations matters will be dealt with, that there will be some attempt to deal with them as far as is possible prior to 9 or 10 July and that there will be a commitment to address them afterwards if they cannot be addressed prior to the vote on the referendum?It has been indicated in the media that it is part and parcel of the intentions of the Government to introduce a European Defence Agency Bill that would provide for certain provisions in regard to participation in the European Defence Agency.  Will that legislation come to the House before the Dáil rises?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	367	On the Commissioner issue, that is obviously a function of the Executive and in due course the Taoiseach will take that decision.  All of the activities of the Government in this direction will be to secure an important position for Ireland in a new Commission.  Of course, we must pass the Lisbon treaty first.  If we seek a position of clout, a prerequisite would be the need to endorse and support the Lisbon treaty.  Without this we would enter uncertain territory because we would then operate under the Nice treaty parameters which could potentially mean that we may not get any position.  I am not saying that will be the case but some states will not get any, although we do not know which states.The European Parliament has a very strong role now in vetting the nominees for the role of Commissioner.  In the domestic tradition the post has been selected from among those with an executive function which could lead to a debate or commentary here.  We do not have a process of formal hearings nor will we end up with hearings for those nominated for the post.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I refer to the question on workers' rights issues.  A disappointing aspect of the debate on workers' rights has been the degree to which people glossed over the importance of the charter, which conveys significant additional rights to workers, including rights to information and consultation within an undertaking, the right of collective bargaining and action, the right of access to placement services, protection in the event of unjustified dismissal, fair and just working conditions, prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work and in family and professional life, social security and assistance and so on.  I have made the point to trade unions that, irrespective of what occurs domestically, it is illogical to suggest that a "No" vote against the Lisbon treaty advances the cause of workers.  It is incomprehensible to anyone.Let us consider the charter, which would have treaty force if it is passed.  It clearly advances the cause of workers not only throughout Europe, but here too.  It is the case that issues will flow from it domestically but some countries opted out of the charter because of the rights it enshrined for workers.  If Ireland votes "No", it would disadvantage the position of workers and those in politics who wish to advance the cause of workers' rights in future.  That would be an actual consequence of a "No" vote.  It would impair the capacity of those who wish to advance the cause of workers' rights in Ireland very significantly.  The fundamental issue concerning workers' rights is the charter.  Having considered the matter, I am clearly of the view it represents an advance for workers.The Employment Rights Compliance Bill is before the House and NERA, the National Employment Rights Agency, has been established as part of the Towards 2016 agreement.  It is operational throughout the country and its establishment was necessary because of events involving Gama Construction and other incidents of widespread abuse.  There is also a need for a practical, pragmatic approach in the current environment.  I refer to the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs.  The Taoiseach has consulted with the social partners in the context of social partnership.  I understand amendments in respect of the Bill will be published in July but it is on Committee Stage as we speak.  The Agency Workers Bill should be published shortly and other areas identified by Deputies Joe Costello and Eamon Gilmore are being addressed, some of which are complex, especially those emanating from court judgments last year.  It is intended to publish the EDA, European Defence Agency, Bill sometime before the referendum.

I refer to the European Union and Israel preferential trade agreements.  Was there any discussion on the suspended upgrade of those trade agreements?  Was there a discussion on scrapping or reigniting the suspended trade agreement given the continued settlement policy of Israel in the West Bank and the continued blockade of Gaza?
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I refer to the issue of the new Commission.  Has the Minister any thoughts on how the portfolios in the European Commission might be improved or enhanced after the Lisbon treaty process is completed?  There are concerns in respect of the current Commission, its size and the relevance of some of the portfolios.  Will there be an opportunity to revamp it and to change the portfolios?  What post does the Minister envisage as preferable for the Irish Commissioner in the context of the issue of the European Defence Agency?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	374	Is the Deputy seeking a post?  I refer to two issues raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  A simplified revision procedure applies to Article 40 in certain very limited and defined circumstances.  Under that procedure there is a provision for the European Council to unanimously agree amendments to articles dealing with the internal policies of the union.  However, such amendments cannot increase the union's competencies.  Moreover, they must be approved by all member states in accordance with their respective Constitutional requirements.  I trust this addresses the issue raised earlier by the Deputy related to Article 48.In terms of the Israeli EU upgrade, it was decided that now was not the time to upgrade that relationship or other relations with Israel.  Ireland made a strong contribution at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting.  Some key issues relating to Gaza remain to be dealt with.  The humanitarian crisis is ongoing and is altogether unacceptable in terms of the failure to open up crossings and allow the free flow of aid.I refer to the question on the formation of the Commission and the type of portfolio sought by Ireland.  I have not yet given detailed consideration to the matter.  My immediate priority has been to help and contribute to the process which led to the Council last week, to the ratification by the people of the Lisbon treaty and to argue and persuade for its ratification as the best way to ensure we secure a good portfolio and a seat at the table.  My fear would be that if we do not ratify the Lisbon treaty there is every potential that we may not secure this.Deputy Timmins raised an issue related to Guantanamo Bay.  Yesterday, the Government announced a decision to examine the cases of two detainees cleared for release from Guantanamo Bay.  We have been in consultation with the US State Department to establish how we might assist the USA in finding residence for detainees cleared for release who for compelling reasons cannot be returned to their country of origin.  The US has proposed two detainees for our consideration and their cases are being examined.  EU member states have developed a framework to exchange information among those states which have offered to take detainees.  It is a matter for individual member states to make a decision on whether to accept detainees and, as in our case, other countries are considering their positions.  For example, Prime Minister Berlusconi has indicated that Italy may take up to three detainees.  Outside of the EU, the British dependency of Bermuda accepted four former detainees some ten days ago.  Others are considering similar moves.  We have welcomed President Obama's decision to close Guantanamo Bay and his determination to do so within one year.  I am confident the facility will be closed and any decision to accept detainees is based on that.  We look forward to the report of the US detention task force, expected next month.  It will report on the interrogation, detention, trial and torture practices of the US at Guantanamo Bay.

In particular, my primary motivation in entering government was to tackle the defining issue of climate change.  We have now changed the nature of public discourse on this issue, through many areas of Government action, for example on energy efficiency, building standards, transport emissions and the annual carbon budget, and through our support for an ambitious EU climate policy and leadership role at wider international level.  In order to address the climate challenge it is necessary that our policy and practical responses are consolidated and intensified in the period ahead.The progress being made in many environmental areas, including waste management, where an international review is well advanced, water services, where major investment is being maintained at a time of budgetary constraint, enforcement and compliance, including through the resourcing of the EPA and my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service and the pursuit of sustainable development through strengthened planning under the new Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, are all matters of record.Overall, it is a firm objective of Government to work towards a clean and safe environment for all.  In the context of the planned review of the programme for Government, I am confident that we will build on and strengthen the commitments and objectives already agreed so that the protection and enhancement of the quality of our environment remains at the centre of Government policy.

I ask him to have another go at it and tell the House whether he has ideas which he would like to see in the review of the programme for Government.  Has he a specific statement to make about process and timeline with regard to the output or outcome of these discussions?  Will the result of the review of the programme for Government be put to the members of the Green Party in order to establish whether they agree or disagree with his version of events?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	377	As much as I would like to reveal to the Deputy the elements of the review, I think he will understand that these are matters for the respective parties in government and much of the review process will have to remain confidential and the process and the timeline have not yet been agreed.  One aspect that has been flagged already and I have spoken about it is the idea of a climate change Bill.  This is very close to the heart of many people in my own party and it is also a priority for many of the non-governmental organisations.  Such a Bill would enshrine many of the elements we have already introduced, including the idea of a carbon budget.  This may have to be refined and I am currently considering this matter.For the past number of years the carbon budget has been announced directly after the budget speech.  I am not sure if this is entirely appropriate because it tends to become overshadowed by the budget considerations.  We will have to decide whether it should be held on the next day or a week later.  These may be fairly minor elements but we have set up the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security which is chaired by one of the Deputy's colleagues.  The sub-committee which directs discussions between the various Departments is chaired by the Taoiseach.  This sub-committee aims to ensure that CO2 emissions can be reduced across all Departments.  These are very important considerations but other elements relating to the environment include the progression of the issue of waste management and the very important question of the protection of our waterways and the question of septic tanks — which will be discussed later this afternoon — and a range of other issues.  All these issues will be included in the discussions.  I will be happy to keep the Deputy informed but as yet, we are going through what are called the modalities and the timeline has not been set.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	378	The reason I asked the Minister to outline his priorities is because six weeks ago a review of the programme for Government was a very important issue when his colleague, Senator Boyle, floated the notion.  He must have had a reason for doing so but obviously not so good a reason now that the elections have passed.  In the run-up to the elections we needed something for the Green Party to talk about but since the Minister has now outlined some of the ideas, I ask him whether the White Paper on local government reform will be published — although it is eight or nine months behind time — and will it be done in the context of the forthcoming Commission on Taxation report?  What is the timescale for that report?  The Minister has made one suggestion.The Minister did not do that well in the previous programme for Government because 95% of it was copied and pasted from the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  I am wondering where the big idea is or whether it will be more of the same over the next while.  The climate change Bill is an interesting proposal.  I note that my colleagues in the Labour Party have published a similar Bill and I have views on this subject.  After two years in office I would have thought the Minister would have got agreement from his partners in government about a climate change Bill.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I have stated in the House on previous occasions that I believe there are flaws in the legislation as proposed by the Labour Party and I have outlined some of those flaws to the House.  It is our intention to continue to strengthen environmental legislation.  The Deputy asked about the White Paper on local government.  I agree this will have to be published following the consultation with the Commission on Taxation which is due to report in July.  It would not have made sense, frankly, to publish a White Paper on local government reform and not look at the issue of local government funding and the broadening of the revenue base for local government.Today I am announcing the €200 charge for second homes which should be welcomed by the Deputy's party and other parties if they are serious about local government reform and the need to fund local government.  Progress is being made on a broad range of issues.  The review is taking place and it will be a very thorough review.  I am confident it will strengthen environmental legislation.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Under the Waste Management Acts the statutory responsibility for hazardous waste management planning, including such wastes generated by incineration, rests with the Environmental Protection Agency, which has recently published the National Hazardous Waste Management Plan 2008-2012.  The plan sets out the scope of legislative controls in relation to hazardous waste management and contains recommendations and options for the expansion of hazardous waste treatment facilities to ensure the better management of this waste stream and so that Ireland can fulfil the requirement of the EU Waste Framework Directive that a policy of national self sufficiency in disposal installations be adopted by all member states.The EPA has recently launched a request for a tender to explore the technical and economic aspects of developing a national difficult waste management facility, the primary element of which will be a hazardous waste landfill.  A final report on this study is expected by December 2009.My Department has no role in determining the number, scale or location of hazardous waste management facilities, which are matters for the relevant planning authorities including, as appropriate, An Bord Pleanála and the EPA, in regard to its statutory functions in respect of hazardous waste and the licensing of relevant waste facilities generally.

He is now referring to the context of an international review.  He is also imposing additional costs on landfill.  Why did the Minister wait until two years after his appointment when contracts were signed in relation to Poolbeg, for example, to make a statement?  Were there legal constraints on his doing so sooner?  I would like to hear an explanation.Once a licence has been issued to a landfill operator for the disposal of fly ash, can the Minister give a guarantee that local residents will be informed of the new facility for the disposal of hazardous material?  A number of transparency issues arise if we wish to ensure that people understand what is going on.  Can the Minister clarify?

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The Deputy is talking about hazardous waste facilities.  This is a matter for the EPA and for the contractor, whichever company that may be.  As I outlined, the EPA has done extensive work on this.  The National Hazardous Waste Management Plan 2008-2012 is a statutory document prepared by the EPA in accordance with the Waste Management Acts 1996-2008.  It also satisfies the Hazardous Waste Directive, which requires member states to draw up plans for hazardous waste and sets out priority actions which should be taken during the period of the plan on the prevention of hazardous waste, improved collection rates of certain categories of hazardous waste, the steps required to improve Ireland's self sufficiency in hazardous waste management and the management of certain legacy hazardous waste, such as contaminated soil.  I have been doing that in the context of Haulbowline.  Huge amounts of money have been invested in the remediation of that site.The quantity of hazardous waste generated in 2006 was 284,000 tonnes, which is an 8% decrease since 2004.  Some 31% of this waste was treated on site of generation at EPA/IPPC licensed facilities.  This waste was subject, in various forms, to incineration, solvent recycling, landfill and use as a fuel.  A further 21% was treated off site in Ireland by a network of authorised hazardous waste treatment facilities and 48% of it was exported for treatment abroad, mostly for thermal treatment but also for metal recovery, solvent recovery and landfill.

In other words, what the Minister says on planning and development matters should be respected rather than Government policy.

It will deal in detail with the best options for the future.  The most important thing is that we divert biodegradable waste from landfill.  That is our biggest task in the context of the Landfill Directive.  The best way to do that is to issue the new food regulations.  I hope Ireland will be one of the leading countries in doing so.  That will divert food from restaurants, the commercial sector and homes away from landfill and get away from biodegradable waste, which causes methane and other greenhouse, gases.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	398	In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to the overall management of their capital and current accounts.  These arise from the ongoing requirements for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty and the associated limitation on budget deficits.  In this regard, the Government set a limit of €200 million for the contribution that the local government sector can make to the deterioration in the general Government balance in any one year.  This is not a new requirement for 2009, but current economic and budgetary considerations require all sectors, including local authorities, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.  To stay within the overall limit for the general Government balance, it is necessary for local authorities to manage their finances and to maintain their current and capital accounts broadly in balance for 2009.  Within this general requirement, there is capability for borrowing by local authorities for capital infrastructure.Development contributions have been an important addition to the capital funding resource of local authorities but they are only one element.  Local authorities generate capital income from a variety of sources.  There is no prohibition on councils spending development contributions.  The only requirement on local authorities is that in aggregate capital income should equal capital expenditure in the year.My Department will continue to work closely with local authorities to ensure that within the overall financial limits to be met, decisions on these matters are taken in a way which gives the necessary prioritisation to environmental, economic and social infrastructure as part of the overall contribution to economic recovery.  I recognise that these requirements may pose challenges for a small number of local authorities and I am making every effort to address this matter within the overall GGB requirements for the sector.The accounting code of practice requires local authorities to submit their annual financial statements by 1 July.  Therefore figures for 31 December 2008 are not yet available.  The overall development contributions balance at 31 December 2007, comprising both cash and debtors, is some €1.524 billion.  A breakdown by local authority is in the following table.  These funds are being released over time as projects progress to completion.Auth. No.Auth. NameDevelopment Levies Balance at 31/12/07€

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	399	As the Minister said in his reply, the circular relates to the criteria set out by the Maastricht Treaty regarding borrowing being limited to 3% of gross domestic product.  Section 3.1 of circular letter FIN 03/2009 states that it is most important that expenditure is funded by income received or due within the year.  The environment committee held a meeting yesterday which was attended by the city and county managers.  They were of the view, as I am after reading the circular, that development levies which were held on account on 31 December 2008 are ring-fenced and not for expenditure.  A freeze has been put on this money.  The Minister appears to be contradicting that view this afternoon.  Will he clarify if local authorities can spend development levies held on account before 1 January 2009?  There is a critical sum involved.In September 2008, I put a parliamentary question to the Minister asking how much money in development levies was being held on account by local authorities.  I still await a reply.  The Minister said he would forward the figures to me, but they have not been furnished by the Department.  The reason I ask this question is that the Comptroller and Auditor General told us at the start of the year that €1.5 billion was being held on account.  If two thirds of that money has been spent in 2008, there is approximately €500 million still held on account.  The €0.5 billion was paid by developers and people extending and carrying out other works on their homes to get infrastructural expenditure in their communities, be it water systems or a swing in a local playground.  Is that money now tied up or can local authorities spend it?  What the Minister said this afternoon appears to contradict what the city and county managers told the committee yesterday.

The Deputy referred in his question to a prohibition on the spending of development levies.  There is no such prohibition.  Our intention is to ensure we have as much flexibility as possible.  I am conscious of the needs of the local authorities and, indeed, I have spoken to the managers.  I understand how difficult the situation is.  However, it should be remembered that when we refer to the general Government balance, we are referring to an aggregate.  I have spoken to my officials at length about this.  What is required is continuing discussion and dialogue between my Department and the various local authorities so they can prioritise certain infrastructural projects.There are difficulties with certain local authorities — I am aware of each of them — who have accumulated a large amount in development levies.  They would like to spend as much of that as they possibly can but under the current rules that might not be possible.  That is not to say they can spend nothing; they can spend.  The question is how we do that and which infrastructural projects can be prioritised.  It is a balancing act.  We are dealing with this on a national basis.  It is the only way we can deal with it because of the commitments we made under the Maastricht Treaty.  We are obliged to do this, and I hope the Deputy understands that.  We cannot work it in any other way.

Had the Minister been able to answer my parliamentary question last September he might not have been required to take such a sweeping action because he would have known what money was held on account in development levies.  For the record, there is a sum of €200 million which the Minister appears to be trying to cover under the circular letter.  The sum held in development levies — I can only imagine the amount——

There is no prohibition on it being spent but it requires the council to speak directly to my Department to see if it is possible under the circumstances.  I will supply the Deputy with all the details.  He asked about county and city councils and the figures are detailed in the reply.  There is no blanket ban on these councils spending money.  That is simply not the case, although that is what the Deputy implied in the question.  It is not true.

He should check the record of the committee meeting yesterday.  The county and city managers are on record as having an entirely different interpretation, which is in section 3.1 of a letter sent to them by the Minister.  The Minister's words are in black and white and state that they cannot spend this money.  The Minister is saying this afternoon that they can.  He must issue a statement.  He is a fair man for going out onto the plinth to make a comment when it suits him.  He needs to go there this afternoon and clarify this.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	414	At the risk of repeating myself, the Deputy states in his question that there is a prohibition on spending of all development levies.  That is not the case, there is no such prohibition in place.  However, we must comply with the Maastricht criteria and we are doing that through intensive dialogue with the various local authorities.  My officials are working intensively on that.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	415	In October 2008, as part of budget 2009, the Government announced its intention to introduce a €200 charge on non-principal residences and I have arranged that the legislation necessary to give effect to this measure will be published today.  The charge will apply mainly to the owners of residential rental property, holiday homes and vacant properties unless the vacant property is newly-constructed but unsold.The charge is estimated to raise some €40 million annually and it will be collected and retained by local authorities.  It is the first locally-based revenue stream to be made available to local authorities since the abolition of domestic rates over 30 years ago.  I consider this to be a very significant development — it will reduce the dependency of local authorities on central funding and it will be a stable income stream, unlike the transaction-based property taxes on which our economy had become unduly dependent.  These taxes — property-related stamp duty, capital gains tax and value added tax — are volatile and over-responsive to prevailing economic conditions.More generally, the Commission on Taxation has been asked to examine our taxation system with particular reference to a number of factors, including the options for future financing of local government.  I have no doubt that the commission will consider this matter in depth, including the matter of property taxes generally, and I await its report.  The Government will give careful consideration to the commission's report, which will be available in the near future.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	439	Achieving and maintaining high quality bathing water at designated bathing water sites is a priority for my Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the relevant local authorities, given the important role that our beaches play in attracting tourists and providing recreational opportunities for local people in a safe and clean environment.The EPA's report on the quality of bathing water in Ireland 2008 noted that the overall quality of bathing water remains high.  In areas where bathing waters fail to meet the EU mandatory standards, the EPA actively follows up on these cases and takes the necessary enforcement actions.The quality of bathing waters at designated bathing water sites is directly affected by the quality of waters flowing into them.  I have taken a number of steps to address discharges from municipal and agricultural sources, the two main contributors to water quality problems.  In 2007, I introduced the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations which require local authorities to obtain discharge licences from the EPA for wastewater treatment plants.  These licences impose emission limits on the discharges, compliance with which is overseen by the EPA.  In addition, in March 2009, I revised the nitrates regulations in order to provide for better farmyard management and to strengthen the enforcement provisions of the regulations.Since 2000, a total of €2.5 billion has been invested in wastewater treatment and collection systems under my Department's water services investment programme.  Many of the new schemes provided were in coastal locations and had a direct, positive benefit on water quality in these areas.  The Government commitment to the ongoing improvement of water quality is evidenced in the €500 million allocated to the water services investment programme this year.  The programme will fund works at a number of the sites where blue flags have been lost.  Work is also well advanced on the development of river basin management plans.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	440	The problem with the news about the blue flag beaches is that this year we are going backwards.  As I outlined in my question, we went from having 83 blue flags in 2007 to 77 in 2009.  As the Minister said, clean beaches are very important for our tourism industry.  We can do without such bad news at this time.  Not only tourists but Irish families go to beaches at this time of year.  This is very important for our economy because there is a significant spin-off in the use of local services, shops and cafes at beaches.  This news will not help us at a time when we must do everything we can to stimulate our economy, particularly the economies of coastal areas at this time of year.I have another question regarding a matter that emerged at the same time, namely, uncollected rubbish at beaches after the June bank holiday weekend.  That was further bad news about our beaches.  Tourists come to Ireland and many Irish people stay here because of the perception that the country has a good and clean environment, with clean and safe beaches.This must be given priority.  I appreciate what the Minister said about wastewater treatment but there is an element of remoteness in his reply.  I want to think that as Minister, Deputy Gormley will play a hands-on role in ensuring we win back blue flags for the beaches that lost them.  What kind of monitoring will he do?  It is not enough to say, for example, that he is setting aside €500 million and the EPA will do this or that.  Will he check on this matter during the year so that next year we might gain more blue flags, winning back the ones we lost without losing any others?Can we ensure that our beaches are cleaned up by the councils and that they have the necessary staff to do this?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I entirely agree with the Deputy about the tourism benefits of having pristine beaches all over the country.  It enhances the quality of life of citizens in this city to have magnificent beaches on our doorstep.  It must be said, and the EPA made clear in its report, that there was a significant problem with rainfall when the monitoring was being done last year which accounted for the bad readings.  That is inevitable when there are unprecedented volumes of rainfall.  Run-off, which comes not only from rivers and riverine inputs but also from elsewhere, leads to bad water quality.  It is as simple as that.  Those are the inevitable consequences of heavy rainfall.  Consider the flash floods in County Donegal yesterday.  Donegal has fantastic beaches but if one were to take readings around the area after such heavy rainfall one would find there was a deterioration in the bathing water quality.I hope we will have a good summer this year, that there will be better readings and that we can regain the blue flags.  It must be stated, because I do not believe this was made clear, that there were a number of gains in the matter of blue flags.  In 2009, for example, Clogher Head and Greystones gained blue flags and in 2008 Dollymount, Culduff and Morriscastle gained blue flags which they held in 2009.

Apart from capital investment, are there steps that can be taken in the short term to deal with the matters which affect the quality of bathing water?  Can anything be done to ensure that each year we can raise the bar?

I go to Seapoint and the Forty Foot but if one is out there after heavy rainfall the water is brown.  It is as simple as that and very difficult to treat.  I was talking to one of the engineers on Dublin City Council about this.  If one goes to any of the Caribbean islands where there are no rivers one sees crystal clear water, but where there are rivers with run-off there will be difficulties such as turbidity and deterioration.I cannot predict the weather for the summer but I hope that if we have a good August we will have good readings for our water.  I am hopeful about that.

#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 56 and 60 together.Over 1,400 prospective purchasers have formally registered interest on the dedicated home choice loan website and, to date, 33 applications have been made, with two approvals issued in principle.  A significant number of inquiries have also been received from brokers in relation to applications that may be pending.  No loan draw downs have yet taken place.The home choice loan was introduced not to provide an incentive for households to enter the housing market, but to provide mortgage finance to facilitate certain first-time buyers who have decided to purchase a home at this time.  The scheme is, therefore, designed to respond, in a very targeted way, to a specific set of circumstances in the housing market whereby prospective middle income first-time buyers who would previously have been in a position to access mortgage finance from one of the financial institutions, are not currently in a position to do so, due to the impacts of the credit crunch.The scheme is operated by four local authorities acting on a regional basis, with administrative support from a central processing unit in the affordable homes partnership.  Total costs of some €280,000 have been incurred on establishing the scheme to date and these have been met from within existing resources.  The projected costs for the remainder of 2009 and 2010 are €10,000 and €20,000, respectively.  In addition, it is expected that the ongoing administrative costs will be met from normal lending margins.The home choice taken applies to new houses and self-builds because a significant majority of first time buyers purchase new houses.  At the time of introduction of the scheme the average new house price was almost 14% lower than the average second-hand house price, so it was considered appropriate to target the scheme towards properties which are more affordable for first-time buyers.  The price differential between new and second-hand houses nationally remains significant, at 13%.  I do not, therefore, propose to amend the terms of the scheme at this time.However, as indicated previously, I will keep the scheme under review.  In that context, particular attention will be paid to any changes in purchasing tendencies amongst first-time buyers generally, as well as to the impacts of the Government's wider efforts, through measures such as the bank guarantee and recapitalisation schemes, to ensure that Irish financial institutions have access to the normal funding necessary to operate their day-to-day business in the mortgage market.

The statistics he has given paint a damning picture of this scheme.  There were 33 applicants, two approvals and no loans have been drawn down yet.  In light of that, would the Minister of State review the effectiveness of this scheme?The Fine Gael Party opposed this scheme during its introduction stating it would trap people in negative equity and encourage them to borrow up to seven times their salary.  In light of the statistics he has given, can he review this scheme?  Clearly, it is not working.  It was targeted specifically at first homes.  Would he now include second-hand homes in its remit?

First, there is no question of people borrowing seven times their income.

It is there, not with any incentive or inducement.We are not yet in a position to state that the home choice loan is not being drawn down for reasons that may not be altogether apparent, namely that it may be a spur to the financial institutions to give loans knowing that this alternative exists or that people are not entering the purchase market at this time.  There are a number of reasons.I had said all along that it is a temporary measure.  I will keep it under review.  It is there as an alternative facility for people who cannot get a mortgage in the normal situation.  I am not in a position to withdraw it or to change it at this time, but it will be kept under review.I also reject that there is any question of the Government putting people into the sub-prime market.  This is totally incorrect.  In fact, there is no incentive at all in the scheme, which is based on a variable rate.  It is for people who have already made a decision to buy a house and who, for one reason or another, cannot get a mortgage due to the credit crunch.  It is for the middle-income families above those who are on the social or affordable housing level.  It is for people who are on an income of €40,000 as an individual and €50,000 as a couple, and the maximum loan is €285,000.People make their own decisions on this.  As I stated, there is no incentive or inducement.  If that were the case, then I could stand accused.  Indeed, another accusation made was that I was attempting to bail out developers.  Deputy Flanagan did not make that but others have.  I certainly reject there being any question of this putting people into the sub-prime area.  That has not happened.

At best, when this scheme was introduced the Minister of State could have been accused, if not of bailing out developers, of at least putting a false floor on the housing market so that properties would not fall below it by bringing in the €285,000 maximum loan.  That is the most benign accusation that could be made against the Minister of State in this regard.I note that in response to the question by Deputy Upton, who specifically asked for the cost of administration of the scheme to date, in excess of a quarter of a million has been spent on a scheme which is out of date, which does not reflect the current market, in which there are four local authorities tied up and in which there are no purchases proceeding.  Will the Minister of State scrap this scheme and stop the excessive waste of public money in today's economic climate on what is a failed and flawed project?

I have no intention of denying those people an opportunity if they want to build or buy a house for themselves.  The scheme is there to facilitate them.The start-up costs are those incurred by people who are already working for the Affordable Homes Partnership.  The start-up costs were the largest part of the €280,000.  Remember that such a facility is now used for the processing of loans throughout the local authority system.  In many ways, it is money well spent.

It will be kept constantly under review.  A number of people have shown an interest and have gone through formal applications, and it would be inappropriate to deny them the opportunity we presented in this scheme.Deputies should remember that there are two other aspects to this.  The existence of this facility may have spurred financial institutions to give out loans where they might not have done so in the past.  In addition, since September the recapitalisation of the banking institutions was proposed and implemented and these banks are providing loans as well.Also, the sentiment in the market may say that people are not purchasing.  There is no great information available to us that people are purchasing houses at present.  While 1,400 have already registered an interest, they may be waiting, like others who have been going through the financial institutions, to see whether we have reached the floor in terms of house prices.  There are a number of factors at play here.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The figures in terms of this scheme involve four local authorities, expenditure in excess of €0.25 million, 1,000 people expressing an interest, 33 of whom wanted to have another look and two who decided that they might go for approval.  A marketing firm would not market a product on the basis of those figures.  What are we talking about here?  One thousandth of those who come across the scheme are interested in it or are gullible enough to buy into it.The sums, the percentages and the marketing figures all show that this is a flawed product.  It is time to scrap it.  Will the Minister of State, in the context of the next budget, state that this is money badly spent, accept that we are in a hole, put down the shovel and let us get out?

That is the way it works in the real world, with loan approval being issued up to a certain figure to allow candidates to participate in a scheme.  I ask the Minister of State to examine other ways of meeting the same objective, perhaps by looking again at the shared ownership schemes operated by the local authorities.  I understand the limit in respect of local authority loan approvals was recently increased to €220,000.  Will the Minister of State consider whether it can be increased further?  Essentially, the home choice loan scheme is a publicity stunt and it is not working.

Specifically, I have introduced two new types of loan, namely, the incremental purchase scheme and the equity loan.  These measures represent significant movement in this area.  The home choice loan scheme is essentially a facility for people who wish to build a house but are unable to access finance in the current economic climate.  The website received 6,000 or 7,000 hits, with 1,400 people expressing a direct interest.  There have been 33 formal applications.  I am anxious that those applications be followed through so that people in this category are looked after.  As I said, the loan facility is under review.  It will be removed only when it is no longer necessary.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	460	Since the current programme for Government was finalised two years ago, significant process has been made in implementing the measures relating to housing provision.  While the process and time line for the review of the programme will be a matter for the leaders of the Government parties, I am confident that the programme, as reviewed, will continue to reflect the importance attaching to the range of priorities in the housing area.  This will provide a strong platform for building on the considerable progress already made across a range of housing policies and programmes and associated legislation.The scale and composition of the social housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on several factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.  Subject to these factors, and taking account of the increase in housing needs evident in last year's housing needs assessment, I am determined to ensure the programme is framed in a manner that optimises the use of available Exchequer supports and explores alternative solutions to addressing housing needs.  This will provide a robust basis for maximising the capacity to meet housing needs, particularly in respect of the most vulnerable sections of society.In regard to affordable housing, it is evident that the housing market has changed significantly since 2007, with substantial improvements in the affordability of housing.  The question of future commitments in respect of affordable housing must take this into account, together with the extent to which there is a significant quantum of completed affordable housing currently available for sale.

More than 56,000 people are currently on the social and affordable housing lists.  Under the national development plan, 60,000 new social housing units and 40,000 affordable units were to be provided.  Will the Minister of State indicate what the revised targets will be?
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I expect there to be some adjustment to the figure of 56,000, and that figure will be available in the coming weeks.  It is important to note that there are various ways in which people's housing needs are met other than via the social housing programme, including the voluntary housing programme, the rental accommodation scheme and the new long-term leasing scheme.  The resources available this year will allow for 7,000 social housing units to be acquired by local authorities and the voluntary sector, including the roll-out of the new long-term leasing arrangement.  Funding for the rental accommodation scheme has increased from €51 million to €90.5 million in 2009, an increase of 77%.  In all, the needs of some 19,500 households were met in 2008 through the full range of social and affordable housing measures.  It is expected that a similar level of housing need will be met in 2009.  This equates to a 32% increase on the 2006 provision.  I expect to meet the targets for 2009.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	463	By the end of the year, there may be in excess of 4,000 affordable housing units lying vacant.  I agree that the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, to be debated tomorrow, includes several positive incentives in regard to the purchasing of homes under various social housing streams.  However, how does the Minister of State intend to rectify the situation whereby the affordable housing programme is clearly no longer competitive when compared to what is available on the open market?  Does he intend to give direction to local authorities that the prices of affordable homes must be reduced?  Those prices were agreed with developers two years ago in an entirely different housing market.  Unless prices are reduced, these units will remain vacant at the end of the year.

#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	466	In regard to vacant properties, we have asked for an updated audit.  I recently allocated almost €20 million to local authorities throughout the State to bring housing stock back into use.  It is expected that some 1,500 of those vacant houses will be turned around.  We are allowing €15,000 per unit, which would be 75% of the cost, with local authorities providing the remainder from their own resources.  This comes under the retrofit scheme, under which I have directed funding for this purpose for 2009.Deputy Tuffy referred to recent "Drivetime" reports.  I insisted on taking part in that programme because of the inaccuracies being put forward and the one-sided debate that was taking place.  Some of the statistics were also challenged by a representative of Dublin City Council.  For example, a figure was given for the purchase of a house but it was not pointed out that this property included an adjacent site.  That information was conveniently omitted.  In another instance reference was made to the high price paid for a house without any indication that the local authority was using it to accommodate a family with special needs.  These circumstances must be taken into consideration.There is no question that local authorities should vacate the market simply because market prices are now low.  Local authorities must continue to provide houses for those who need them.  In regard to value for money, there is significant expertise within the local authority system.  Those people are in position to value the market and to set prices.  It is important to note what has been done in recent years in response to pressures on affordable housing.  Affordable housing output increased significantly between 2004 and 2008, reaching 4,500 units last year.As everyone knows, affordability and the market have matched recently.  The Department closely monitors developments as regards unsold affordable housing.  We issued further guidelines to local authorities on their affordable housing stock in which we set out a number of options.  We also asked them to reduce prices to ensure they are able to offload affordable housing units.  The Department has been informed by the local authorities that they are in a position to dispose of approximately 1,000 units on the open market.  We have also asked them to consider other options if they are unable to sell these units under the affordable housing scheme.  For example, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 provides for an incremental purchase scheme.  Individual local authorities may consider offering potential buyers the option of purchasing under this scheme.I have also indicated that in certain circumstances, when local authorities are experiencing pressure on the social housing side, I would be willing to consider other options.  They must, however, in as far as possible continue to take a sustainable communities approach to social and affordable housing developments.

I read the circular issued to the local authorities by the Department and reducing prices was not among the options it set out.  May I assume from the Minister of State's statement that a further circular has been issued in the meantime advising local authorities that they may reduce the prices of affordable housing units?  If so, will he furnish me with a copy of the document?

Some local authorities have taken a focused approach to sales, particularly in the Dublin region, and consult the Department regularly.  We continue to monitor developments in this regard.

Similar schemes are in place in certain local authority areas here.  Under statute, the primary response to litter is a matter for local authorities.  My Department's role is to provide the legislative framework for combating litter pollution and motivate and energise anti-litter responses, as necessary.  It is the responsibility of each local authority to enforce the litter laws and determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution within the relevant legislation.The anti-litter awareness grant scheme operated by the local authorities and which my Department is responsible for administering, has in recent years included projects of the type referred to in the question.  This year, I have allocated a total sum of €1.07 million for grant purposes and a number of adopt-a-road and adopt-a-bring bank schemes proposed by local authorities will receive financial support from my Department.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	473	Does the Minister agree that if one travels any country road, one will see bags of rubbish dumped on the roadside and nappies and various other types of household rubbish strewn across hedgerows?  Is he happy to preside over such conditions?  Does he agree the problem is deteriorating rather than improving?  What initiatives does he propose to introduce to address the problem?Does the Minister agree that as well as its awful visual impact, fly-tipping is impacting on tourism and health?  In most other European countries, the problem is not as serious as it is here.  Does the Minister agree that positive initiatives are required to educate people and increase civic awareness?  A sense of patriotism is needed and serious sanctions must be imposed to hurt those who are caught fly-tipping?  What measures will the Minister introduce to address the problem?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	474	While I agree that anecdotal evidence suggests fly-tipping has increased, I remind the Deputy of the results of a survey published recently by Irish Business Against Litter, IBAL, which does fantastic work.  My Department's national litter pollution monitoring system will also publish results soon.  The results of both IBAL and my Department's system point to a steady reduction in litter levels across the country.  According to the IBAL report published last week, 68% of areas monitored are clean to European norms, up from 40% in 2002.  Steady progress has been made and the IBAL findings are echoed in the findings of the national litter pollution monitoring report which shows that 66% of areas surveyed displayed high levels of cleanliness compared to 48% in 2002.  While specific results relating solely to roadside litter are not available, figures from that area clearly feed into the national results.  It is clear, therefore, that some improvement has been made, particularly in cities.On the issue of fly-tipping, we must catch people in the act.  A monitoring programme in place in my Department has been highly effective.  Footage from CCTV cameras installed in the national parks, which I have seen, shows people fly-tipping.  Some of the individuals in question are regular offenders and the footage shows the registration numbers of their cars as they engage in deliberate fly-tipping.Deputy Stanton referred to civic mindedness and patriotism.  The individuals in question do not have any clue about such concepts but are simply trying to get away with not paying waste charges.  A number of steps must be taken.  Proper registration is required across the country to identify those who are registered as paying waste charges with the local authorities.  As the Deputy will be aware, a significant number of private waste disposal operators are seeking to attract customers by offering what they claim to be a better deal than that on offer from the local authorities.  Unfortunately, a significant number of people slip between the cracks and may not be registered with a private operator or local authority.  We need to establish who is registered for waste services as it is clear some of those who are not registered are engaged in fly-tipping on roadsides and in some of our most scenic areas, including the national parks.  As I stated, the Department has an operation in place in the national parks and I hope shortly to reveal its results  in order that we can secure prosecutions and make examples of these litter louts.

One sees bags of rubbish on roadsides in the middle of nowhere.  I agree, however, that the position in the cities has improved.  Does the Minister propose to establish some form of database recording which citizens or households are registered with local authorities and private operators?  If so, will those who are not registered be pursued?  What is meant by his statement that a register of householders registered with the local authorities and private operators is required?  What action does he plan to take?

Under legislation, people will have to dispose of their rubbish or waste in an environmentally friendly manner.  In other words, they will be required to register with a local authority or private operator.  The only conclusion one can reach is that those who are not registered are either fly-tipping or burning their waste.  The question of whether a regulator should be established in the areas of waste has been discussed and I have come to the conclusion that such a regulator is required.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	481	Primary responsibility for the prevention of pollution from septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems rests with owners or occupiers of premises served by such systems.  In its water quality 2004-06 report published in 2008, the EPA noted, inter alia, that greater attention needed to be given to ground water protection and in particular to prevention of pollution at source, including pollution from septic tanks.  A number of measures have been taken or are under way in this area.  These include strengthened legal provisions under the Water Services Act 2007 to require the occupier or owner of a premises to ensure that waste water from the premises does not cause nuisance or risk to human health or the environment; an updated code of practice for waste water treatment systems for single houses developed by the EPA which will incorporate the requirements of new European standards due to come into force on 1 July 2009; and a pilot waste water collection and treatment project for rural villages which has now been completed.I am conscious of the need to address the findings of the EPA report on preventing pollution at source, including from septic tanks.  The European Court of Justice is also due to rule in a case pertaining to the treatment of waste water from septic tanks in Ireland later this year.The programme for Government includes a commitment in regard to a scheme of support for the replacement and upgrade of septic tanks older than 15 years with newer systems.  While my Department has been examining the conditions which might attach to such a scheme, the timeframe for pursuing this commitment will remain under ongoing active review, having regard to current budgetary constraints.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	482	That is the most meaningless reply I have ever heard from a Minister.  Nothing meaningful has happened regarding the objective of improving our ground water and addressing contamination from septic tanks.  We have been waiting 18 years for the EPA manual to be updated.  The Minister is implying that the commitments of the programme for Government are null and void and there is no commitment to meet the water framework directive obligations arising from the contamination of ground water by septic tanks.  We are prepared to pay fines to the European Commission rather than do something meaningful about improving ground water.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	483	That is not the case.  This is a serious problem because there are approximately 418,000 septic tanks in the country compared to England which has just over 800,000 despite being one of the most densely populated countries in the world.  That puts the matter in perspective.The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, of which Deputy Hogan is a member, made recommendations which make sense in the context of current budgetary constraints.  It has recommended that my Department develop a strategy to address concerns regarding pollution of ground water resources and the rural environment.  I assure the Deputy that will be done.  It also recommended that local authorities should police on-site sewage treatment and disposal processes through a variety of measures, including the establishment of panels of approved system designers, site assessors and inspection and enforcement officers, and that incentives to upgrade existing septic tanks should be introduced.  I have indicated that the final recommendation is subject to budgetary constraints but that does not rule out the necessity of a proper inspection regime.  The fact of the matter is that a laissez faire approach was taken to septic tanks.  For whatever reason, county engineers have allowed tanks to be constructed in totally inappropriate soil types.  We need to tighten up the regulations across the board.It is not fair to say that we are prepared to pay fines because that is not something I want to countenance.  I am absolutely committed to dealing with this problem but given the multitude of houses that have installed septic tanks, it is not an easy proposition.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	484	The Minister likes to think this is just a rural issue but there are septic tanks near Dublin Airport.  It is as much an urban issue as it is a rural one in many parts of the country because we have not invested sufficiently in group schemes and public systems.  The Minister is admitting that he has taken no initiative to address the contamination of ground water even after waiting 18 years for a manual on updated best practice.  That is not good enough.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that a scheme of upgrading septic tanks will be put in place in 2010 arising from the review of the programme for Government?

which have been discussed by the relevant committees in recent weeks.It will be useful to outline the economic context of the Revised Estimates.  Our economy has been hit by substantial external and internal shocks and we are expecting a cumulative loss in national income of approximately 13% between 2008 and 2010.  On the external side, the fall-out from the deepest and most widespread international recession in more than half a century is having major repercussions in Ireland, particularly given the globally integrated nature of our economy.  Domestically, the adjustment in the residential construction sector to more sustainable levels of output will subtract nearly 4% from economic activity this year, accounting for roughly half of the anticipated annual decline in GDP.  Arising from this are spillover effects to other sectors of the economy, as reflected in the weakening labour market in recent months.Our approach is to position the economy to benefit from the global recovery as it emerges.  Our export sectors are proving robust and our labour force continues to be highly skilled and flexible.  We are continuing to invest in education at all levels in order to ensure we have the skills demanded by our increasingly knowledge intensive economy.  Our international cost competitiveness is improving, due in part to wage flexibility in both the public and private sectors.  This is a significant achievement which many countries would wish to emulate.  Adjustments have been made to work practices and other labour market costs to safeguard employment.The Government remains committed to providing a pro-enterprise environment and maintaining our relatively low tax burden on business.  We are also maintaining capital spending at a high level by international standards to allow us to continue our investment in productive infrastructure.  Through implementing the correct policies now we will safeguard our recent progress, much of which has survived the downturn, and secure our future prospects.  Strong, sustainable public finances are key to ensuring confidence in the Irish economy and the actions taken by the Government to date to address the budgetary difficulties will ensure this.The Government is committed to restoring order to the public finances and the allocations presented in the Revised Estimates for Public Services in 2009 play a key role in this.  These Estimates reflect the necessary expenditure measures introduced by the Government over the past year while protecting possible vital front line services as much as possible.  I will not recap the various measures that were adopted other than to say that there were four stages of budgetary adjustment since July 2008, including the October 2009 budget, the further savings secured in February along with the public service pension levy and the supplementary budget in the spring.The process of adjustment for this year has been completed and amounts to a cumulative fiscal correction of 5%, one of the highest in western Europe.  That the Government secured it within one year is a tremendous achievement.  Given the scale of the international downturn, the adjustment was essential.  It is obvious that international confidence in the country has recovered because of the steps taken by the Government, notwithstanding the banking sector practices that came to light.  These actions were essential to stabilise the public finances and to ensure that the general government deficit does not exceed 10.75% of GDP in 2009.  While this is a high-level deficit, it represents the most appropriate target for the year, given the current conditions in the Irish economy.As Deputies are aware, the supplementary budget also set out a plan to bring the general government deficit to within 3% of GDP by 2013.  This strategy has received the backing of the EU Commission.  As the House knows, the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, SGPSNEP, is reviewing the scope for reducing or refocusing the existing range of expenditure programmes.  Given the scale of the expenditure adjustments now required, no area of expenditure can be excluded from this process.  Not only are spending programmes being examined, but the overall efficiency of the public service is being considered, including any ways of doing business that are out of step with the needs of a modern, responsive public service.  The group is also examining and will make recommendations for further rationalisation of State agencies beyond the measures announced in budget 2009.  I expect to receive the report in the next few weeks.  Clearly, this will give the Government options and enable a public debate on the choices that we face.  How much time have I used?

To this end, the Exchequer capital allocation in 2009 published in the Revised Estimates for public services 2009 is for more than €7.3 billion.  This is a substantial outlay, given the dramatic drop in Exchequer revenues and the increase in Government borrowing.  The allocation amounts to 5% of gross national product, which is among the highest in the former EU 15 member states.It is our intention to ensure that this expenditure is targeted to achieve the maximum economic return while presenting the best value for money to the Exchequer.  Within this context, we are targeting investment that will support sustainable employment, have the optimal impact on employment and help Ireland to take advantage of an eventual upswing in the economy.  Indeed, with this prioritisation of investment in mind, the Government has already redirected €150 million in February within the 2009 allocation to areas that are both labour intensive and of high economic value.  Some €75 million of this money went to sustainable energy schemes, including €50 million for the home energy saving scheme, and €75 million went to the school building programme.Within the 2009 capital allocation, continuing national development plan, NDP, investment can be seen across all sectors.  Obviously, this will not completely arrest the contraction being experienced by the construction sector, but the investment in our capital programme will provide a certain level of ongoing activity in this sector while providing us with the infrastructure to enhance our return when the upswing comes.  The Government is examining the potential for unlocking investment by pension funds and other institutional investors in the public infrastructure market.  The contraction in the construction sector reflects the substantial collapse in private sector investment in construction.  The challenge for the Government is to restore confidence in the public finances and thereby restore confidence in the economy.  This will encourage the resumption of investment by the private sector in construction.As a Government, we have needed to introduce a series of measures over the past year to tackle the unprecedented deterioration in the public finances.  All of the measures announced since July last year, both expenditure-reducing and revenue-raising, have cumulatively delivered adjustments of approximately 5% of GDP for 2009.  We did not flinch in making these difficult choices.  To meet the general government deficit target of 3% by 2013, further decisions will be required in all areas of policy.  In this context, the Commission on Taxation and the SGPSNEP will have a significant role to play.  Their two reports will set the context for a real political debate on policy options.  It will not be a comfortable debate, but it will be an inevitable one that will force every Deputy, including those in Opposition parties, to address the real world in which we must all now live.  There are no soft options or safe hiding places.  The time has now come to tell the people what they would do were they on this side of the House.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20555	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	497	Excellent.  I welcome the debate because it provides an opportunity before the House recesses to review what impact the recent budget has had.  Sadly, the economic details published since the budget suggest that it is not even achieving the objectives set in its own narrow terms.  The ESRI and, today, the OECD indicate that the Government will not meet its budgetary targets.  More worrying is what they claim will occur to the real economy.  According to the ESRI, 300,000 jobs will be lost between 2009 and 2010.  The impact on families will be immeasurable.  The OECD's report, published today, suggests that the decline in GDP will be 20% worse than forecasted by the ESRI.  If true, 20% can be added to the predicted job losses, if not more.  Another 60,000 or 80,000 jobs being wiped out on top of the ESRI's forecast is frightening.My continuing concern with the budget is its narrow focus.  It has taken the easy route of raising tax and cutting capital spending.  The Minister rightly stated that the core action for policy was to deal with value for money within public spending.  However, he put this off and asked others, the McCarthy Group, to investigate the issue.  The determination and decision to put things off, to refuse to face consequences and to aim for the tax-raising option instead, are not affordable.  In our heart of hearts, we know that the way out of this recession will not be found by loading taxes onto families and businesses that are already under severe pressure.The success of the banking policy, which the Government believes is the pillar of its strategy, is yet to be seen in practical terms, given the fact that businesses cannot get credit.  The Minister will tell the House that the anecdotal evidence given to us by people around the country is not supported by hard evidence.  Where is the Minister's review of credit?  In March, we were to have detailed reports on declined credit, that is, where companies had been turned down, and on how credit was flowing to small businesses.  The Minister did not deliver.  Although we committed money to guaranteeing the banks, their commitment to showing whether they were meeting the needs of small businesses has not been honoured, not even to the extent of providing to the Minister the statistics promised to the Dáil.We are in a serious dilemma.  Like our predecessors, including the former Minister for Finance, Seán Lemass, who later became Taoiseach, we must recognise——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20555	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I beg to differ.  He was the Minister for Finance according to John Horgan.  Perhaps I am wrong and I will bow to the Minister's greater knowledge in these matters.  However, the truth of the matter is that Seán Lemass recognised the need to abandon failed policies and to confront issues instead of getting stuck in a narrow orthodoxy on fiscal retrenchment.  He saw that people must have confidence in the State and its ability to create opportunities.  Fine Gael has backed this thinking.  Our new era document calls for investment in key infrastructure funded not by the Exchequer, but by using pension reserve funds and private investment capital.  This opportunity is not being grasped.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20555	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	501	This morning, we learned that the Government is considering a fund of €1 billion for job protection.  This would be welcome in so far as it would show that, at last, employment is on the radar.  However, I would ask hard questions about it.  If we are to have a selective scheme that focuses on just 10% of the manufacturing sector, which constitutes approximately 15% of employment, what will it do?  Will companies spend all of their time trying to find out whether they can get past some bureaucrat to avail of the aid, will it postpone the necessary adjustment or will it reduce sustainable costs for everyone, namely, the cost of doing business, thereby giving every business a chance to survive in this difficult time?  I wonder about the direction of that intervention.  I see the need for a much more broad-based strategy to bring down costs generated in the Government sector, and to drive them down in the way Lemass confronted the challenges in the 1950s.  I am disheartened by the shape of the strategy being pursued by Government.  We need to have a fresh debate.  I look forward to a debate, not just about the public finances where difficult decisions must be made, but on the broader strategy of how we protect, create and sustain employment.

The OECD report refers to the fact that exports will fall.  We are a small open economy and we must get exports to grow.  Dr. Ken Whittaker was associated with Seán Lemass.  To some extent they are synonymous.  He stated categorically that our biggest problem was our lack of competitiveness.  The Minister is probably aware that our exports fell for the first time in 2003.  We became extremely uncompetitive and the economy began to depend on the construction sector.  The key issue is to restore competitiveness, get back to being a small open economy and return to being export driven.Deputy Bruton referred to the jobs initiative.  At least something is on the table but I question its narrow focus.  We have a large services sector in this country.  People are losing their jobs and we need to consider how a rising tide can lift all boats.  It appears the baby is in agreement with Fine Gael policy.

It is my understanding that the IMF will refer to the same.  On average, the Minister is projecting a GNP growth rate of 2.9%.  That is extremely optimistic.  In the report for 10 March on the Irish stability programme, the European Council concluded that the budgetary targets are subject to downside risks throughout the programme period due to a lack of information on the envisaged measures to support the planned consolidation and the growth assumptions that underline the macroeconomic scenarios.I raised the next matter in committee but I will raise it again.  The Council established a deadline of 24 October for the Government to take effective action on measures to achieve the 2009 deficit target and the specification of the necessary measures to progress towards the correction of the excessive deficit.  The ball is back in the Minister's court.

We must deal with the issue on the basis of realistic targets.  The Minister must broaden the focus on job creation and job protection to the wider economy, not just specifically internationally traded services and manufacturing.  Those areas are vital but we must deal with all jobs.  We must get the banking sector lending again.  The Minister must address concerns about NAMA and assure us that it will provide a flow of funds.  That point has not been addressed.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The Minister for Finance is given to having soaring rhetoric at the end of his speeches.  One recalls his standing ovation following last October's budget.  He said at the end of today's speech, "There are no soft options or safe hiding places.  The time has now come..."  In terms of the Budget Statement, there were soft options and hiding places.  The Minister was the person who took them, to the considerable discredit of politics and public service in this country.I refer specifically to the keynote part of the Minister's speech, which addressed the issue of reform on areas such as serving Deputies who are former Ministers and are in receipt of ministerial pensions.  The Minister laid out as a critical part of his budget architecture that if sacrifices and contributions were required from all sectors, they would be led by people at the top of the public service and office holders structure.  One of the difficulties with this country is that the Minister failed abjectly to deliver on that.When the debate took place on salaries for members of the Judiciary the Minister might recall that I suggested to him he should include in the legislation a scheme that would be available to the Judiciary.  I recall asking the Minister who in the Judiciary would take such a scheme to court.  If that were to happen, a previous Supreme Court ruling should have given the Minister fair wind.  What concerns me is that the Minister talked the talk but he did not deliver.  That has been his continuous theme as an officeholder.In the brief time available to me, I wish to mention the banking crisis because, again, in his speech the Minister referred to us being subject to international factors.  It is long past the time that Fianna Fáil in particular recognised that so much of the Irish banking crisis was completely home-grown.  It was stimulated by the party's policies and inflated by the policies of the Government and the Minister's predecessors.  That is at the core of the damage our economy has suffered.  Part of that damage is reputational damage.  The Minister has done relatively little other than talking a lot of rhetoric about how he will solve the problem.  He has done little to address the problems in a serious way that players, whether they be in the United States or the city of London, would say the problem in Ireland has been addressed.The core of the problem with the banking crisis is that there is a general belief that the golden circle of the politically connected, the bankers and the developers still influence every step of the resolution of our banking crisis.  Perhaps only when there is a change of Government and that pervasive influence is no longer there, will our reputation be fully restored.  One can ask why that is important.  This is important because the banking crisis and overall financial position are at the core of our unemployment crisis.  All the commentators are talking freely about unemployment rising to 16% by this time next year.  The Minister and his colleagues in Government have not put sufficient thought into what a rate of 16% would entail.  I was a Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare when Deputy Michael Woods was Minister, at which time the unemployment rate was 18%.  One really needs to think outside the box to get the unemployed back into the workforce, education and training.The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is offering what is essentially a hopeless alternative.  He knows from our shared constituency that it takes two or three months before those who become unemployed, particularly those who were self-employed, can register with the different agencies.  Consequently, what otherwise might be a short-term gap in employment becomes much longer, particularly where those affected are young, male and not particularly well educated.  The biggest threat we face is that unemployment will become the norm such that the unemployed will get used to not having a reason to get up in the morning.  The Government does not appreciate the extent of the crisis that is engulfing families right across the country.The Minister made reference to the stimulus programme, which he has included as part of the capital programme in spite of savaging the latter, and referred to the investment in schools.  The investments in stimuli came only after a long campaign by the Labour Party to insist that some employment be retained in the construction industry.  What about the other areas?  In the budget last year, the Minister made a fatal decision to raise the rate of VAT by half a percentage point.  The amount of revenue involved in this increase was neither here nor there in terms of income flow but the increase served as a tipping point based on policy that was basically designed to bolster tax collection and preserve revenue.  However, the policy failed abjectly to account for the likely economic consequences and for how people would behave when the very small 0.5% increase was imposed on them.  They went in droves to the North.What is happening now is like a slow playing out of the rest of the crisis.  At present, there is a price war involving three or four dominant supermarket traders whose gross profit margins are way in excess of those in other EU countries.  In spite of this, the supermarket operators are squeezing the lifeblood out of various sectors, particularly the farming sector and the middle-level retail sector.  The supermarkets are seeking to squeeze the margins of producers in Ireland, be they producers at primary level, such as agricultural producers, or assemblers or packagers, to the point that they cannot continue to operate.  Perhaps the stabilisation package announced today will help some of those operators in addition to those trading abroad.  However, there is no doubt that what the Minister set in motion when he sent people to the North to shop has caused a series of structural faults in various sectors of the Irish economy, with the effect that we are bleeding jobs.  This means the Minister, for the period during which he remains in office, must come up with fresh ideas.  If this means he must accept those of the Labour Party, we will welcome it.  At least he will be taking some action.Let us consider the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  For the next couple of months, I would prefer if some of the Ministers refrained from public debate.  In the United States, people take a holiday at times from the high summer season up to Labour Day at the beginning of September.  Ultimately, when the people vote on the treaty, the key question they will have in mind will be whether it will help them and their families to keep their jobs.  They will ask whether it will help them to be part of a bigger European economy and sustain them.Some of the issues that dominated the debate before the last referendum on the treaty will be replaced by very simple bread-and-butter questions.  If the Government wants the involvement of Ireland in the European Union to continue to the fullest extent possible, it must give a message of hope.  In part, this would involve acknowledging the mistakes and disasters the Government itself has caused for the economy and employment.

It is a mere formality because we did not really have an opportunity to tease out the detail of all the departmental programmes.  Even if we had, it would probably have been rather pointless because the Government, as usual, would not have listened to us in any event.  However, the debate does confirm for us the Government's continuing two-pronged approach to the economic crisis we are facing.  On the one hand, it involves, as a top priority, bailing out the banks regardless of the cost, be it to the tune of €440 billion or whatever it takes.  On the other hand, it involves cutbacks for those who can least afford them.  The latter include pensioners and others who have had their Christmas bonuses cut.  Key public services for such people have been cut right across the board and some of these are the subject of debate before the House at present.  This is the Government's strategy to date and it needs to change.Many economists have cautioned against this approach.  The Minister has obviously been reading their remarks.

They have told the Minister on many occasions that what he needs to do is introduce a stimulus package to retain and create jobs and get people back to work.  However, the Minister is ignoring them and listening to his friends, the fat cats and developers, which is the wrong approach.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I believed there was a new development when I heard the announcement yesterday evening that the Minister is putting what sounds like a €250 million fund in place for job retention.  If so, I welcome it warmly.  I have not heard any details about it but I hope it is modelled on a proposal such as the one my party made to the Minister in March before the April budget.  We advocate that a fund of €300 million, to be administered by Enterprise Ireland, be made available over a six-month period with a view to retaining jobs.  We propose that the subsidy that would apply to each job in viable businesses requiring assistance would amount to a maximum of €200 or 20% of an employee's salary.I hope this is being proposed by the Minister.  However, there are a couple of difficulties, one of which is that we do not have any detail.  For how long will the €250 million fund be made available?  Will it be for six or 12 months?  We advocate a six-month pilot project to allow us to see what is happening.  This would save in the order of 90,000 jobs.  This would be good for the economy, keep the bicycle upright, serve as a stimulus and encourage people to make investments.  However, we have heard no details of the Minister's scheme.We now hear about a package worth €1 billion.  I am concerned that this may partly be to keep the social partnership talks ticking over.  Why would the Minister mention a fund worth €1 billion and not give us any details thereon?  Can he understand why I am suspicious?  We heard announcements of funds from the Government before but in many cases they were re-announcements.  It is not unusual to hear this Government re-announce something three or four times, without giving detail.  It is really bluff and bluster.  That causes us major concern.  Is this a genuine announcement?  Will the Minister tell us when he will give us details of the scheme?  The one feature missing from Government policy is job retention and creation.  We have not had a stimulus package to get the economy going.  The Government has been silent on this.  Will the Minister please give us any details he can of this scheme?  I welcome what I have heard.  I want to be positive about it.  I hope the Minister has taken account of all the details of my proposal but I do not care whose proposal it is.  It is more important than that.The Minister has shown no interest whatsoever in protecting jobs.  He has had several opportunities, from October last year to April of this year and many announcements between.  All of this has been going on while 200,000 people have lost their jobs in the past 12 months.  I hope that when the Minister responds in a few moments he will shed some light on this and give us something we can all support.The big project for Government policy has been for the bankers and bailing out the speculators.  That is what the National Asset Management Agency will do.  I look forward to the debate on that in September.  Unfortunately, it will probably trundle through the House with the support of the voting fodder on the backbenches.The Minister has told us over the past few days that he is acting in the public interest and that we have to make tough decisions.  The Government is not acting in the public interest but in the interest of a small group of people.  It has not taken tough decisions but soft, easy decisions that do not deal with the real crisis.  It has been making the wrong decisions.  That is what has got us where we are.  We know all about that.  It has nationalised Anglo Irish Bank and issued a blanket guarantee to the other banks.  This is aimed at a very narrow sector.  It is not fair to use taxpayers' hard-earned money to bail out that category of people.In his April budget the Minister announced 400 extra community employment places.  Those places could be taken up between two towns.  Kildare and Navan, or Dundalk and Drogheda, or any couple of towns would easily have taken up 200 places each.   Some towns would probably take up all 400.  It is a ridiculous number to offer across the State.  He also announced a ten-week training scheme.  Many of us see that as bluff and bluster.  It is squashing down courses that are already there, doing paperwork to put more people through to make it look as if the Government is doing something.I would encourage the Minister if he wants to do something constructive, to use some funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, for example, in an enthusiastic roll-out of a school building project.  That would help the construction sector, particularly if the Minister changes the rules to allow contracts to be segmented so that smaller developers could get some of that action and employ people from towns to get them back to work and get the economy moving again.  I do not see that happening.In his speech today the Minister said: "These Estimates reflect the necessary albeit difficult expenditure measures taken by the Government over the last year while protecting as much as possible vital front line services."  Would the Minister forgive me for thinking that he is not protecting vital front line services?  The motion for Private Member's business last night and this evening put down by Fine Gael outlines that failure in the closure of wards and a theatre in a children's hospital.  There is no efficiency there.  These children must be dealt with in any event.  An accountant would tell the Minister that it will cost more to deal with them in the long run.  It would be more efficient to deal with the injuries and other medical difficulties these children have now rather than doing five or six procedures or major surgery later.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  The Government is pointing in the wrong direction.  I wish the Minister would sometimes listen to the Opposition parties and some economists and evaluate what they are saying and stop listening to the fat cats and the corrupt bankers because they are leading the Government and the State in the wrong direction.  It needs to change and be turned around.  I hope it can be turned around soon.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	526	I thank the Deputies for contributing to the debate and facilitating the approval of the Revised Estimates for the public services.  It is important to note that the output statements are a major step forward.  The OECD recognised that last year in its report on the Irish public service which commended the output statements as the right way forward for performance-based budgeting in Ireland.  The OECD noted in particular that Ireland was on a sound trajectory of modernisation in that regard.  I am glad to see that endorsement but I am open to suggestions from the Opposition parties about how we can improve the exercise of deliberative choice in the whole area of expenditure.  As the reports of the Commission on Taxation and the special group on public expenditure numbers become available I will examine the working papers of these reports to establish whether they can be made available so that we can have as informed a debate as possible about how to tackle the crisis we face.In my official script this evening the line is inserted — "I think we all agree about the magnitude of the task facing us in rebalancing the public finances."  After listening to this debate I am not sure that we do all agree about the magnitude of that task.  Not a single speaker opposite mentioned it, although I accept that they have mentioned it on occasion.  In this debate on the Revised Estimates, however, I do not think we agree about the magnitude of the task facing us in rebalancing the public finances.  Deputy Morgan, and occasionally Deputy Burton, consistently confuse the banking crisis with the public finance crisis.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	532	Let us assume that we have no banking crisis.  We must and constantly do discuss that in this House.  I am not taking away from that fact.  Even without the banking crisis we would still have a substantial public finance crisis because the volume of our expenditure is at unsustainable levels.  Our taxation receipts fell to unsustainable levels.  That problem exists independent of any banking crisis.  It is a problem which any Government will have to address.Telling the citizens that they must pay a pension levy to fund the banks or the mistakes made by bankers is simply incorrect.  It is wrong.  That is not why the pension levy was introduced.  It was introduced to rebalance the public finances.  Until we recognise that, that our day-to-day expenditure is being funded by borrowing and that on the current account of the State expenditure we must fund it through borrowing, our discussions in this House will make no progress because that means that we must adjust our expectations and expenditure accordingly.  I look forward to the publication of the reports of the Commission on Taxation and the McCarthy group which will inform expenditure and taxation decisions.I said in my budget speech, and most Members will agree, that in considering expenditure and taxation figures in the next few months we must view the targeted figures for taxation in the next budget as the maximum and the figures for expenditure as a minimum.  Deputy Bruton alleged that I took the soft option in the supplementary budget in April.  I did not take the soft option but I brought income tax to the highest level possible consistent with the security of the economy.  That had to be done because our income tax receipts fell to unacceptable levels.  We had to plug that hole in our revenue base and we did so.  However, there are definite restrictions on how much more of this we can do and it is clear that if we are to make further adjustments they will have to be on the expenditure side.  That is the entire position of our expenditure and taxation.We have fundamental decisions to make this year to maintain the country on a sustainable basis.  We must ensure the passage of the Lisbon treaty, which was discussed in the House earlier today, and I welcome the constructive approach taken by the Opposition parties in that regard.  We must examine the NAMA legislation and I will be most anxious that in advance of any parliamentary debate on this matter it will be debated fully at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  We will also have to formulate a budget that complies with our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact.  All of that lies ahead of us during the next seven months.  These are important decisions for the country.  The Opposition must hold us to account but it must also face up to the reality of the position in which this country finds itself.We can argue about whether the causes are domestic or international but it is clear that a huge international component is involved when one is dealing with a small globalised economy such as Ireland.  That has been recognised by all of the commentators who have examined the position in Ireland and the decisions the Government has had to take and who, by and large, have supported the approach taken by the Government.A fiscal contraction of 5% of GDP is not an easy route and when Deputy Bruton speaks about value for money does he refer to all public expenditure or to a few select items of public expenditure to which he consistently refers in public discourse?  If one seeks value for money on the totality of public expenditure then one cannot exempt any head or subhead of expenditure from one's consideration.  I understand the position of the Opposition parties but that is what the Government will have to do during the coming months.Deputy Burton referred to the crucial issue of changes to the remuneration of Deputies and Senators.  There will be a 10% reduction in all expenses and I am preparing the relevant statutory instrument.  A 25% reduction has taken place in mileage rates.  Deputies will no longer receive long service payments or increments.  They will be abolished from the next election and an immediate 25% reduction has been made on the advice of the Attorney General and it is not open to the Government to vary or depart from the advice of an Attorney General.  The ministerial pension arrangements will be discontinued from the next election with an immediate 25% reduction.  The question of teachers' pay is being addressed, the allowances are being halved, the payments to Whips and committee Vice Chairmen are to be abolished and the various proposals of the Oireachtas commission on expenses are under consideration and will be implemented over the summer.All of those measures will be implemented and, more fundamentally, the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector is undertaking a fresh review of top-level pay rates.  That will be crucial, along with the other two reports, in informing the thinking of the budget this year.

The Government decided to bring forward these amendments to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 in order to address the difficulties in the operation of the Mental Health Act 2001.  The need to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 arises from the recent High Court proceedings where a patient sought and was granted a declaration that her removal to a psychiatric hospital was not in accordance with section 13(2) of that Act.The 2001 Act provides for the involuntary admission to approved centres of persons suffering from mental disorders.  In addition, the legislation provides that where a person is acutely mentally ill and requires admission to hospital, but is unwilling to travel to hospital voluntarily, the person can be brought to the hospital.  Section 13(2) of the 2001 Act places a statutory obligation on the clinical director of the approved centre to provide such assisted missions, where necessary using staff from the approved centre.Is further clarification needed?

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I have a problem with the manner in which this has been introduced, but not with addressing the issue.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I object to the way in which this is being introduced.  We were given these amendments yesterday.  The substantial amendment, amendment No. 6, amends the Mental Health Act 2001.  I went back to my file on the Mental Health Act 2001 and found that substantial concerns were raised by, for example, the National Disability Authority, Schizophrenia Ireland and a number of other organisations in respect of the human rights element and protection required in the Mental Health Act 2001.  There may well be a problem with the detention of people who need to be brought back into care, but this is not the way to do it.We need to have an opportunity to consult with the various bodies which had concerns about that Act previously.  We are now reducing the protection through what is being done today.  In the original legislation, the staff of the institution were allowed to get the assistance of the Garda Síochána if they had to bring somebody back who had, for example, absconded.  That is provided for in the original legislation, which I have here with me.  However, what we are doing now is providing for an authorised person to do that.There may well be a good reason for this and the Minister of State may be able to cite the details of the situation which I understand has occurred.  This, however, is not the way to do it.  As legislators, we have an obligation to go back and consult the various bodies that had a concern about the legislation originally, if it is being substantially amended.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I have the same issue.  As a general practitioner I understand the difficulties.  I understand the difficulty that arises when a patient is deeply psychotic in the middle of the night and one is trying to get that person into a safe place for care.  I understand too the difficulty with staff having to come from the hospital to address this and the related problems.  I understand also that another group of individuals with a history of being involved in psychiatric care, psychiatric nurses, have sought to address this through a body they have set up.However, the main issue is that this Bill has nothing to do with the Bill we were discussing.  The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is on the Government legislative programme proposes to dissolve the National Council on Ageing and Older People and the Women's Health Council to subsume the National Cancer Screening Service Board, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and the Drug Treatment Centre Board into the HSE and to amend the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 to remove age limits for travel insurance benefit provided in accordance with that Act.  We have gone through three Stages of this Bill and now, suddenly, on Report Stage, the Mental Health Act is introduced.  That is totally unsatisfactory.There was no discourse before this was done.  We got no advisory brief and no rationale for this decision.  It was just done.  We, on this side of the House, would like to be co-operative in addressing the serious issues that afflict the day-to-day running of our service and the care of patients, but this is no way to go about it.

They only appeared yesterday on the publication of Report Stage.  They amount to a separate Bill and should have had a separate explanatory memorandum.  We should have been given the opportunity to properly discuss and debate the measures involved that clearly affect not only the Mental Health Act 2001, but all the way through to 2009.There has been no briefing on the net effect of the measures now appended to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009.  This an outrageous way to do business.  These important matters require proper scrutiny in the House, whether they are right or wrong or whether we come to an agreement that they are required.  The way the business is being conducted is the most vexatious aspect of the situation.I understand this is being done on the advice of the Attorney General.  His opinions are under considerable contest at the present time, particularly with regard to judges and pension levies.  Therefore, he may not have a monopoly of wisdom on this matter either and could well be wrong.  While I do not link the two matters, Deputies, nevertheless, have a right to make it clear that the Attorney General is not infallible.  These matters should have been properly addressed in a separate Bill with a separate explanatory memorandum.  The issue should have been addressed in the House in that way.

The proposal before us is whether to recommit these amendments to Committee Stage.  The question as to whether the amendments are acceptable to Members is a different matter and goes to the substance.  The Bill, as its Title suggests, is a miscellaneous Bill, the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009.  Therefore, the amendments are in order.  I want to advise Members on the issue because it is important.  The issue is whether the Members wish to consider these amendments, and reject or accept them as may be, in Committee — in other words, there would be no limits — or that we discuss them on Report.  If we discuss them on Report Stage, Members know the rules.  The person who moves the amendment has a right of reply, but the intervening contribution can only be two minutes and no Member may speak more than twice.Would Members prefer to discuss them on Committee, giving them a greater opportunity to discuss the amendments and then seek to vote them down if necessary?  I am in the hands of the Members.  I can put the question or can proceed on Committee if Members accept that.

I accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling and understand that from a technical perspective he is right.  However, he must agree that any reasonable person would be misled by this.  I believe we should put this to a vote now, because this should not be done.

In page 5, line 16, after "1997," to insert "THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT 2001,".By way of clarification, I take the points made by Deputies Reilly and O'Sullivan.  I can understand Deputy Reilly's point about separating mental health from the other health issues generally.  However, the complaint is the fact that it is rushed legislation.  A full review of the Mental Health Act will be undertaken in 2011.  I sincerely accept the point Deputy Reilly made, but the timing is dictated by High Court findings and this was the earliest opportunity before the summer recess to deal with the matter.  I can assure the Deputy I did not get advice to rush anything in and I accept the point he made on whether the mental health legislation should be taken separately, but as there is a time constraint I have no choice but to do it.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	564	The 2001 Act provides for the involuntary admission to approved centres of persons suffering from mental disorders and, in addition, the legislation provides that where a person is acutely mentally ill and requires admission to hospital but is unwilling to travel to hospital voluntarily, he or she may be brought to the hospital.  Section 13(2) of the 2001 Act places a statutory obligation on the clinical director of the approved centre to provide such assisted admissions, where necessary, using staff of the approved centre.In the case referred to, a patient had been removed to a psychiatric hospital in April 2007 by the external agency contracted by the HSE to provide assisted admissions, where they could not be provided by the local service.  We must deal with the issue of what constitutes staff of the approved centre, which was the subject of the judicial review proceedings.  In his ruling, the judge found that the meaning of the term "member of staff" is confined to an individual and a corporate entity such as an external agency could not be a member of staff.  This narrow interpretation of the term "staff of the approved centre" presents difficulties in the ongoing provision of an assisted admissions service.In 2008, of the 2,004 involuntary admissions, 604 were assisted admissions, of which 42%, or 250, were provided by an external agency.  All the assisted admissions in the Dublin and Leinster region were provided by the external agency.  I am satisfied that the external agency has provided a very professional, high quality and safe assisted admissions service for the HSE and the two private psychiatric hospitals since 2006.  To date, more than 600 people have been safely brought to the hospital by the agency and there have been no complaints about the service during the period, which is noteworthy when one considers the sensitive and potentially difficult nature of the service.The provision of the assisted admissions by a central agency enables the development of specialised expertise in the de-escalation of difficult situations, which is of immense value and ultimately makes the situation easier for the patient and his or her family.  The company involved employs only fully qualified psychiatric nurses, all of whom receive intensive specialised training, including appropriate interactions with service users and training on de-escalation and talk-down techniques.  The company complies with all mental health commission guidelines and standards in its work.  It also provides special transport with trained drivers and co-operates effectively with the Garda Síochána when its assistance is required.To bring clarity to the purpose of the amendment, to ensure the continuation of externally-provided assisted admissions the amendment is necessary to ensure that acutely mentally ill persons who require hospitalisation and refuse to come to hospital voluntarily can be brought to hospital by specially authorised persons, where the local service is not in a position to provide the necessary assisted admissions.  Otherwise, we will have a situation where an assisted admission service will not be available uniformly country wide and as a result vulnerable people in need of treatment will be left in the community when they should have been admitted to hospitalBy way of dealing with amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and amendment No. 6, as proposed by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, I would like to discuss each of the amendments in the first grouping, that is, amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and amendment No. 6, if that is in order.Amendment No. 6 provides for changes to the Mental Health Act 2001 in order to ensure the continuation of externally provided assisted admissions.  It is proposed to amend sections 13 and 27 of the 2001 Act to provide that a clinical director can arrange for a person to be removed or returned to the approved centre by members of staff of the approved centre or by authorised persons. The amendment provides that the registered proprietor of an approved centre may enter into a contract for the purposes of arranging externally assisted admissions.  Persons who are employed by the external agency will then be authorised in writing by the clinical director to provide assisted admissions to his or her particular approved centre.  It is proposed to amend section 9(2) of the Mental Health Act 2001 to disqualify authorised persons from making an application to detain a person under the Act and thus ensure that no conflict of interest can arise.A question has arisen as to whether assisted admissions by the external agency to date are valid.  Counsel has advised that the Legislature has the power to ratify previous breaches of sections 13 and 27 and in these circumstances, and for the avoidance of doubt, a validation provision is included in the amendment to confirm all external agency assisted admissions to date.Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related to amendment No. 6.  Amendment No. 1 amends the Long Title of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill so that it encompasses the amendment to the Mental Health Act made in the Bill.  Amendment No. 2 provides that the Mental Health Acts 2001 and 2008 and section 62 may be cited together as the Mental Health Acts 2001 to 2009, and shall be construed together as one.  Reference to section 62 in this instance is a reference to the new section to be included in the Bill, in line with amendment No. 6.Amendment No. 2 also provides that the Health Acts 1947 to 2008 and section 62 may be cited together as the Health Acts 1947 to 2009, and shall be construed together as one.  This is a reference to section 62 of the Bill as it stands printed at present, and refers to an amendment to the Health Act 2007.  This new citation and construction for the current section 62 arose from proposals made by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan on Committee Stage, for which I am grateful to her.In addition, amendment No. 2 provides that the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, when enacted, other than section 62, shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint, by order or orders, either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision, and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or different provisions.  Again, the reference to section 62 in this instance is to the proposed new section under amendment No. 6.  This is required because the intention is that this new section is to come into operation as soon as the legislation is enacted.As amendment No. 3 put forward by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is encompassed in amendment No. 2, I do not propose to accept it.  I would again like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter on Committee Stage.  I commend the amendments to the House.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	565	I thank the Minister of State for taking on board the point I made in amendment No. 3, which I will withdraw on that basis.  The main points I wish to make are in regard to amendment No. 6 and the alteration and amendment of the Mental Health Act 2001.We have already expressed alarm, as I did this morning on the Order of Business, in regard to the recommittal and this way of amending legislation.  I searched back and found my file on the Mental Health Act 2001 and found I had received representations on the legislation from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Schizophrenia Ireland, the National Disability Authority and possibly other organisations whose records I have not kept.  A White Paper was published in advance of that legislation, so there was clearly much discussion around the balance of rights, because there is a very sensitive balance of rights in regard to the detention of people who have a psychiatric illness and who may be a danger to themselves and others.  We are all realistic enough to know there are situations where people have to be detained for their own good.  However, it is a balance of rights, which is the point that concerns me here.I have not had a chance to consult with anyone in advance of this debate because we received the list of amendments only yesterday and it was this morning before I had an opportunity to fully read the amendment.  In the original Mental Health Act of 2001, there was a provision under section 13 and the other section referred to, section 27, in regard to the removal of persons to approved centres.  Section 13(3) of that Act states:Where the clinical director of the approved centre or a consultant psychiatrist acting on his or her behalf and the registered medical practitioner who made the recommendation are of opinion that there is a serious likelihood of the person concerned causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons, the clinical director or a consultant psychiatrist acting on his or her behalf may, if necessary, request the Garda Síochána to assist the members of the staff of the approved centre in the removal by the staff of the person to that centre and the Garda Síochána shall comply with any such request.There was concern among some of the organisations about definitions of, for example, an authorised person and who that person should be.  The assistance of the Garda Síochána could already be sought, and gardaí were obliged under the law to comply with the request for assistance, so there was already a fairly tight system whereby a person could be detained and brought back to the approved centre.  We need a far better explanation as to why that legislation is inadequate and why we need new legislation.It is a matter of balancing rights.  People in these organisations are genuinely concerned that there may be an over-heavy hand in some situations.  While I accept that in the majority of situations the person does need to be detained, it is a very fine line and one on which, as legislators, we need to tread carefully.The "authorised person" is defined in the amendment.  Although the Minister of State claims they will be qualified people, I see nothing in the legislation that describes exactly what kind of person can be authorised.  Must they have a particular professional qualification or be a particular kind of person?  Is there a loophole whereby these centres could take on anybody who is physically strong enough to detain these persons and bring them back to the authorised centre?These are the concerns I have with the legislation.  It is an important duty on us, as legislators, to protect the public in these kinds of situations and to make sure we are not leaving loopholes or gaps in legislation that could affect people's civil liberties and human rights at a later stage.  I am concerned that the definition of an authorised person appears quite loose.  It appears the registered proprietor of the centre can pretty much decide who the authorised person should be.  In the Act of 2001, there were much tighter controls over who could or could not remove a person who needed to be brought back to a centre.Has there been a problem with the Garda Síochána assisting where necessary?  Generally, if somebody needs to be detained, for whatever reason, the Garda Síochána is the organisation which is used to doing that kind of thing, and it is controlled in turn by codes of practice that have been tightened up over the years.  Checks and balances are in place, with a Garda Ombudsman giving the public a place they can go if they feel they are not being properly treated.  Another one of the suggestions in this legislation is that there should be advocates for the people concerned but, again, I do not see any reference to this in the amendments.My concerns are purely concerned with ensuring we protect the rights of the individuals concerned and that we do not, in our haste, enact legislation that turns out not to protect the public as it should.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	566	Likewise, while I accept there is a serious issue that has to be dealt with, I am concerned that rushed legislation will be poor legislation which we will have to revisit.  I too am concerned that, despite telephone calls, I have not been able to consult with the sort of people I would like to have been able to consult, such as the Mental Health Coalition.  I know my colleague, Deputy Dan Neville, tried to contact Amnesty International to obtain its view on the Bill.  Nobody was aware of the manner in which this legislation would be presented to us, but I am sure the Psychiatric Nurses Association, Schizophrenia Ireland and other consumer groups would have a view.  This is what makes me nervous about taking this legislation without having had time to examine it fully.A couple of obvious questions spring to mind.  Naturally, as a GP, I am only too well aware of the difficulties that present, particularly at night.  In one experience I had as a young doctor, I arrived at a house and was asked whether I was the garda, such was the situation — I will not go into the details but a weapon was certainly involved and it was not a nice situation to be presented with, although it worked out to the good in the end.  The Garda Síochána is fully committed but its members are under a great deal of pressure, although we will not go into the broader political talk of how the country is rife with crime and gangland killings.  Gardaí cannot always get to a scene in a timely fashion and, while there is a certain attractiveness in what the Minister of State says, like Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I would have grave reservations about regulation.  The current individuals concerned may be of the highest calibre but there appears to be no proper regulation, no regular inspections or a proper selection process from an independent body such as HIQA, Health Information Quality Authority.  These companies could change hands and different people could be employed from those originally in place.Have all these people been vetted by the Garda?  Have they all been trained in matters of hygiene?  Have they all been trained in restraint?  The Minister of State mentioned the need for staff to sometimes talk a patient down.  Are these people trained in counselling techniques and how to deal with high-energy, disturbed behaviour?  Are there standards for the vehicles such people will use?  Are there standard instructions for how often they should be cleaned after use by someone who, for example, may have been covered in blood or who may have become incontinent?  All such issues must be addressed by standards which apply to this or any other agency used for the purpose of protecting patients.Currently there is no regulation of the ambulance services whether public or private.  I am in receipt of knowledge today of a situation in which one private ambulance operator took over another only to find some 20 people in the operation had never been vetted by the Garda and that the inspections carried out had been of a very cursory nature.  If a firm has 100 employees and it claims they have all been vetted it is easy to check this by counting 100 forms vetted by the Garda.  However, it is possible for a firm to state it has only 20 employees and produce 20 forms while in practice employing 100 people.  There are so many loopholes at present that I could call for the regulation of ambulances to be addressed under the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill too.  We must have such regulation if outside agencies or bodies are to be used.  I caution that some two or three weeks of this session remain and we could revert to this section and allow time for consultation with interested groups.  That would ensure we would not find ourselves returning to the whole Bill because people expressed serious concerns.  We may do our best but such people would have a greater knowledge of these areas and may recognise problems we cannot see.I wish to raise the serious and important issue of the need for the Irish Medicines Board to address and assess medical devices that come to the market.  The former Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, has alluded to this matter in the past.  I realise this is slightly off the point but the medical devices industry is worth €6 billion, representing 9% of our exports, and it employs some 26,500 people.  It has the advantage of access to the European market.  If the board is efficient such that it can assess devices rapidly and get them to the market it confers a very significant opportunity to grow the industry.However, there is not enough staff in the Irish Medicines Board.  I trust the recruitment ban will not interfere with such an important industry.  Having said that I do not wish in any way to demean the issue of mental health or the need to regulate the sector and the agency we propose to put in place.  Unless the Minister can include the amendments there is no way I could vote for the amendment, although I recognise it is badly needed and a significant issue exists in this case.  However, I do not wish to fall into the trap of rushed legislation leading to bad legislation and more problems later on.  I believe the Minister of State has no wish to find himself in the courts again and nor do any of us.

Are such agencies registered and, if so, with whom do such bodies register?  If these agencies are in situ, who is being recruited to perform these roles?  We are discussing externally assisted involuntary admissions by those not directly employed by the HSE or members of the Garda.  Such people operate in the private sector.  This is a form of privatisation in terms of the placing of people within psychiatric institutions involuntarily.  What are the determinants for qualification as an authorised person?  What oversight applies to the conduct of such authorised persons?  What steps are in place to ensure authorised persons throughout the jurisdiction act in accordance with the highest standards?  Have such standards been laid down anywhere and, if so, where have they been laid down and by what mechanism?I refer to the amendments bounced on us by the Minister of State, the fact that there has been such a degree of urgency and that these measures could not have been taken independently of the Bill.  Is there a legal challenge in train or in preparation of which the Minister of State, the Department or the HSE is aware that has given rise to the rushed introduction of these amendments?  There have been precedents involving the Minister for Health and Children.  What exactly has given rise to the introduction of these amendments with such speed and such a determination to refuse to accommodate proper scrutiny and real engagement with all the various interested parties to which other Deputies have already alluded and with whom I also have an excellent working relationship?  I would appreciate an answer to all these questions but especially a clear answer to my last question.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	568	I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution.  I was involved in the passage of the 2001 Act along with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  It was a tortuous process because of the level of consultation and discussion with the then Minister and the level of concern expressed throughout, but especially on Committee Stage.  The introduction of this section in one fell swoop is of great concern because of that previous experience and the concerns expressed at that time.I recall clearly at that time the concerns expressed regarding the changes the then Minister proposed.  As with the two previous speakers, I will endeavour to obtain advice on this matter because I am not in a position to technically evaluate fully the implications of the measures in respect of the rights of people.  There are experts in this area who have advised us in the past but we have not had the opportunity to consult appropriately.  I am concerned that the Opposition is not empowered to fully comprehend the implications of the measures because we have not had the opportunity to do so.Who will be authorised to do this work?  No criteria are laid down regarding how to select people or an organisation.  Will the work involve security people, a bouncer's organisation or someone heavy handed enough to handle people?  What training is necessary and what criteria has been laid down?  If criteria had been laid down for the selection of people it would alleviate our concerns with the Bill, but it has not been included.  Why is the detail in this area so vague such that the Minister of State has not included criteria for the selection of people to carry out the removal of people?  We have encountered very serious situations in which people must be restrained for their own sake and for the sake of others.  Some very serious events have taken place regarding the safety of professional clinicians who have had to deal with certain situations.  I know of an unfortunate situation in Limerick where life was seriously endangered.  We recognise there must be some level of intervention with respect to people with difficulties but the concerns expressed on Committee Stage in 2001 are still relevant.  When that Bill was being taken in the Oireachtas at the time, I do not remember if this was one of the many issues we raised.The introduction of a separate Bill would have been an opportunity to discuss the whole area of mental health and mental health services.  We have been seeking a comprehensive debate on the independent monitoring group's report which expressed concerns about the absence of identifiable leadership in the implementation of the recommendations of A Vision for Change.  The group expressed concerns that a more comprehensive plan had not been put in place to implement those recommendations.  The group was very disappointed with the slow rate of progress in the implementation of the recommendations.  A Vision for Change cannot be implemented effectively without a national mental health service directorate and from private discussions with the Minister, I understand there may be some moves in this regard.  It is hoped these will not be delayed.The group recommended a dedicated leader at senior and national level and this absence has impeded progress in the implementation of the recommendations.  The group said this was contributing to the continuing poor facilities and standards of care in some areas and an inconsistent approach in embedding the recovery services for people with psychiatric illnesses.  It would have been an opportunity to discuss this matter.I have been endeavouring to raise a matter on the Adjournment on the subject of the report on St. Luke's Hospital in Clonmel.  This was as serious as many of the reports that have been debated at length in the House but it will not be afforded the same status as some of the other reports into serious matters which have been debated here in the past six months.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the recommendation that the hospital be closed.  There are very serious allegations about fractures not being identified for some time after they occurred; sensitive and frail patients being in close proximity to patients who are more aggressive and concerns about the safety of patients.  I am very disappointed that the same rigour has not been applied to the Minister of State's amendment as was applied to the original Bill in 2001.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  I intend to deal in rotation with all the points raised but I wish to clarify a point made by the second last speaker, Deputy Ó Caoláin who quite properly asked if this Bill is in advance of some court challenge.  I wish to inform him that this is not the case.  This is not a matter of trying to protect against issues coming down the line.I will deal with the issues raised by Deputies.  I fully agree with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan that it is a matter of balancing rights and this should be fundamental to any change in legislation, particularly legislation which clearly in some instances was introduced in a hurry.  I accept that point and I wish to apologise to the House that consultations between the Whips or the party spokespersons did not occur in the past few days.  However, I refer to the time constraints as the House rises for the summer recess in two weeks.  I do not use this as an excuse. I also refer to the fallout from the High Court judgment.I take the points made by Deputies Reilly and Jan O'Sullivan regarding the safeguards in the vetting procedures.  I take the point made by Deputy Ó Caoláin about privatisation.  I listened to Deputy Reilly who is a GP and he referred to the issues of basic cleanliness of ambulances and the expertise of staff.  All these matters will be dealt with by way of HSE protocols.  I acknowledge that "protocol" is a loose word and it may be suggested that they only last for varying periods of time but the test of their validity will have to be in the criteria they will set down for employees.I take into account the fear of changes in the mental health legislation because of possible future implications.  I do not say this as an excuse but up to now there has been a difficulty in securing professional people to assist with involuntary patients.  The use of external agencies is not just a matter of convenience.  All personnel must comply with the mental health commission guidelines.  Even as I say this, I accept that guidelines are one thing but it is a question of how strong the guidelines in the protocol will be.  The guidelines and the protocols brought forward by the HSE will need to ensure that all the necessary prerequisites are in place and the most obvious would have to be the vetting procedures.  Assurances will be required from external companies along with Garda security and background clearance, and with the experience of such staff in dealing with mentally ill patients.  These would have to be included in the protocol.I made the point in my contribution that there must be compliance with the guidelines of the mental health commission.  The requirement for drivers is that they should work with the Garda Síochána whenever assistance is required.  Protocols will be put in place by the HSE.  The authorised persons will be authorised only for a period of up to 12 months and there will be continuous checking but the vetting procedure has to be put in place in advance.As Deputy Reilly points out, HIQA should have an involvement in preparing the protocols proposed by the HSE and I would expect this to be the case.  Part of its involvement in the protocols should be the vetting of applicants.  I take the point made about ambulances.  I do not wish to deal today with the medical board issue as this is a separate issue.  We must take care when dealing with mental health legislation and in particular when there is a time constraint. I accept that Members have not had an opportunity to check with advisory groups, such as Amnesty International, but I plead with the House to understand the time constraint.  The High Court judgment means that if this matter is not regularised we may find ourselves in a difficulty in the coming months with a person who needs to be transferred involuntarily to a hospital or institution.  We must accept the fact that care staff have been properly trained.  The people who have acted in this capacity have been psychiatric nurses.  No one could act in this capacity if he or she did not have a qualification in mental health support as well as additional training in, for example, talk down techniques and de-escalation.I always read with interest the contributions made by Deputy Neville in this area.  I hope Members do not think this legislation has been bounced upon the House.  We are faced with a severe time constraint.A full review of the Mental Health Act will be undertaken in 2011 when the Act has been in operation for five years.  We will then have an opportunity to tease out these issues.  In the interim, this legislation will prevent people being exposed to harm by themselves or others in cases where the required staff is not available.Deputy Neville requested a debate on mental health.  That will not be possible before the end of the session but I accept his point and I will ask the Government to provide time for such a debate.  Vision for Change is now in the fourth year of a ten year programme.  Huge uncertainty surrounds the funding of mental health supports and the new capital programmes.  Many people have asked what will happen to the capital assets involved in mental health.  I intend to have a public review of Vision for Change during September or October next to reaffirm and establish how we should proceed with the rest of the programme's recommendations and how funding can be secured.  It is no longer enough to talk about ring-fencing funding for mental health.  Legislation must be put before the House to ensure that funding is raised.  These issues should come before the House.  I will support the call for that debate.  I will return to the Clonmel issue, raised by Deputy Neville, at a later date.I am not aware of any further challenges to the High Court ruling.  We need only regularise matters following the ruling.  Statistics for the last year for involuntary referrals in various counties show the widespread use of staff who are not members of SIPTU or the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland, PNA.  It is clear we could not provide the personnel resources for the involuntary transfer of patients.  That is why we need this legislation.  I concede that the Bill is rushed but it arises from the highly principled motive of ensuring that people who cannot care for themselves are cared for by the State.

The implication of what I heard him say is that people who would be recruited to perform these roles and responsibilities would have, at least, the standard of knowledge and training required of professionals within the psychiatric services.  That would be fine, but nothing in the Bill makes it a statutory requirement.  Guidelines are not enough.  There is no clear protocol or definite set of criteria to be met by those responsible for recruiting this personnel.  Can the Minister of State assure us of the standard of person who would carry out this work?  The words "agency" and "agencies" have been used.  Are there agencies currently in existence which offer this service to the health services, and the mental health services specifically?  Do they cover particular areas or regions?  Where they do not exist, what are the current criteria for the recruitment of people to perform these roles?I accept that a High Court decision has been handed down.  Nevertheless, I find it difficult to understand why these amendments had to be pressed today, with such little notice to health spokespersons.  The opportunity properly to inform ourselves to engage in this discussion is seriously impaired.  I hope this precedent will not be repeated.  It is a recipe for very bad decision making and very bad law making.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	573	I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  It appears there is not a registration system and that we will rely on HSE protocols.  The legislation contains no requirement that the people concerned should be in any way professionally qualified.  The Minister of State says he expects they will be and that the kind of people who do this work generally are.  However, the legislation does not require it.  Professionally qualified people are, generally, governed by a regulatory authority of some kind.  Doctors, for example, are governed by the Medical Council and they can be struck off.Generally, if somebody does not act in accordance with the norms and standards expected of them as professionals, there is a consequence.  However, if anybody can do this, there might be no consequence if that person does not behave appropriately in restraining the person concerned.  It is not easy to restrain somebody who does not wish to be restrained.  We are not discussing a situation where somebody just asks a person to come back to a place.  It will probably be fairly physical.  We are obliged to ensure there is proper protection and that the people concerned are appropriate.  This is about a balance of rights and ensuring people's rights are protected.I have looked at the wording of the original Act.  It refers continually to clinical directors, consultant psychiatrists, registered medical practitioners and so forth.  The amendment, however, refers to the registered proprietor of an approved centre.  That is privatisation, in effect.  The proprietor of a public institution is presumably the State, the HSE or the Minister, that is, wherever these institutions are vested.  The amendment uses the term "registered proprietor" and states: "Where the registered proprietor of an approved centre has entered into an arrangement referred to in subsection (1) with a person, the clinical director of that centre may authorise in writing...".  There is a handing down of authority to the clinical director but it is the registered proprietor who makes the agreement with the authorised person to carry out the work of bringing the person back.  Why is that language used in the amendment?  I have seen no reference to registered proprietors in the original Act, which refers consistently to consultant psychiatrists, medical practitioners, registered nurses and staff.  Why are proprietors getting involved rather than clinical directors?I have a problem with being dependent on HSE protocols to ensure this will be done in an appropriate way.  HSE protocols are all very well for some of the issues raised by Deputy James Reilly, such as cleanliness and the like.  However, with regard to a person's behaviour to a very vulnerable individual who is having something done to them that they do not want, that is, being brought back to a centre against their will after absconding from it, it is vital that the person who carries out this work is appropriate, and has appropriate standards.  There must be some type of appropriate redress if it is not done in the right manner.  Under the original Act this is done by clinicians who can get the assistance of the Garda.  My reading of the amended version is that the authorised persons can also get the assistance of the Garda, as in some cases the Act provides for entry of a dwelling or other premises by force if necessary.  I presume the gardaí would do that.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify if these authorised persons can also get the assistance of the Garda and how that will work.There are very real issues here and I am not reassured by the fact that the HSE will introduce protocols.  I do not believe it addresses the human rights elements of this.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	574	Another week will not give rise to tumultuous events.  We could avoid rushing this legislation through and consult with the various bodies that should be consulted.  This is important legislation.  I acknowledge there is an issue and that it must be addressed.  Professionals would acknowledge that as well.  However, input on the needs of patients, as represented through Amnesty International, Schizophrenia Ireland, the Irish Mental Health Coalition and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, would be useful.This is very serious legislation, which gives some people power over other people.  The only people who have that power currently are answerable to the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais.  We are giving this power to an agency, and the legislation does not even contain an amendment providing that these agencies must employ psychiatric nurses for this duty.  It only refers to an agency.  Like Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I noted the use of the word "proprietor" and wondered about its implications.  I also wondered what the current situation is vis-à-vis institutions such as St. John of God Hospital, St. Edmundsbury and so forth where people can be committed by two doctors.  Only doctors can do it, not the proprietor.  Will the proprietor make arrangements with an agency?

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Yes, but the concern is that a private individual who might own an institution for the care of the psychiatrically unwell, run by doctors, may enter into an arrangement with other private individuals who are agents to do this work.  There is a big loophole there, with much room for problems and trouble, if we do not specify the standards in legislation and if it is not regulated by legislation.  There is no regulatory authority to regulate this body or agency involved in this type of work.  That is very important.I also seek clarification on the issue of using whatever force is necessary to gain entry.  That should be restricted to the Garda and not include a private security firm.  We have seen enough of those in the United States of America.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	577	I understand why Members quite properly wish to tease this out.  The agency referred to is known as Nationwide Health Solutions.  It has not come into existence this week but has been operating since 2006.  I confirmed in my earlier response that it depends on protocols.  I understand the worry in that regard.  However, there is only one agency operating in the country.  To remove doubt as to whether people are professionally trained or in a position properly to bring somebody involuntarily to an institution, all the staff involved up to now have been qualified psychiatric nurses.  I accept that the future is the issue.  I do not wish to labour the point but the reason the legislation is before the House is due to the time constraint and the High Court judgment.  More importantly, the HSE on approximately 204 occasions was obliged to use outside agencies to bring in people involuntarily because it did not have the staff required to do so.  It was an attempt to ensure that people who could harm themselves or others could be transferred professionally by people with the appropriate qualifications to do that.The safeguard is the involvement at all times of the Mental Health Commission.  With regard to protocols, the Mental Health Commission will have an involvement and oversight regarding the guidelines to which Nationwide Health Solutions will conform.

In page 4, after line 39, to insert the following:"(c) the targeted, ongoing and repeated photographing of persons for the purposes of monitoring and/or recording the movements, activities and communications of such persons,”.These amendments follow the recommendation of the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, which believes that the Bill's definition of "surveillance" is not exhaustive.  The IHRC has rightly pointed out that, for instance, the use of cameras in public spaces are excluded.  However, it has also stated that the recognition by the European Court of Human Rights that a right to privacy exists to a certain extent in public places must be respected.The IHRC went into detail on why it believes that the targeted, ongoing and repeated photographing of a person for the purpose of monitoring him or her or recording his or her movements, activities and communications via a camera falls under the legislation's description of surveillance.  The IHRC believes that the current description should be extended to cover this type of photography, as it does not always cover the activity desired by the Garda Síochána.  Currently, "surveillance" means monitoring, observing, listening and making recordings of persons.  Photographing adds to existing powers and covers the activities in which the Garda is already involved in many instances.  That evidence can be used in a similar fashion as recorded evidence and the like.The Bill sets out what types of activity can be done, who must authorise them and how they are to be documented.  Accepting my amendment would be useful.  The scope of the Bill is not just to cover the ordinary activity of a member of the Garda Síochána, but, in particular, for the permission required where there is an ongoing and protracted targeting by the Garda of a suspect.  There are instances where the Garda would like to have this power and it would be covered by the same rules and regulations we are setting out for surveillance devices.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I am inclined to support the amendment.  I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage on which we had a good deal of discussion.  I do not wish to rehash the points made, other than to say Deputy Ó Snodaigh makes a reasonable point, which was made in correspondence Members received from the Irish Human Rights Commission.  Notwithstanding what the Minister said in the earlier discussion of the matter, I do not see any harm in the amendment or how it would detract from the import of the legislation in any event.  It is important that the definition be extended, as outlined in the amendment.  Where is the harm in it or what is the downside of the amendment?  The Minister will say the amendment is either, at best, unnecessary, or, at worst, damaging.  I am inclined to support the amendment on the basis of the points made to us, with particular reference to clearing up any doubt as to what surveillance might mean.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The import of the legislation is not to interfere in the regular day-to-day surveillance that is the norm of policing.  The focus of the amendment is surveillance with the aid of electronic surveillance devices.  What the Deputies are proposing, in effect, is that the normal type of surveillance would also be included.  That would result in utter confusion from a Garda point of view as to whether the members of the force would have to get authorisation to have a normal type of investigation for the monitoring of known criminals.  That would leave the hands of the gardaí very much tied behind their backs in terms of normal, day-to-day policing.The amendments seek to allow for the targeting of persons by the Garda, including repeated photographing of persons.  What is "targeted surveillance"?  The Garda would have to make a determination as to what is "ordinary surveillance" and what is "targeted surveillance" and decide on the use of informants.  In effect, the aim of the three amendments is to expand the definition of surveillance.  The Bill is designed to regulate surveillance by electronic means, including tracking devices or other electronic devices.  Cameras are specifically excluded from the definition of surveillance devices.  I cannot accept the amendment.  The expansion of the definition as proposed by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, supported by Deputy Flanagan, would tend to include ordinary day-to-day surveillance by gardaí and would make the situation totally unworkable from their point of view.

I cannot ask the Minister to consider an alternative wording at this Stage.  The wording in the amendment is one we came up with in an effort to be helpful.  Surveillance, as defined in the Bill, covers a great deal of Garda activities.  Monitoring takes place on a regular basis, but it does not allow for photographing or video recording on an ongoing basis.  That is why we included the wording "ongoing and repeated photographing of persons for the purposes of monitoring and/or recording the movements" in the amendment.I will not press the amendment.  I have argued the case put forward by the Irish Human Rights Commission that the wording proposed in the amendment should come under the definition of surveillance and what surveillance devices are allowed to be used by the Garda Síochána.  It is a pity that due to the rushed nature of the debate we have not had a longer period to tease out whether this type of definition is covered in other jurisdictions.  I will leave it at that for the moment.  I urge the Minister to consider the matter as the Bill progresses to the Seanad.  He might have an opportunity to amend it there and we can return to the matter in the Dáil.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The Minister referred to "ordinary" surveillance and "targeted" surveillance.  We are dealing with a definition of surveillance.  Is the Minister telling the House that a targeted and repeated photographing of persons for the purposes of monitoring and recording their movements, activities and communications is not surveillance?  If that is not surveillance, then I do not know what is.  I am not sure whether we are in the business of talking about ordinary surveillance, targeted surveillance and special surveillance.  We are talking about surveillance.  I would have thought that in a definition of surveillance we would not leave a doubt as to what is surveillance for the purposes of legislation.  We are not talking about a tourist with a camera.  We are talking about activity that is targeted, repeated and ongoing for the purposes of monitoring and recording a person's movements and activities.  It seems to me that this is surveillance.I am not sure whether that will hinder the Garda in the course of its work.  That would not be anything like the object of the exercise.  What we are doing is ensuring that what is in the legislation allows the Garda to engage in the type of activity that will be legally recognised and accepted under law.  I would be disappointed if the Minister were to say that the amendment would hamper the Garda in the course of its duties.  I would not like to be associated with any section of an Act that might so do.  The activity is either surveillance or it is not.  To talk about ordinary surveillance, as opposed to some other type of surveillance, is to subject the Bill to a lot of argument.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	593	Amendment No. 3 refers to using officers to monitor the movements, activities and communications of a subject in a targeted, ongoing and repeated way.  If one were to allow that, in effect, one is extending the definition of surveillance and, therefore, extending the necessity for an authorisation to be gained from a judge in order to allow officers to monitor the movements, activities and communications of a subject in a targeted way.  The whole portent of the legislation was to allow the evidence garnered from electronic surveillance devices to be used in evidence.  Officers who monitor and survey on a normal policing basis are able to give the evidence in court themselves and be cross-examined.  That is the distinction and it is necessary in that the Bill deals with electronic devices and the admissibility of the evidence garnered by such devices as opposed to that garnered in normal day-to-day policing activity in respect of which the gardaí would be questioned in a subsequent trial.

I presume that gardaí, in their day-to-day activity, must have to sign off on the use of cameras and video cameras.  This may involve obtaining permission from a senior officer.  There is obviously a high threshold set for most of the surveillance devices in question.  Perhaps there is a flaw in my amendment in this regard.  The use of a camera or video camera, for a designated purpose, might have to be signed out with the permission of a superintendent, inspector or officer of another grade.  Doing so would attest to the fact that a device has not been interfered with and records the correct date.  We are not trying to prevent the operations of gardaí who, in the normal course of events, happen upon a robbery or encounter, by chance, a suspect they have been looking for and use their mobile telephone, for example, to capture information.  If the new TETRA system were running properly and radios had the facility to take photographs, as is the case with some police communications systems, the information gleaned could be used for the purpose to which I refer.My amendment was not intended to hamper the Garda in any way but to ensure that ongoing activity would be facilitated.  In this regard, consider the example of a stake-out where it is known that a criminal gang or individual is planning a crime in respect of which some type of recording device must be put in place — for example, to record movements to and from a specific location.  This is not covered.  Monitoring and observing require personal attestation whereas, with this Bill, we are trying to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights to ensure that ongoing surveillance will not breach the right to privacy while at the same time allowing the Garda to carry out its functions properly.  If this balance is struck, the Garda could use the information gleaned in a court case to ensure that the convictions desired by the public are made.I am concerned that the use of cameras and video cameras will not be admissible in court or that there might be a challenge if they are used on an ongoing basis on the grounds that they are not authorised surveillance devices covered by this legislation.  I might be wrong.  I was trying to be helpful by tabling my three related amendments in this regard.

In page 5, line 1, after "devices" to insert "including tracking devices".This amendment is similar to those we have just discussed.  It deals with tracking devices and is based on the report given to us by the Irish Human Rights Commission, which stated there should be an explanation offered as to why tracking devices are not included in the definition of "surveillance" and why the use of tracking devices will come under section 3 of the Bill.Mr. Justice Morris criticised the absence of any statutory or other guidelines governing the practice of surveillance.  My amendment focuses on this because surveillance by a tracking device is akin to the surveillance already mentioned, although in many ways it is rudimentary.  It raises some concerns in respect of the right to privacy, which is covered by the European Convention on Human Rights.  I propose to ensure that the use of surveillance devices by the Garda will not fall outside the law and that there will be a rationale behind their use that at least will have a basis in law.  If this is achieved, there will be safeguards similar to those applicable to other devices.  We are trying to ensure that the use of tracking devices is admissible in law and they can be used effectively to ensure that people are brought to justice.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	598	The Bill defines surveillance as monitoring, observing, listening to or making a recording of persons, places or things by or with the assistance of surveillance devices.  The reason "tracking device" is defined separately is because it involves a different type of surveillance.  A tracking device is used only for the purpose of providing information on the location of a person, vehicle or thing.  It is defined separately in order to distinguish it from other types of surveillance device because, by its nature, surveillance by a tracking device is less intrusive than that by other devices.  As such, the approval procedure, rather than a judicial authorisation, is used to allow the use of the tracking device.  The amendment proposed by the Deputy would lead to confusion and I cannot accept it.  A tracking device is different from the other surveillance devices, which are used in particular to monitor activities.  The latter could be used to listen to activities of individuals while the former is only used to show the location of a person.

A tracking device can now be quite sophisticated and can track more than an individual's general location.  It could track somebody going to the toilet, for example.  Therefore, a question arises over interference with the right to privacy.  All we are trying to do is ensure that the Bill does not fall foul of laws establishing the right to privacy and other laws.  I presume tracking devices that are also listening devices which can be switched on or off would be covered by the law as it stands.We need more time to consider this legislation.  The Bill could have been much more detailed and allow greater scope for the Garda Síochána.

In page 5, line 19, after "Síochána," to insert the following:"officers of an Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission,".These amendments try to ensure that the powers of surveillance that we are trying to grant to the Garda Síochána in this Bill are also available to the members of the Defence Forces and to another organisation set up to investigate crime especially in light of the Morris report and the danger that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission would be hampered if it did not have the power to properly investigate crimes that have been drawn to its attention.We had a good argument on this on Committee Stage.  Although I went away and thought about it I could not see the logic of the delay in giving this power to the commission given the scale of the abuse of power that the Morris tribunal investigated.  I hope that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission would never have to resort to the use of surveillance devices or ongoing surveillance and that the members of the Garda under investigation would co-operate and prove wrong the charges against them.To deny these powers to the commission would suggest that the new era that was promised for the Garda and the investigation of abuses of power has not reached its full conclusion and we have a long way to go.  It is not a power that any of the organisations that will be mentioned in the Act can use at will but it is important given that the commission often investigates serious injury, or a death in custody, or maybe a cover up.  In Donegal explosives were used, hoax bombs were prepared and officers colluded to cover up what was happening.  It is sometimes difficult in any organisation to get to the truth of a matter.  We should give whatever tools we can to an organisation tasked with investigating these complaints even in the case of a death.Most cases that come before the commission, like those that came before the Garda Síochána, have been ruled as frivolous but now and again serious charges are made.  We need to ensure that the commission has the tools to carry out a full investigation if that is ever required.  Hopefully it will not be.  There is a change in the culture of the Garda from the top down and I do not expect the power I am proposing to grant to the commission to be used at all.  That would be a good sign.The final amendment in the group tabled by me and Deputy Rabbitte seeks to delete section 17 which ensures that they are not excluded but the preceding amendments name the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission earlier in the Bill so that we do not grant it powers simply by not excluding it but do so specifically.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I broadly support Deputy Ó Snodaigh's points.  The powers that we are conferring here are being conferred not alone on the Garda Síochána but also on the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners.  It might at first glance appear questionable or odd that such powers are being conferred on the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners but on reflection and following the Committee Stage debate it makes perfect sense to extend these powers and the admissibility of the evidence so gathered to the Revenue Commissioners and to military intelligence and so on.I cannot see why the Minister is expressly excluding the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  He did not tell us a great deal, notwithstanding a lengthy debate on Committee Stage.  He said the ombudsman commission should learn to crawl before it walks, that it is a new institution, and let us test it and see how it performs when its mettle is tested against experience and it builds up its own jurisprudence, and so on.  That is not much of an argument.  It runs against the experience outside this jurisdiction.  This facility is extended to the ombudsman in Northern Ireland.Deputy Ó Snodaigh makes a fair point when he brings the Morris report into the debate.  We have an extraordinary capacity in this country to forget things when it suits us and to consign to oblivion something like the Morris tribunal on which we spent a great deal of taxpayers' money, and time.  The Morris tribunal report makes several recommendations and we nod in their direction then put them on a shelf somewhere where they are forgotten.  It is nowhere similar in any way to criticising the Garda Síochána generally to say that what was revealed in the Morris report was appalling beyond belief and some of what was done defied belief.Some of my colleagues will never forgive the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for his reaction to that report when he came in here and created a diversion by selecting two colleagues in the House for criticism.  If Deputy Stagg and I were put in possession of disturbing information of an allegedly criminal nature what could be more responsible other than going to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and telling him or her the information we were given and that we do not know whether there is anything in it and asking that it be checked out because it is of great concern?  This is what my colleagues in the House did at the time but the Minister created a sideshow here and blew up a sandstorm and avoided the issues that Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised today about the Morris report.The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission has the remit to inquire into alleged serious offences that, as has been stated, might well involve the death of a person or serious injury and in any event, the investigation of arrestable offences.  If there were allegations of that gravity and the commission felt obliged prima facie to have them investigated then it ought to have available to it the same tools to do the job as the Garda Síochána has in terms of arrestable offences in the jurisdiction generally.I cannot see any plausible reason for putting the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission at a disadvantage because if it was investigating complaints along the lines that might be referred to it, which would involve allegations of corruption in the Garda Síochána, it would manifestly be a more serious case than if those allegations were affecting an ordinary citizen.  I do not think it is any secret that Ombudsman offices in the neighbouring countries which I mentioned believe that they ought to have available to them the capacity through surveillance to assemble evidence that might be admissible in court subsequently.For the Minister to state that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is a new institution and is not yet experienced is not very convincing.  There may well be a meeting of minds between the Minister and his officials in this regard but I do not know why.  We are scarcely talking about bugging the Garda stations of the country.  If malfeasance was suspected or under way it is a bit improbable that it will be conducted from the Garda station in any event.  Whether it is or is not, the argument for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission being treated the same as the Garda Síochána seems to be compelling in terms of the instruments at its disposal to fight crime wherever that crime is it, yet the Minister has not replied addressed this.The Minister can do it whichever way he wishes.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh has advanced a couple of alternative amendments and I advanced the excision of the relevant subsection.  Whether or which, the Minister should not permit this Bill to be passed while putting the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission at a disadvantage.  It is very important to this House and those who established the commission with such expectation and confidence that what happened can never happen again and that people can have confidence when complaints are made that they are fairly, thoroughly, rigorously and properly investigated and that the commission is shown to be a success.  We and the taxpayers have a vested interest in that and I do not think the taxpayers would appreciate the Minister putting the commission at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the powers we are now conferring on the Garda Síochána.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I am inclined to agree with the amendments.  We had this debate on Committee Stage.  I recollect that the Minister did not have a huge problem with the principle of what is contained in the amendment.  His objection was more from a time point of view, that the Garda Ombudsman Commission is not sufficiently experienced or has not had sufficient time to experience a review or extension of its powers.  I would like to hear more of a principled argument rather than an argument on the matter of time.If we were dealing with the matter of time then the inclusion of a review mechanism in the legislation that would allow for us in the House to revisit the legislation at some early date might make the Minister's argument more compelling.  However, the only reference to a review of the operation of the legislation is by consultation between the President of the High Court and the Minister under section 12, which presumably would be in private and would not have any bearing on any activities that might take place in the House other than by motion on the part of the Minister.  It seems the Minister has reserved unto himself any powers of review and perhaps this makes the extension at this stage of powers under the legislation to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission all the more important.On Committee Stage I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that the adjoining jurisdiction of Northern Ireland had such powers vested in its ombudsman.  Perhaps in retrospect I did not pick the best example because the Minister stated — I accept what he said — that the policing situation is such in Northern Ireland that it is somewhat different to here and has been for reasons on which there is no need for us to dwell for any extended period of time.Best practice in England and Wales could be considered on this side of the water in a way that perhaps the situation in Northern Ireland might not.  Under section 4(1) of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (Investigatory Powers) Order 2004, officers of the Independent Police Complaints Commission are prescribed as being capable of authorising surveillance for the purposes of the legislation.  We can draw upon best international practice.  It is important to note that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is already engaged in some respect in this proposed legislation given the complaints procedure and the role that we are vesting in the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission under section 11.  It will, therefore, be involved in some respects as a receiving party for a complaint.However, while it may be that the commission has an involvement, when it wishes to engage in the surveillance that may be necessary having regard to the fact it is charged with the responsibility of dealing with serious matters involving the death and serious injury of citizens and the embarking by it of an appropriate investigation into these matters, it could well be that we will hamper the commission's work by not according appropriate power to it as we are according not only to the Garda but to members of the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners.  Greater power is being given to the Revenue Commissioners than to a body designated as a complaints office under the legislation.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	605	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Government imposed cutbacks to services for sick children in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  Recently the House debated the horrific abuse of children at the hands of the religious and the State.  It was resolved on all sides of the House that no such thing would ever be allowed to happen again.  While that debate was taking place, the Minister for Health and Children was withdrawing money from the children's hospital, which had the effect of forcing the administrators to close wards and a life saving operating theatre.  If this action is not reversed, it will cause severe suffering, prolonged pain and misery to innocent, sick children.The closure of a life saving operating theatre is most likely to be the cause of children dying unnecessarily.  The mothers of these children will never forgive the Minister for the actions she took that led to this sorry pass.  She put a system in place that empowers an unaccountable quango to use taxpayers' money as its sees fit.  It is not only a shame or a disgrace, it is a crime to allow little children to suffer unnecessary pain and misery and even avoidable death.  The Minister and her Fianna Fáil backers who keep her in office are responsible and I would not like to have the consequences of her actions on my conscience.I refer to two children in my own constituency, who are typical of those needing services at in Our Lady's children's hospital.  The first is little Jack McNiffe who has spent most of his four years in the hospital.  He has been wonderfully cared for and he has had a number of procedures successfully carried out there and in Great Ormond Street hospital.  His mother, Aisling, is stressed and worried that the cutbacks in resources at Crumlin hospital will mean vital procedures being dangerously delayed.  This boy and his mother have suffered enough without this added unnecessary hassle.The second child is Devinn Behan.  I welcome him and his parents to the Visitors Gallery.  Devinn is a bright 12-year old boy who has a condition which has led the twisting of his spine, which, in turn, is damaging his hearts and lungs.  He urgently needs an operation to correct this condition.  On 26 May, the Irish Independent reported on his case and spoke to his mother, Veronica:"His mother Veronica spoke last night of her fears for his health. Desperate efforts to have the surgery to treat his neurofibromatosis — an aggressive spinal deformity — have so far failed, as the condition worsens."We have been told it is a life-threatening condition, with major impacts on his quality of life and life expectancy," she added.A fifth-class pupil at Scoil Bride in Naas, Devinn requires complex surgery which will involve two operations — leaving him in theatre for two 12-hour sessions."Last year, we were informed by the medical team in Crumlin that Devinn's case was a priority but unfortunately there was no space available in the theatre," his mother said."That was still the case when we went back in May. I contacted the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to find out if it could be done privately but was told it was too expensive and too complex."I was then directed to the national hospitals' office in the Health Service Executive and was told it would take place in September."But there was no confirmation from the medical team in Crumlin and the hospitals' office has now told us there is no date for the operation. Our only hope is to apply for inclusion in the treatment abroad scheme but if this is granted it will mean we will have to travel abroad with the cost up to 40pc higher than if the operation was carried out in Crumlin."Devinn's condition is continuing to deteriorate. By the time he is operated on, he will require several surgeries."Metal rods were fitted to part of Devinn's spine when he was six but these have become detached, causing him to bend forward and leaving him with growth problems, with stress on his heart and lungs. . ."The next surgery will involve detaching the rods and placing him in spinal traction."Then he will undergo instrumental correction of the spine and be fitted with new metal rods . . ."Devinn's plight emerged as Crumlin has imposed ward and theatre cuts because of a €9m shortfall in funding this year.Both families have the fullest praise for the nurses and staff in Crumlin hospital and they are fearful that the Minister's resources limitation will cause even more suffering for their special children.  These children and others have suffered enough and, on their behalf, I plead with her to find the money for the banks and builders somewhere other than in the budget for Our Lady's hospital.  If she has an ounce of human kindness, she will surely do so.  If she is not mindful to heed my plea, perhaps she will heed the pleas of the mothers of the children.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	606	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.It seems clear that the real agenda behind the closing of wards in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin is ideological and it is not only monetary.  It is skewed logic to believe that the case for the centralisation of paediatric care in Dublin will be strengthened by running down the quality of service offered in Crumlin hospital.  If money alone is the issue, there are plenty of ways the Government and the HSE could make up the €9.1 million shortfall.  The HSE spent €17 million on spin doctors and management consultants in 2008.  This money could pay for the reopening of the wards in Crumlin hospital and the cervical cancer vaccine for 12-year old girls.  A 17% reduction in the HSE's €60 million taxi spend would meet the budgetary shortfall of the hospital for 2009 while a 20% reduction in the €50 million spent on renting prefabs for schools would ensure children could access a full suite of services in Our Lady's hospital.However, this is not only about money.  The HSE and Government remain hell-bent on following the plans of a Minister whose own party and its ideology regarding health care is defunct.  Across the world the health strategies espoused by the Progressive Democrats, which are closer to Boston than Berlin, are being rejected even in the bastion of capitalism, the United States.  This ideology extends from co-location of private hospitals on public lands to running down paediatric hospitals to promote the case for the centralisation of services on a patently unsuitable site.  I have no quarrel with the concept of centralisation of medical services if the decision is based on sound medical care and services but I have an issue when it is railroaded through at the cost of a vital service to certain sectors of the community for reasons that have little to do with the provision of good health services.I refer to the issue of fund-raising and the burden placed on families and friends to raise money for basic health care services for children.  Even in good times we faced a scenario whereby the children's hospital had to spend valuable time and resources on fund-raising and to depend on the goodwill of many generous people.  The need to make funds available is more acute than ever but it is also more difficult than ever to raise funds from people who are penalised through heavy taxation measures and who are also fund-raising for their local school playground, sports club and every other facility that should be provided by the State.Without these very generous donors, our public health service for the children who attend Our Lady's Hospital would be in much worse condition.  Even with the about-turn by the HSE yesterday, one ward will still remain closed.  Aside from that, it is a disgrace that public and political pressure forces the Government and the HSE to capitulate, not the fact that children's health will be significantly affected.The Government constantly accuses the Opposition of histrionics whenever we highlight the scale of indebtedness it plans to lump upon taxpayers, such as with the blanket bank guarantee and now with NAMA.  These decisions are saddling every household in the State with enormous debts, while those who ran up those debts in banks and development companies remain in situ.  If we think it appropriate to saddle the next generations with the debts of a greedy and favoured few, then we can afford at least to give people proper health services.  While the favoured few are being bailed out, operations are cancelled or postponed, children are added to waiting lists and stressed-out parents are left to worry about their sick children.I have no doubt but that the staff of Our Lady's Hospital will do what they have always done, namely, go that extra mile for the children in their care.  However, there is only so much anybody can do without resources and funding.  Our Lady's Hospital is located in my constituency and I am acutely aware of the service it provides for children throughout the country and, more specifically, the medical care it provides for many local people who have brought their children there in emergencies.  I am one of those people who has personal knowledge of the exceptional medical care offered by Our Lady's, having once over-nighted there with a favourite nephew.In the last analysis, it is down to the Minister to decide how the resources are to be allocated.  Our Lady's Hospital and the children in its care should not be the fall guys for the mismanagement of the finances of this country.

We may and will disagree about matters, but there is no greater priority for the Government than to protect and provide for our children.  Our children are our flesh and blood.  They are our future.  When a child is ill, this is devastating and affects family and friends.  For those of us elected to represent thousands of families, we have a duty to highlight concerns such as health provision and care.I have spent the past two weeks highlighting the issue of scoliosis patients, in particular the plight of Jamie Murphy from Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny.  I am delighted that a private benefactor has come forward to speed up Jamie's operation, what I want to see is certainty that no child will suffer a delay in treatment for scoliosis or any other ailment because of restraints in the system.  I do not like the word "restraints".  Let us call a spade a spade; we are talking about cutbacks. Over the past two weeks I have learnt a lot about scoliosis and how it affects growing children and how important it is to obtain surgery before curvature of the spine causes intense pain, harm to vital organs and terrible disfigurement.I could not stand over delays in treatment because of closures, delays in life enhancing surgery or more cutbacks that would extend the waiting time for scoliosis patients to be seen.  Some very good things have happened recently.  The planned closure of a ward and theatre mentioned in the motion moved by the Opposition will not now happen.  The postponement of outpatient appointments by 15%, which would have affected approximately 8,843 patients, will not happen and neither will there be 1,100 fewer admissions.  As of yesterday, in discussions between the HSE and the three Dublin paediatric hospitals, it was agreed that Crumlin Children's hospital would revert, as a matter of urgency, to the HSE with its proposals to address the needs of scoliosis patients between now and the end of the year.  It is my understanding that the HSE will get active on these proposals within days.  The waiting list for scoliosis treatment has fallen and will fall further and there are now dedicated theatre sessions put in place for the paediatric consultant performing this surgery in Crumlin.  I welcome that.I want to ensure that not only those on emergency lists, but those awaiting life-saving surgery will be treated speedily in Crumlin hospital.  I want to ensure that we work to reverse the closure of the 25-bed ward and a hospital theatre.  I believe that will be done.  I personally want to thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Mary Harney, for her work on this issue in recent days.  The provision of quality services and non-emergency services is an issue in which I have a deep interest, as has the Green Party.  Recession or no recession, cutbacks cannot be allowed to cause pain for children.  That is a given.  As the Minister said last night, "No child should ever be in pain as they await necessary treatment".I would also like to know what the €30 million in fundraising is doing sitting on deposit on behalf of a hospital foundation.  If money is being spent on improvements to the hospitals emergency department, why can it not be spent on other essential items?  I know hundreds of people who have fund-raised, run marathons, mini marathons or shaken buckets all over the country to help the hospital.  Why is that money not being spent?On the question of budgets, it should be noted that the Fine Gael Party's budget proposals for 2009 included a cut in all current budgets of 3%, from the 2008 level.  Fine Gael cut the funding of the Green Party last night by refusing to give us a pair so that we could take part in a fund raiser to raise funds for Crumlin Children's Hospital.  That was an own goal.We are all aware of the challenges facing our health system as budgets get tighter.  More demands are placed on the system due to increased population.  Hospitals will have to work hard to find savings, be resourceful with their facilities and do all they can to centralise services such as the measures outlined in last night's debate.  Despite the budgetary pressures facing all concerned and the work within the service to increase efficiency and resourcefulness, our children must not be caught in the middle waiting for care or surgery.On the question of savings, nothing must be spared in protecting front line services.  Care for our children is a sine qua non.  We will do whatever it takes ensure the best hospital care for them.  That is the hallmark of a civilised society and that is what I am working for.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I welcome the opportunity to address this motion.  While the specifics of the motion are particular to a section within the health service, the sentiment behind it and the approach taken in the House by the Opposition follow what has come to be a common pattern in recent weeks and months.  The Opposition identifies a service facing budgetary pressure — what public delivered service funded by the State does not face such pressure? — succeeds in whipping up a frenzy, selects a number of individual cases and seeks to evoke a sense of shock and awe at these and then proceeds as if these are the fault of the Government.The Opposition fails to identify the exceptional work done on behalf of so many patients on a daily basis.  By isolating a small number of cases in individual and particular circumstances, the Opposition seeks to portray these as the way in which the health service is delivered.  This does a disservice to the phenomenal work done by the health service and the people who work on the front line.  It is wrong to present these cases as the norm.  The Opposition offers its solution, but its solution, which it comes up with on a weekly basis for all these areas it identifies, is not to tax but to spend more money to resolve the problem.  It ignores its own so-called budgetary strategy, that great alternative strategy it is prepared to put forward.Whatever the issue is — tonight it is Crumlin hospital but it will be something else next week — the same solution emerges, put up and spend more money.  The Opposition will not agree with any of the taxation measures the Government has brought forward nor with any of the methods of raising funds to take account of the losses in Revenue.  The Minister has made the situation clear and we are all well aware of the cost of the provision of the health service, over €15 billion a year.  We are raising taxes this year of between €33 billion and €34 billion and will borrow €20 billion.  We cannot ignore that.Budgetary strategy talks about cost containment and reducing costs through efficiency.  The solution to the problem in Crumlin hospital is to find efficiencies through closer co-operation between the three hospitals in the network, Tallaght, Temple Street and Crumlin.  The front-line staff in these hospitals work extremely hard. I believe there is a management issue.  Everyone talks about plugging the black hole within the health budget.  That means change and closer co-operation.  It means smarter and more efficient ways of working to deliver that service.Phenomenal advances have taken place in medical technology and in the way in which doctors go about their business during operations.  Patients spend much less time in hospitals.  Notwithstanding that, the cost of delivering this level of service has increased considerably, but there are much better outcomes.We have to look at ways to manage delivery more efficiently, through closer co-operation of services and bringing them under one umbrella.  In resolving a problem like this it is not unusual that one would find some resistance to change.  The technology, medical practice and better outcomes are available and now the service delivery component has to change to ensure the most efficient use can be achieved from the money that is available.I am somewhat taken aback by Deputy Stagg's statement tonight, when he referred to the Government bailing out the banks and the builders, and that the money involved in that could be better used to resolve the problems in Crumlin Hospital.  It is an outrageous concept to put forward.  It shows no regard for the basic understanding of how this has come about.The boom years were created, perhaps wrongly, by the builders and bankers, but by creating the boom, which generated more wealth for the economy and increased the amount of money that came into the coffers of the State——

The funding coming into the State allowed the Government to increase spending in Crumlin by 39% in 2004.  The Deputy should work through that logic.  Deputy Stagg is blaming the builders, the bankers and the boom.  The reality is that as a result of the boom spending has increased in the period 2004 to date by 39%.  We are discussing here a reduction of 3%.  We need to have some perspective on this.First and foremost, we have to get away from the notion that it is somebody else's fault and that the financial difficulties we face are somebody else's fault and that the service delivery is being affected by it.

I acknowledge the very fine work that takes place, the level of patient care and the application of medicine in Crumlin hospital.  All Deputies know of people who have experienced the hospital and the benefits that have arisen from it.  I welcome the decision announced yesterday not to proceed with the closures during the summer months.Crumlin hospital or the wider HSE should not be dragged into disrepute.  The comparisons that are being made between running the HSE and bailing out bakers and builders is idiotic.  We have to start getting real about the banking scenario and the running of the HSE and stop mixing apples and oranges.  The bank guarantee scheme and the capitalisation of the banks are necessary for reasons which are well documented in this House.  If we had a scenario where people went to their bank and found their deposits were not there, we would have a completely different scenario on our hands.  Comparing that, and the effort going into the running of Crumlin hospital and the wider hospital service, is not on.

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	622	It brings the whole debate into disrepute.  That is my opinion on it and I am entitled to it.Regarding Ireland and the three children's hospital locations, we have a population of 4 million people and the three hospitals have a combined budget of some €250 million.  To bring them into one location will bring efficiencies and economies of scale.  It is correct to compare Birmingham Hospital to Crumlin.  Birmingham has a budget of some €212 million in comparison to Crumlin's budget of €144 million, a difference of 45%.  Birmingham provided 32,000 inpatient treatments in 2008 and Crumlin provided approximately 10,000.  Birmingham can provide about three times the number of inpatient cases because it operates in one location with a budget that is 40% higher than that of Crumlin.  It is a comparable situation and we have to compare like with like.Regarding health services in general, I have noticed a trend in all the debates here.  There is never an acknowledgement given that during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s all political parties in the House contributed to the demise and deficit of capital and human resources in the health service, and that a catch-up had to happen over the last number of years and must also take place into the future.  Every political party in the Chamber is responsible for that and that is the process in which we are now involved.Having an agency like the HSE, which is detached from direct interference and input and from people in the Executive and in this House is the correct way to proceed.  We have Members in the House who have a medical background and can contribute to the formulation of policy, and this is advantageous.  Nobody in this House should have direct input or interference into the running of hospitals.  We have people who are paid——
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The Deputy should say that to the board.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I am giving my opinion.  People are paid to do a job and are given a budget to do it.  We cannot have a midsummer rush every year, particularly with the economic crisis in which we find ourselves.  We cannot have a midsummer hiatus every year, where hospitals state they are running short.  All organisations, whether hospitals or whatever, have to operate within budgets.  That is the situation in which we find ourselves.We had a debate in the House recently on the reconfiguration of health services in the mid-west region in which we all took part.  Not one person has contacted me since the reconfiguration was announced to make a complaint or to say the level of care they received was diminished in any way.  That is significant.  Perhaps other people have other stories to tell, but I am giving my experience and I am just one person.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.  I thank the board of Crumlin Hospital, particularly the deputy chair and all those who attended for the presentation and tour of the hospital they gave to members of the Oireachtas health committee.  As someone who has availed of the services of Crumlin Hospital for my daughter — many of my constituents have also availed of them — I am very conscious of the excellent work carried out there and I complement it on being a wonderful centre of excellence for paediatric care.The concerns of the health committee, and my own concerns, and the reasons we were motivated to visit the hospital are that front line service for children be maintained, and all sides of the House agree with this.  I recognise that because Crumlin is a national hospital providing many services exclusive to it, unlike an adult who may need a particular treatment or procedure and can avail of it in another hospital, often the only option for a child is Crumlin Hospital.We recognise that the current economic climate is very difficult, and this has also been acknowledged by all sides in this House.  In the past, when money was more plentiful, it was argued that value for money across all sectors in society was not achieved, and the medical sector is no exception to this.I have examined the budget for Crumlin Hospital over the past five years and significant increases were provided.  There has been a 38% increase in funding and the budget for this year stands at €139.6 million.  It represents a 3% reduction on the money that was available in 2008, which was €143.63 million.  I come from a town with a hospital and recognise that it is always very difficult for any hospital to operate within its budget, but it is also important that savings are made and greater efficiencies are achieved, where possible.I was very impressed with the board of Crumlin when we met it yesterday with how it achieved efficiency between 2007 and 2008.  They pointed out to us at the meeting yesterday that in 2007 the hospital had a budget deficit at the end of the year.  Going into 2008, it requested an increase of €14 million from the HSE but was denied this and was given €7 million.  In 2008, it still managed to break even without any reduction in service, ward closures or theatre closures.  I am simply making the point that very successfully, through its own management efficiency, it managed to achieve excellent results and greater efficiencies in 2008, which is a credit to it.The cost measure that causes me particular concern is the closure of St. Joseph's ward with 25 beds.  This ward deals with orthopaedic and neurology patients, but the board pointed out yesterday that these patients are now being accommodated in other wards in the hospital.  All of this information and the figures have been presented by the board and I am not dealing with any other information.  My colleague mentioned Birmingham hospital and I point out that the board would disagree with some of the figures and the comparisons between those two hospitals.  I acknowledge this and it is an issue we will have to take up with Professor Brendan Drumm when he comes before the committee next week.I point out that there are 248 beds in Crumlin, 223 of which are open, which is 81,395 bed nights in a given year.  In 2008, with all wards open in the hospital, 72,280 bed nights were used.  The major growth in activity for Crumlin Hospital, again pointed out by the board, is in day cases involving those who do not stay overnight in hospital, in which there has been a significant increase of 30% in the past four years.Another area of major concern for me is the closure of the theatre because theatre procedures increased by 34% in that four-year period, and I addressed that specific question to the board when I was at the hospital yesterday.  However, I am heartened by the fact the hospital has clearly stated that no child has been denied access to emergency life-saving surgery due to the hospital's financial break-even programme for 2009 — it is important to recognise this point.  I asked the board why it was necessary to close the ward and the theatre and they informed me that between 2008 and 2009 there were 25 fewer nurses in the hospital, which was necessitated by a €600,000 reduction in the amount spent on agency staff.  Again, it is an issue I will take up with Professor Drumm next week.On the positive side for the hospital, its management and administration is very competitive at 13.6% of staff, which compares very favourably with many other hospitals that have 16% to 20% of the staff taken up in this area.  I would ask the Minister to address the issue which was brought forward, namely, that the staff complement at the hospital and the budget for the hospital has not been scientifically arrived at but has been inherited from the old health board days.  I welcome the fact there will be a new national children's hospital.  I believe this will be to everyone's benefit and we must ensure it is completed by 2014.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate and I compliment our colleague, Deputy James Reilly, on giving us that opportunity.  One would need to have a heart of stone when one sees children needing urgent hospital treatment.  Those of us who are parents or, as in my case, a grandparent, can empathise with the parents of those children.  One could not but be concerned and upset about the current situation.  Deputy Mary White made reference to the case of the Kilkenny girl, Jamie Murphy, and I know much credit is due to the benefactor who helped in that regard.I received calls on that subject this morning following the publication of The Irish Times pointing out that a foundation which raises funds for the Crumlin children’s hospital had almost €30 million available to it at the end of 2007, to which reference was made in the Dáil this morning.  The report states, “...the Children’s Medical and Research Foundation insisted yesterday that its resources could not be used for the purpose of plugging the gap left by shortfalls”.  Other colleagues receiving calls might also wonder about this matter, which is an item for debate.  The report states that funds are being used for children’s parties, refurbishments and to upgrade equipment.  While I bow to no one in my admiration for the Crumlin hospital and the marvellous work it does, it is a fair point to make and there is a question to be asked.Like other colleagues, I visited the Crumlin hospital yesterday.  It is not the first time I have been there.  I am a child of Crumlin and I remember the hospital being opened in 1956.  I wonder how many of my colleagues can claim, as I can, that they were treated in that hospital and, although it was a long time ago, I remember it well.  All three of my children were patients there, as was my little granddaughter.  I have huge admiration for what happens at the hospital.  While it is not in my constituency, many people from Tallaght and Dublin South-West, like those from other parts of the country, go there.Yesterday's visit was very important.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children, under the chairmanship of Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl, was very clear as to why members wanted to visit the hospital.  I know journalists have questioned our motives but it was part of a process.  Deputy Reilly made the point that it was important that we went and saw the situation for ourselves, met the management team and the board, and had the opportunity to visit the facilities, including the operating theatres, and meet patients and their parents.  Tomorrow, we will take that information into the committee room — I know the committee Vice Chairman will also be present — and talk to senior officials of the HSE in regard to this issue.  The process will then be completed on 7 July, when the joint committee meets Professor Drumm.  A clear message we will give to the officials and Professor Drumm, bearing in mind the way all of us feel about the services, is that frontline services must be preserved.  There is all-party agreement and a determination by the committee to achieve this, and it is important we would try to get this message across to Professor Drumm and his officials.During this debate, there has been much reference to the future development of children's services in the country, particularly in the Dublin region.  I am a Dublin-born and based Deputy and I feel strongly about the fact we need what was described as a super-hospital.  Without playing politics, I have always made the point that the Mater hospital site was a mistake.  This is not just to make a case for Tallaght and many of us would agree——

There are issues regarding the Mater site, which it is important we understand, but we must also understand the need for a proper children's hospital.In that context, I wonder should the example of cancer services be adopted, given that the model of Professor Tom Keane has clearly driven forward those services and made a difference.  Is it time the Government and the Minister, in particular, would consider the need to provide for a children's hospital czar, such as Professor Keane, to drive forward this project and ensure children's services are provided in a proper way?
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Fine Gael motion.  Along with my colleagues, I would like to categorically refute the allegation that critically ill children have had essential treatment withdrawn.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital is recognised internationally as a centre of excellence in paediatric care.  Crumlin always has been, and continues to be, totally committed to the ongoing care of all children.I also welcome the announcement by the hospital that further ward and theatre closures, which had been proposed for July and August, will no longer be necessary.  I understand from the HSE that this decision was based on the financial performance for the first five months of 2009, which has strongly indicated that the hospital should achieve a break-even position at year end.Deputy Reilly raised a specific issue in last night's debate regarding surgery of children with scoliosis.  I would like to respond to this matter.  The debate about current services for children with scoliosis must not be reduced to over-simplified discussions about angles of spinal curvature.  As the health spokespeople know, the decision on whether to operate on a child must take into account many factors and is a complex weighing up of the benefit of the treatment against the risks inherent in surgery of this kind.  The decision to operate on a child will depend on many other factors, such as whether the family and surgeon wish to wait until the growth phase has ended to assess severity at that stage.  It will also be influenced by the possibility that anaesthetic risk may increase with age, such as with muscular dystrophy, and this will lead to much earlier intervention with curvature of possibly only 20%.I understand the HSE met yesterday with the three paediatric hospitals, including Temple Street, which also has extensive experience in this area, with a view to making inroads into the waiting times for scoliosis patients.  Crumlin has been asked to revert as a matter of urgency to the HSE with proposals to address the needs of scoliosis patients between now and year end.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, will consider these proposals as soon as they are finalised.The real challenge in paediatrics is to maximise the efficient use of all health care capacity in Dublin and throughout the country.  Paediatric services in Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals must increasingly work in a co-ordinated, shared and efficient fashion to prepare for the eventual coming together of the three institutions into one national paediatric hospital.  With this in mind, the HSE is actively pursuing ways in which services in the three hospitals can be best co-ordinated, to avoid unnecessary duplication and to achieve savings that can be put back into patient care.  For example, the three children's hospitals in Dublin have agreed and developed a model for the development of a joint department of paediatric surgery.  The clinical network in the three hospitals will make the best use of the resources available and will ensure a single system of care.  A recruitment process is underway to recruit three replacement surgeons that will then give the joint department a complement of seven surgeons.  Currently five are in place with another is due to retire shortly.

The HSE commissioned a review in 2008 of paediatric critical care facilities and services with a view to addressing any identified deficits in advance of the opening of the new national paediatric hospital.  The resulting report recommended that paediatric critical care services should operate as a single, joint clinical department for the Temple Street and Crumlin sites with a lead clinician, initially as part of a combined department of anaesthesia and critical care.  The hospital in Tallaght does not have an ICU, intensive care unit.  An Irish paediatric critical care network has been established as the advisory body to lead the development of a co-ordinated system for the delivery of paediatric critical care services and to develop advice, standards and recommendations regarding the optimum delivery of paediatric critical care services in the country.

It has raised the profile of this very serious issue.  I was with the delegation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children which visited the Crumlin hospital yesterday.  I compliment the board and management on the time they spent with us, the openness of the information provided and on their deep concern for the hospital and its patients.  I found the approach of those I met very humane and they expressed a great concern that the service they provide will be affected by the proposed changes.A Government Deputy welcomed the fact that the planned closure did not take place.  However, the reason it did not take place was the HSE approach, that is, to seek volunteers to absent themselves.  It sought people to leave voluntarily but could not achieve the appropriate mix.  In other words, the response was either all from nurses with no doctors or vice versa.  The resulting mix was not right and it was not feasible to implement the planned closure.  Those I met made this point very clearly.  The intended cutbacks must now take place elsewhere, which, they have indicated, will affect patient services and the treatment of patients.The hospital management made the point that the hospital, built in 1956, is a voluntary hospital and its operation and that of all voluntary hospitals is derived from public funding.  It goes against the whole approach to suggest private funding should be involved.  Any voluntary funding is used for research and capital development.  These are the reasons such money is collected and why the organisations carry out such fund-raising.  To switch such funding for use in the day-to-day running of the hospital is wrong and deceitful.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	639	That is not the reason the money was collected nor is it the intention of the board of management that the money should be spent in that way.  It is the duty of the Government to fund voluntary hospitals and to fund Crumlin hospital.Crumlin serviced 135,000 patients last year, including 80,000 outpatients, 30,000 emergencies and 24,500 in-patients, rather than the figure of 10,000 suggested by the Government side.  The issue of Birmingham hospital was raised.  It was suggested we were not comparing like with like.  However, the figures for Birmingham are based on inpatients and outpatients and the calculation for Crumlin hospital is for inpatients only.  When one compares the same figures for both hospitals, the result is the same.  The inefficiency suggested by some people in respect of Crumlin hospital is false.  It has seven theatres, six of which are open, as previously mentioned.  One theatre and some 25 beds have been closed because of the lack of finance.It was made clear to the visiting delegation that Crumlin hospital provides a national service of interventions, some of which are exclusive to it such as oncology, haematology, cardiac, thoracic surgery, burns and medical genetics.  It is also the national centre for cystic fibrosis.  It is a key hospital in ensuring these services are provided.It was pointed out to us on the wards that in any given ward there are people from all parts of Ireland, including the west, the south and the north.  The hospital provides a service to the nation.  It was also pointed out to us that at 13.6% of the total spend, management and administration costs are the lowest of any hospital in Ireland.  Efficiencies exist in the management and administration of the hospital, an area often finger-pointed by people as inefficient.  However this is not the case with Crumlin hospital.I refer to the proposed cuts.  The approach of the Government is crude and determined on an historical basis.  Much has changed in Crumlin hospital since the ballpark figures suggested by the Government.  The board of management of Crumlin hospital seeks a complete analysis of what is required given the changed circumstances.  It has no hesitation in welcoming an evaluation of its performance in the delivery of services.  Any such evaluation would find areas are under-resourced rather than otherwise.  Recent studies show an under-resourcing in intensive care.  The Minister of State has made comparisons with 2004 but I remind her that the number of outpatients has increased by 23% since then, the number of theatre procedures has increased by 34% and the number of ICU beds has increased by 21%.  The whole areas of service delivery has improved in numbers and because of improved medical developments.Some 25% of the increase that has occurred in costs is a result of payments to staff on the basis of agreements.  Therefore, there is no return for 25% of any increase and it must be paid in any event.  The non-pay element is only 3% and the balance of 13% is related to increases in volume and complexity of interventions to save the lives of children, as already outlined.  Prior to the time for which the Minister of State has made comparisons, cases of cardiac surgery were sent abroad at a substantial cost.  Now, no cases of cardiac surgery are sent abroad and all such procedures are completed in Crumlin.  They wish to develop other innovations such as national share-care programmes to keep more children at home.  It was explained to us that when children are discharged programmes or personnel such as dietitians are not available to ensure those children have a healthy diet and that it complements the surgical intervention or treatment in Crumlin hospital.  This service is not available on a nationwide basis.  There are no nurses or nutritionists.The social consequences are worse for children than for adults because if the surgery is not carried out, children grow with the problem which then causes difficulties.  They cannot give an assurance that no emergency case will not be dealt with.  They said that emergency cases may not be dealt with, that if the cuts continue we are going to fall further behind international norms for proper of children.  They are regarded as some of the leaders in Europe.  Much concern was expressed that the international norm of proper treatment for children would be dropped in Crumlin.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I thank Deputy Reilly for bringing forward this Private Members' motion on this critical subject, the cutbacks at Our Lady's children's hospital, Crumlin.  Last month, a 25-bed ward was closed at Our Lady's children's hospital which has led to much-needed procedures being cut.  There will also be reductions in outpatient clinics in August and in future months, which will cause severe disruption to services.  This will naturally lead to longer waiting times for children who need urgent surgery.  These cutbacks have resulted in the withdrawal of essential treatment for critically ill children and there has been an unacceptable increase in cancelled operations.  The hospital is likely to see further ward and theatre closures which will see a reduction of outpatient appointments by 15% or 8,483 attendances and 1,100 admissions in 2009.  In addition, the National Treatment Purchase Fund is not funding urgent cases and surgery for children experiencing acute pain and suffering, in spite of assurances given by the Minister for Health and Children on 21 May 2009.The 3% cutback across the board by the HSE is causing great misery to the various children and families affected and takes no account of the fact of the increased costs to the hospital of new technologies, the transfer of orthopaedic services from Cork to Crumlin, the increase in the birth rate over the past number of years and the fact that savings can be made elsewhere in the HSE budget.Our Lady's hospital, Crumlin is operating on a funding shortfall of €9 million.  As a result of this shortfall, 25 beds and a theatre were closed last month and this has caused pain and suffering for children.  This amount of money is small change in a total health budget of €15 billion.Fine Gael calls on the Government to put children first and immediately reverse this thoughtless decision of reducing the hospital's budget by €9.1 million and so alleviate the needless pain and suffering of hundreds of children.  I ask all Deputies in the House to support this very reasonable motion from Deputy Reilly.  There is no reason the Minister could not issue a directive to that hospital and other hospitals to ensure that the cutbacks do not take place on the frontline but rather in the back office.  It is frightening to read that the management of Our Lady's hospital in Crumlin will be unable to guarantee that urgent surgery and procedures will be treated.  This realises the worst fears of parents and children.I refer to the amount of wastage in the health service including the money wasted on public relations.  Professor Brendan Drumm receives a salary of more than €500,000 which is huge money.  There must be savings in salaries paid to the top people who are creaming the system.  Funding must be directed towards children.Jamie Murphy is a child who was forced to travel to London for immediate surgery because she could not receive it at Crumlin.  She is just one of many children who continue to wait on waiting lists.  This is unacceptable.  A total of €5 million has been wasted in salaries for officers to work in a new children's hospital which does not exist.  This money would have been better used in Crumlin and such funding should happen as a matter of urgency.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I am very happy that a benefactor has stepped forward and has indicated that he or she is prepared to fund Jamie Murphy's operation and I wish Jamie all the best.  What struck me about the responses I received about Jamie's case and the recent debate is the use of the word, "emergency" and the definition of emergency.  The response I received from the Minister in Jamie's case stated that no child has been denied access to emergency life-saving surgery due to the hospital's financial break-even programme.  If this is the case, why did this child need an anonymous donor to fund her operation in London?  The family made it clear to me that the consultant made it clear to them the grave necessity of an immediate operation and the dire consequences of her not having that operation immediately.  This was an emergency and it was delayed.In the case of another young girl I refer to a letter from a GP to the consultant in Crumlin.  The GP writes that he is aware of the situation with regard to the waiting list and the constraints put on the consultant with regard to doing this surgery.  He writes that it is very distressing for her parents and for himself to see this girl with this condition having to wait an inordinate length of time to have the operation.  He writes that it is a terrible pity that she has to deteriorate to a huge degree before she can have this essential surgery.  He writes that he will be sending a copy of the letter to the HSE and to a TD in the hope of highlighting the problem with regard to the long waiting list.  He writes that her family are quite adamant that they do not want to take the place of another equally seriously ill child on the waiting list.In my opinion, " a huge deterioration" in the case of a teenage girl is an emergency situation.I refer to another case which came to my attention in the past few weeks.  I received a letter from a GP which states:This lady has asked me to forward details of her situation to your office.  She presented in December 2008 with severe scoliosis, spinal curvature.  This is progressive and has deteriorated considerably since that date and this is documented by repeated plane X-rays.  She has been assessed by the consultant in Crumlin and is on a waiting list for surgery.  Prior to surgery if she requires an MRI scan, the earliest this can be done in Crumlin in the public system is early October 2009.  Therefore, it will be at least a year before she will have urgent corrective spinal surgery in Crumlin.  Her long-term outlook and degree of disfigurement  would be greatly improved by the earliest possible surgical intervention.  Next year is her leaving certificate so it was hoped originally to have surgery this summer so as not to interrupt her studies.  In my opinion, disfigurement for a teenage girl is an emergency.This morning on TV3 I watched a spokesperson for the HSE make the case that the situation was unacceptable but that it was up to the hospital not the HSE to deal with it.  I noted the same attitude and the same approach in the Dáil this morning.  This requires leadership.  It is unacceptable to pass the buck back to the hospital and to swap responsibility between the Government and the HSE.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	642	Having listened to the debate tonight and last night Members, including those in the Government parties, should know the depth of feeling that surrounds the protection of our children, particularly when their health and well-being is threatened.  This feeling is more intense when life saving and life improving procedures have been identified and cannot be implemented because of budgetary measures, or an absence of such measures.We have all heard and read the heart rending stories of children and their parents who have been forced to publicise their cases in an effort to receive vital treatment.  I am sure this is not a pleasant situation for many of them.  They would prefer to receive the services they need and deserve without such publicity.  These stories represent a very small number of the 24,000 day cases, the 30,000 emergency department attendees and the 80,000 out-patients who visit Crumlin hospital annually.  Crumlin hospital is our largest children's hospital, providing up to 80% of tertiary or highly specialised care for children across the State.  It touches so many families and communities.Children who are ill cannot survive without vital intervention.  Everyone in this, so called, civilised society should be outraged at the way we treat these vulnerable children.  I saw the statement issued by Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin this week.  It outlines the background to the situation in which the hospital finds itself this year.  In 2007, the hospital funding was €9 million less than its expenditure.  That shortfall was resolved as a once off payment.  In 2008, funding was €14.4 million less than the hospital's projected spend.  The HSE became involved and the shortfall was halved to €7 million by non-replacement of staff and management and by pay and non-pay issues.  In 2009, expenditure is estimated to be almost €138 million.  We are talking today of a shortfall of the order of €9 million in that projected budget.I am glad the Joint Committee on Health and Children visited Crumlin hospital yesterday and saw the situation there.  I have personal experience of the hospital as one of my children was treated there.  I am sure many Members of the House have been touched by it.  Everyone wishes the best for the hospital.  It is recognised as the best.  The hospital integrates families and provides a child focused recovery.  These effective procedures, developed through many years of experience, have been outlined by many speakers today.The Minister for Health and Children and the Taoiseach spoke of the need for Crumlin hospital to operate within a budget.  This restriction cannot apply.  More children are being born and procedures which were previously unheard of are now possible.  Outcomes, particularly in the area of cardiac care, are much better.  Premature babies now survive, many of them with complications which need intervention.  All of this points to the fact that inputs into Crumlin and the number of patients attending there have increased.  An economic restriction such as this should not apply.We need the different approach which has been outlined by the Fine Gael spokesperson.  In our FairCare approach, the money would follow the patient.  It does not make sense to ask a hospital like Crumlin, where numbers are increasing on an annual basis, to live within a budget.  It certainly does not make sense to the children who find themselves without life saving services.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	643	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy James Reilly, on spearheading this motion on behalf of every vulnerable child across the country.  This debate on the children's hospital in Crumlin epitomises everything that is wrong with the Irish health service.  The fact that we had to bring this debate into Dáil Éireann shows that the HSE and the Minister have no sense of priority and no compassion for the most vulnerable in our society.  The lesson I learn from the Crumlin story is that the HSE and the Minister have no idea what the parents of a sick child go through when they see their child pining away in front of their eyes, while waiting for the miracle surgery that will give their child a fighting chance to live a normal life.Crumlin children's hospital is different from most medical institutions.  There is hardly a family in any townland, village, town or city in the country which has not been touched by the sheer professionalism, dedication to duty and proven track record of the best medical brains, not in Ireland or Europe but in the world.  Crumlin hospital is embedded in the psyche of most Irish people.  I have heard people say a thousands times that Crumlin is the place where small miracles are performed on small children every day of the week.  They believe that to be the case, and so do I.Most people outside this House believe it has little relevance to any subject matter.  Whatever one says about Dáil Éireann, were it not for Dr. Reilly and the opportunity he has given the House, fewer people would have been seen in Crumlin this summer.  It is a shame that even following this debate, one ward will be closed this summer.I do not wish to be too political, but this is a political arena.  The game is up for the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE.  No one at a leadership level, either in Government or the HSE, knows the terrible grinding pressure on young parents when they see a child with, for example, a severe heart complaint unable to access the life giving procedures that are part and parcel of Crumlin.We all know that the news is not always good in Crumlin.  However, there is a world of difference between a situation where everything medically possible has been done for a child and one where a child did not get the required help on time.  What galls parents is that when such facilities are available their child can be denied access at the crucial moment.  That is what is wrong with closing the ward in Crumlin hospital.When Government backbenchers are down the country they give the impression to parents that they will do everything possible to ensure that Crumlin hospital does what it is so good at.  They will have an opportunity in half an hour's time.  We will see how many of them follow like sheep up the steps to the division lobby.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	644	Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is such an evocative name.  It is one of the primary hospitals in the country for the treatment and care of sick children.  Children from all over the country are sent there for medical treatment of various illnesses and conditions.  The hospital has long been synonymous with the provision of quality treatment and care.  It has enjoyed an excellent reputation and commands great respect.In view of the cutbacks children will be turned away.  That is the reality.  Worried parents will be caused more stress and anxiety for a saving of €9 million.  With some applied thinking this money could be saved in many ways.  The hospital issued a statement yesterday saying it wanted to reassure children and families that all emergencies will be catered for and the hospital will do everything it can to protect the sickest patients.  I have no doubt the staff of Crumlin will work conscientiously to ensure this is the case.  However, in the same statement the hospital admits that the measures will mean longer waiting times for some children for clinical assessment and non-emergency surgery.  Most parents will tell you the most anxious time is awaiting a diagnosis after their GP has become concerned that something is wrong with their child that requires further investigation.  Prolonging the wait for assessment and, subsequently, treatment will add greatly to the burden of stress and anxiety.It is similar for parents of children requiring non-emergency surgery.  The condition might not be life threatening but the surgery is required for good reason and delaying it will certainly affect the child's quality of life and health.  In some cases, delaying such treatment will mean turning non-emergency situations into emergencies.  A total of 25 beds and one operating theatre will remain closed at the hospital.  This is a very serious reduction of important services in this hospital.A four year old little girl named Mollie D'Arcy, the daughter of my cousin, was diagnosed with a major heart defect when she was four weeks old.  The quality of the service and the standard of professionalism in that hospital for my family were nothing short of magnificent.  Mollie's dad, Nicky, who is my first cousin, spent four months at the hospital.  When Mollie was four months old she had a heart transplant.  The service was magnificent.  To cut it back or change it for money is reprehensible.  It should not and cannot happen.  I have been fortunate to see the benefit to a member of my family of that good service.  To change it is nothing short of appalling.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	645	I met with the board of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, about three weeks ago.  We had a very good discussion about the future and the problems the hospital is facing this year.  I appealed to the board then, and repeat the appeal now, that it buy into the new pediatric hospital for Dublin.  We have been dragging our feet on this issue for too long.  The proposal was first made in 2006; three years later we are still waiting for Crumlin hospital to commit to it.Lest there be any doubt, I acknowledge, like Deputy D'Arcy and other Deputies, the wonderful work that is done in Crumlin children's hospital.  However, we must deal with the real world here.  We need a single pediatric hospital in the city, as was established by the McKinsey report in 2006.  Since then there have been potential judicial reviews, all sorts of position papers and, in my view, we have been buried in medical politics.  The main argument against establishing this hospital on the Mater site has been its location.  It is argued that it is a tight site, it is hard to get to and has no parking.  However, Temple Street hospital, which is 400 yards down the road, has no parking and is difficult to access.  The two main hospitals in London, Guy's Hospital and Great Ormonde Street Hospital, have no parking but nobody argues about that.

This is a huge national issue but we end up having these debates and listening to the stories about sick children.  It will happen again and again until we, as politicians, grasp this nettle.  We must put vested interests to one side, now more than ever.

These are issues that the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, has managed to avoid addressing.  It is what happens during the rest of this year that is of immediate relevance.The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney's main focus in her speech last night, like that of Deputy Barry Andrews tonight, was on the construction of the promised new national pediatric hospital to be built in 2014.  She also talked about seeking to integrate services between Tallaght, Crumlin and Temple Street.  She dealt with the vital issues of services currently available in Crumlin children's hospital more as debating points than as the Minister in charge of our health service.  Much of what she said was largely a red herring with regard to the current funding difficulties confronting the hospital and the anxiety of parents to ensure that children receive vital treatment.Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, is an efficiently run hospital of excellence, providing a continuously developing service to an increasing population of children.  Dispassionate talk of cutbacks and financial savings by the Minister is merely a euphemism for depriving children of essential medical treatment and surgery.  It is phraseology used to conceal the reality, which the hospital has acknowledged, that there will be longer waiting times for children for vital clinical assessment.  Nowhere in her speech did the Minister refer to the closure of St. Joseph's ward — the Minister of State with responsibility for children did not refer to it either — or the closure of a theatre.  She did not address the increasing waiting list of children suffering from scoliosis and requiring urgent surgery.  Nowhere did she address the impact of €9 million in cutbacks, which will lead to an estimated reduction of outpatient appointments of over 8,000 and 1,100 fewer hospital admissions.The hospital announced on Monday evening there was a threat of closure of a second ward with 20 beds and a second theatre.  The Minister last night welcomed the hospital's announcement that these closures will not take place in July and August, but neither the Minister nor the hospital has guaranteed the closures will not take place in September, with a consequent further dramatic reduction in admissions and essential surgery and treatment.The Minister does not present as somebody in charge of the health service.  In her speech she came across as a semi-detached commentator on the service.  While she acknowledged that nothing concerns parents more than the health of their children, she had nothing meaningful to say to parents who are distraught because essential surgery will be delayed or postponed by the cutbacks for which she is responsible.  She had nothing to say about the impact of postponement or delay on a child's quality of life or, in the case of scoliosis, about the long-term risk posed on attaining adulthood.  Ministerial talk of "efficiency savings" which we heard last night is merely Orwellian newspeak for depriving children of access to essential medical care.The Minister is a capable debater.  Ten days ago she spoke eloquently about the State's failures that were graphically described in the Ryan commission report.  This report, she acknowledged, confronts us with an awful truth — the fact that we should be ashamed of our past with regard to our treatment of children.  The truth is the Minister should be ashamed of her present with regard to her direct responsibility for depriving children of treatment.  She should be ashamed that she is presiding over and defending a health service that has a pediatric hospital of excellence whose staff is being forced to turn children and their parents away from its doors.  The motion on the Ryan commission report committed this House to cherishing all of the children of the nation equally.  There is terrible hypocrisy and deceit in this Government and the Minister for Health and Children being party to such a motion and within days betraying their obligation to children in need of medical care.Members of the previous and current Fianna Fáil-led Governments have engaged in political soapbox oratory about children's rights and their welfare.  There has been talk of a constitutional referendum.  Most recently, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, climbed onto the soapbox when speaking on the Ryan commission report and pretended that the Green Party had some commitment to a children's rights amendment to the Constitution, despite the fact that the only Green Party member of the children's rights committee, Deputy Paul Gogarty, has attended only approximately four of the approximately 50 meetings of that committee.The truth is that soapbox oratory is not matched by action.  Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney — who, at this stage, has practically re-entered the Fianna Fáil Party — regularly throw shapes but have no commitment of any nature to children's rights, in this case, the basic right of a child in a civilised democratic society to gain access to medical care.Yes, we are in the middle of a recession and cutbacks in Government expenditure are essential.  In making cutbacks, however, there are values to be protected, principles to be applied and priorities to be recognised.  The utter failure of the Government to recognise that providing essential medical treatment to children must remain a continuing priority starkly illustrates the extent to which it is both politically and morally bankrupt.  It is bereft of any recognisable principles or values.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	668	I start by reminding the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, that this debate is not about the Never-Never Land of a paediatric national hospital but about cutbacks of today that are hurting children who are in pain and suffering today.  It is about today.I will not repeat all that I said last night but I must remind people of the efficiency of Crumlin hospital, its increased productivity in day and theatre cases and in outpatients.  Some of the statements comparing it to Birmingham have been refuted already.  Birmingham's inpatient and day cases were matched with Crumlin's inpatient cases on their own.  This is disingenuous at best.I reiterate what I said last night about the needless pain that children will suffer because of delayed surgery.  They may need five episodes of surgery, with five episodes of post-surgical pain, where one would have more than sufficed.  I think of what Deputy Paul Connaughton said a few minutes ago and I realise the staff in Crumlin are stars — but the children are heroic.The Minister said last night that our document shows a 3% cut.  That is across all Departments, not across all hospitals.  If I were Minister for Health and Children, I would look to the hospitals that deliver the sort of efficiencies Crumlin delivers.  Under the money-to-follow-the-patient regime of budgeting we wish to bring in, Crumlin hospital would receive more money, not less, be allowed do more operations, not fewer, and would be allowed keep more of this country's children for treatment, not fewer.It matters greatly who the Minister for Health and Children is although last night the Minister tried to pretend otherwise.  She goes for the easy cut and does not look hard.  She is tough on children but not on reform.  I shall return to that point.  Is she tough on reforming the HSE?  There is no sign of it.  She goes after the weakest in society instead of going after waste in hospitals and in management.Concerning the working group idea which has been trotted out yet again, Crumlin hospital asked for this in 2007 but suddenly today it is the panacea for all our ills.  Last night there was talk about the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the cost of scoliosis treatment.  Under the NTPF, scoliosis treatment would not be as wasteful as certain other treatments because the surgeons in question are public surgeons who will not charge private fees if they do the work elsewhere.  Cappagh hospital is a public hospital.  There is no problem there.  What is stupid and inexcusable, however, is the closing down of a perfectly good theatre in Crumlin with its team in place, and referring the lot over to Cappagh.  To what end?  It is ludicrous and a waste of money.I return now to the budget of Crumlin hospital.  A speaker mentioned a figure of €144 million, which is incorrect.  The figure is €138 million from which the Government wants to take €9.1 million.  That sum of €138 million represents less than 1% of the €16 billion that we spend on health in general.  I remind the Minister of State that there are 1.25 million children in this country who represent over 30% of our population.  He wants to cut €9 million from their budget.The facts speak for themselves.  An elderly lady once said to me "You know, Doctor, the truth isn't fragile, it won't break."  I assure the Minister of State that in this case the truth will not break either.  I think of the disingenuity of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who suggested that treatment delays might be the patient's fault.  I shall return to that but now offer the point made to me by the doctors in Crumlin, namely, deferred treatment is always more expensive.  The money still has to be spent but more than likely there will be complications.Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the coldness of the Ministers last night.  I wrote that down on my page.  The cold dispassionate approach, seeing children as mere statistics, shown by the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, said more about their attitude than I could ever say.I shall read out some of the statements made by the Minister of State.  He said, "Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin is no different from any of our hospitals".  I guarantee to him that 1.25 million children in this country would believe otherwise.  He also said, concerning reasons for operations not taking place, "The patient may be deemed unfit to proceed, the procedure may be cancelled by the patient or the guardian".  How many times has that happened?  He went on to say, "There may be normal re-scheduling due to appointment times not being suitable".  That is code for "we cannot take you because of the cutbacks".  The Government has lost touch with the people in a major way.I wish to raise some other points in the few minutes that remain.  Why is there no national czar or leader for paediatrics in this country?  We have one for cancer.  How many patients with cancer are there in this country?  How many children?  Talk is cheap but action takes longer.  Let us not forget the 1.25 million children.  We talk about waste.  I asked last night why, when billions of euro are being provided for the bankers there are cutbacks for our children.I say to the Minister of State to look elsewhere for the savings, to look at the waste within the HSE.  I was challenged on this point last night by a claim there were only one or two such areas.  The sum of €60 million was paid for taxis.  A 10% saving in that area would yield €6 million.  Money spent on consultants to deconstruct the HSE amounted to €1 million.  Private consultants and spin doctors were paid €17 million.  In the HSE bureaucracy there were six Grade 8 personnel when it started. Now there are 700, all earning more than €80,000.  Advisors to the Government were paid €6.2 million.  There is the national drugs bill for which there was a €50 million shortfall in expected savings and no attempt made to prescribe generic drugs, by which hundreds of millions of euro could be saved.HSE banking inefficiencies cost €20 million per year.  Consultants' contracts face a spend of €50 million due to a loophole in the contract.  The hospitals' cleaning bill cost €578 million, up 54% since 2005.  We need them clean but we should not be cleaned out while we are doing it.  How many millions have been wasted on decentralisation of Government?  Professor Brendan Drumm said there were 3,000 to 4,000 people in the HSE who did not know what their jobs were.  All this waste, but the Minister of State wants to go after the children.Last night Deputy Mary White said she could not attend the hospital because she could not find a pairing.  My Whip told me that was not the case.  She is delighted about the very welcome news that Jamie Murphy will now have her operation abroad through the goodwill of a benefactor.  I, too, welcome the relief this will bring to the Murphy family.  However, what of the hundreds of other families and children?  The Deputy is silent on this matter.  Did she not say in this House two weeks ago that she would cherish all the children equally?  It is in her gift, as the deputy leader of the junior partner in Government.  Tonight she can bring that same joy and relief to hundreds of other families by voting for our motion to stop these cuts.

I do not accept that.  I was referring to a substantial part of the report which criticised the way Members handled complaints.  It is difficult for Members but I was merely responding to the report which was significant in respect of how the investigation took place.Some Members expressed sentiments, which were also expressed on Committee Stage, to the effect that we are out of kilter with neighbouring jurisdictions.  They said on Committee Stage that we are out of line with the practice in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  It is true that equivalent bodies in England and Wales have powers of surveillance, but the office of the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland has neither interception powers nor powers of surveillance.  Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 the ombudsman's office in Northern Ireland has powers of directed surveillance but those powers do not extend to either interception or the type of surveillance that is the subject of this legislation.  We are not out of kilter with our peers across the Border.  We checked this with the Northern authorities because it arose on Committee Stage and in the correspondence from the Human Rights Commission.  The extension of interception and surveillance powers to the Northern Ireland ombudsman's office is kept under review.  It is a relatively new organisation set up in 2001 and our own ombudsman commission has been modelled on that office.While in principle I believe we should examine this at a future stage, given that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission has been swamped with complaints since its inception in 2005, we need to give it time to operate.  When the 2005 legislation was drafted and approved by the House, we did not extend to the GSOC on the same basis the powers the Garda has under the 1983 legislation to intercept telephony and postal packages because it was a new organisation and should be given time.  I cannot say any more than that.  Deputy Charles Flanagan referred to the fact that the GSOC has a role under the Bill in that the legislation allows the complaints referee to refer a matter to the GSOC where he or she believes there has been a contravention of the legislation by the Garda.  I cannot accept the amendment.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	685	It seems odd that when the objective of the legislation is to prevent crime and murder and tackle gangs, the most contentious point seems to be whether we give powers to the GSOC against gardaí.  It takes away from the focus of the legislation which must be quite specific.  I agree with the Minister's approach that perhaps it will be necessary to give this power to the GSOC in the future but now we should act to tackle the criminals, get those boys and girls into jail and provide the Garda and the courts with the evidentiary powers in the legislation.  We should forget about the other matter for the moment and examine it in the future, as the Minister has stated.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I welcome Deputy Byrne's intervention and I agree that the intention of the legislation is to tackle crime.  As I stated on Committee Stage, if that crime is carried out by a person in uniform, it is even more appalling.  It is interesting that the Minister repeated what he stated on Committee Stage, that at some future stage we should examine this.  The same attitude was adopted with regard to the Garda Complaints Board, that at some future stage we might change it, give it more powers or make it more effective.  This did not happen and because it was so ineffective we, as a society, were forced to come up with the GSOC.  We do not want the same to be said about the GSOC in the future.  It is time to allow it to be able to operate and, as I stated earlier, it is hoped that it does not have to use these powers.  The time to act is now when we have an opportunity.  Who knows when the next Bill will come?  We might not have an opportunity in the future.  For the GSOC to work effectively it needs resources, not time.On the amendment itself I do not understand how providing this additional power does anything but increase the ability of the Garda Síochána to do its work and help a body which is tasked with ensuring crime within the Garda Síochána, or a culture that existed and was exposed by the Morris tribunal, is at an end and that those who would have an inkling towards it within the force, and I doubt there are many left, if any, understand that the full rigours of the law available to them as members of the Garda Síochána are also available to those who would investigate crime within the force.  I will press this amendment.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	687	In general, I welcome the Bill.  I spoke about it when it was published but I was not involved on Committee Stage.  It is all about what checks and balances are included in the Bill and at a level of principle, if we decide to give the Garda power to combat criminal gangs, once we have provided the constitutional protections required, we should leave it at that.  There is no point in introducing provisions to allow the Garda to carry out surveillance on criminals and use the information gathered as evidence in court but then trammel them with many sub-clauses that if they err, they are tripped up.The thrust of the Bill is to encroach on the constitutional rights of certain individuals.  Whenever surveillance is allowed under law it encroaches on the right to privacy of the individuals being surveilled and often on that of their families and social contacts as well.  It must be proportionate and necessary.  It is proper that the Minister should decide the Garda cannot go on a fishing expedition and that surveillance is confined to the search for information to be used in evidence which cannot be acquired otherwise by the Garda.  This is quite a severe restriction on the activity and I am not too sure how it will play out in practice.  I am not sure it is practicable.  Does it mean that if a sergeant in charge were to assign two gardaí to follow a particular vehicle around the town on a night the Garda resources to do so were available that a tracking device could not be used on that vehicle because the information could have been obtained through normal Garda activity?  That is just an aside.The safeguard that it must be a superior officer, a senior Revenue officer or a senior Army officer that instigates the surveillance in the first instance is appropriate, especially when the senior officer in question has to go to a District Court judge to get permission.  The mechanism whereby the referee can review situations subsequently is also proper and proportionate and the safeguards are being provided.The one area about which I have concern is the 72-hour provision, where recourse to a District Court judge is not required in certain situations of urgency.  This certainly will be open to challenge.  I appreciate that similar provisions are in place in other European jurisdictions but it is difficult in the first instance to envisage why it would be difficult as a matter of urgency to have recourse to a District Court judge.  Even if it is, one could envisage a situation arising where a person was kidnapped and being held to ransom, a District Court judge could not be found and surveillance devices were used to gather information or tracking devices were used on certain vehicles.I query the constitutionality of this provision.  In analogous legislation, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, there is recourse to a District Court judge and in the main provisions of this Bill there is recourse to a District Court judge.  I can see why the Garda authorities would consider it necessary to have a period of 72 hours without recourse to a District Court judge but will the Minister re-examine this provision to ensure its constitutionality?I do not know whether it was amended on Committee Stage but when I read the Bill originally the provision to surveil for a period of 72 hours could be done on the say so of a superintendent.  At a minimum that should be a chief superintendent.  Analogous provisions normally require the warrant of a chief superintendent rather than a superintendent.  In so far as possible the Minister should proof this provision against constitutional challenge.  There is no point in having provisions if subsequently they are attacked constitutionally and serious criminal activity goes unpunished because the law was flawed because we in these Houses did not do our job.  The Minister must proof this constitutionally and that is a weakness in theBill.I am not sure whether the ombudsman's office should be used.  The use of a district justice and the referee system to subsequently assess the manner in which the Act is applied gives adequate constitutional provision.  There is a mechanism for complainants through the referee system and this is analogous to the 1993 Act.  The ombudsman's role is different and the office in the short time it has operated has been effective, but when something is working well, we should not load every task on top of it.The provisions are adequate for the needs of the Bill to provide the constitutional safeguards necessary.  The opening position is the House on the advice of the Minister is deciding to invade the constitutional rights of certain individuals, principally the right to privacy, and that must be balanced with a series of safeguards in order that this is only done in exceptional circumstances, where it is necessary and proportionate to do so.  However, once the balance is struck, it is struck and the Minister has it right with the exception of the 72-hour provision where there is an element of doubt about whether the safeguards are sufficient.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	688	The amendments relate to the extension of powers and the proposal is to extend them to the GSOC.  The reason the Revenue Commissioners and the Defence Forces are included is in the fight against drug crime, in particular, the Garda, the Naval Service and the Revenue Commissioners through its customs and excise division operate together on a multi-agency basis.  Under its legislation, the GSOC's remit is restricted.  This legislation is designed to tackle arrestable crime, crime with a sentence of five years or more and serious crime.  I do not say gardaí are not capable of serious crime but we are examining amendments to the ombudsman commission's Act in conjunction with requests from the commission and we are discussing them with the Garda, which has views in this regard.  There might be an opportunity on another occasion to examine the extension because, in principle, I do not have a major issue with it but this is not the right time because the main focus of the legislation is on organised crime.I welcome Deputy Noonan's comments.  While we were criticised for not bringing the legislation forward earlier, he is absolutely correct that the Bill provides for invasive surveillance, which infringes on people's privacy.  With regard to his comment on the 72-hour provision, the superior officer must be satisfied under section 7(3) with the grounds for believing that an authorisation should be issued by a District Court judge.  He or she under section 7(11) must report to an assistant commissioner not later than seven days afterwards specifying the grounds on which the 72-hour approval was granted, including providing a copy of the written record of approval and a summary of the results of the surveillance.  While the Deputy is entitled to his view, I have provided for proper checks and balances in respect of his provision because it must be accepted if the situation is urgent, the Garda should have the ability to act in an urgent manner, provided it does so in a proportionate way.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	689	The GSOC will be disappointed that it is being disadvantaged in its capacity to discharge its function vis-à-vis  the Garda in this legislation.  The commission may take some comfort from the Minister saying it is only a matter of timing and the body is so new that he does not want to extend the power at this stage.  One may draw the inference from this that he may do so in the relatively near future, given that he is promising amending legislation for other reasons.However, the issue is the commission's responsibility to investigate arrestable offences.  As the Minster fairly said, that is a serious matter because we know we cannot rule out the possibility of a garda or gardaí being involved in serious crime.  The members of the commission argue that in the event of them being seized of such a matter, they would like to have available to them the same tools as the Garda if they are to investigate the matter.  This is the case in Wales and England.  The Minister will accept that he has changed his argument about Northern Ireland.  When the issue was raised on Committee Stage, he said a comparison could not be made with Northern Ireland because the policing scenario is different but now he is saying the interception powers are not provided there and, therefore, we are not out of kilter.The Minister made a remarkable comment in passing.  He said the GSOC is "swamped" and I am sure he did not say that lightly.  It is, therefore, extraordinary that it should have that many cases in front of it, even if some are mischievous.  All the commission is saying is that it wants the same instruments available to it as the Garda.I assure Deputy Byrne that nobody is trying to distract from the focus.  I published the Garda surveillance Bill on which the legislation is modelled.  This is the way legislation is dealt with.  He must be a diligent watcher of the monitor in his office if he knows that this is the most contentious issue because one certainly would not know it from the brevity of his infrequent visits to the committee.  He should not lecture us on what is most contentious in the Bill.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I welcome the legislation.  The focus is to ensure compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and to allow the Garda to comply with the convention in carrying out its duties while also giving officers the legal powers to carry out their duties in gathering evidence.  I tabled a number of amendments, some of which would add to the powers they have or make them more practical.We discussed this issue on Committee Stage and while the Minister dismissed the point raised about the Northern Ireland police ombudsman, he did not deny that under the Act governing the independent police compliance commission in Britain, certain of its officers are prescribed as being capable of authorising surveillance under section 30 of the regulation on investigatory powers.  I do not know how often that power has been used, if at all.Given what we now know occurred in Donegal and given other incidents where members of the Garda Síochána have been found guilty, often following investigation by their own colleagues who caught them in the act, we know gardaí have been found guilty of crimes that carry a sentence of more than five years.  Whether they got that sentence was up to the court.  We know from the Morris tribunal that gardaí were involved in fabricating evidence, interfering with witnesses, assaults and the manufacture and planting of explosives.  We also know of cases where gardaí were involved with drug smugglers, fraud, organised crime and major gangs.  This is a fact of life.Obviously, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission would not be involved in all such incidents, because that is the job of the Garda Síochána.  However, if I or any other member of society went in the first instance to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to complain about a garda who was not carrying out his or her duty, the commission would be duty bound to investigate that complaint, because the complaint would be about the garda in question.  For example, if I made an allegation of treason against a garda, the commission would have to investigate that, but the investigation would be very difficult because the commission operates from the outside in.One of the powers that might help the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, especially in a case where the commission believed there was an organised group involved within the Garda Síochána — as there was in Donegal — would be to have the same power as the members of the Defence Forces or members of the Revenue Commission to carry out surveillance.  This is not a power that is given lightly to any organisation and that is the reason we suggest giving it to a body set up by this House that has rules and regulations in terms of how it carries out its investigations.  Restrictions in the Bill would also apply to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which would mean the commission would have to justify its action to a court and ensure it was proportional and likely to be successful.This is the most contentious proposal we have put forward.  We agree with the thrust of the Bill and have welcomed it.  We are not making the Bill a contentious one; the Minister is doing that by not accepting any amendment, which is a pity.

In page 6, to delete lines 8 and 9.This is an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage.  The power referred to in this case is that the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purpose of maintaining the security of the State.  The amendment proposes the deletion of those words.  This is vague and does not add to the Bill.  Most of subsections (a) and (b) would cover all eventualities.  The related amendments in this section, amendments Nos. 16, 46, 49 and 56, which are all in my name, concern the same issue, namely, that the proposals are vague.  If we put forward such proposals, we need to be much more specific in what is proposed with regard to the security of the State so we do not duplicate what is in subsections (a) and (b).  Anything that would undermine the security of the State would, I presume, be an arrestable offence which would be covered under subsection (a) or (b), which state that surveillance is authorised for the purpose of preventing the commission of arrestable offences.  I believe most, if not all, of the issues which subsection (c) attempts to capture are captured under subsections (a) and (b).

The Deputy is trying to remove any reference to "the security of the State" right across the Bill, whether it is in regard to authorisation for surveillance under section 4, for the granting of an approval under section 7, as a reason not to publish matters contained in a report under section 12 or with regard to disclosure of information under sections 13 to 15.The Garda Síochána has a distinct and somewhat unusual role in that most other states have separate police agencies.  In our system, the Garda Síochána has the dual function of investigation of crime and the protection of the security of the State in its widest form.  To exclude that from the consideration of the ability of the Garda, the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners to deal with crimes affecting the security of the State would reduce the effectiveness of gardaí in defending this State against an attack in whatever shape or form it would happen.  I could not accede to the removal of the reference to "the security of the State" in a number of sections  because it is a core function of the Garda Síochána and to accept the amendment would restrict gardaí in regard to normal crime as well as issues of protecting the State against national and international terrorism and other crimes.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.

This country does not have an MI5 or MI6 and the Garda Síochána carries out the intelligence functions as well as the policing functions of the State.  Although there is a minor intelligence unit in the Army, by and large, what was traditionally known as the special branch or the security intelligence unit of the Garda Síochána carries out these functions.  It is appropriate to have reference to "the security of the State" in new provisions of surveillance being given to the Garda.

In amendment No. 46, "the security of the State" is substituted by "current or future criminal prosecutions".  The Bill seeks to ensure surveillance for the purpose of gaining criminal prosecutions against those who are carrying out crime or likely to do so.  I believe the term "the security of the State" is too loose and the intention is to delete it and to allow for all arrestable crimes to be covered either by section 4(1)(a) or 4(1)(b) in the context of amendment No. 10, which we are discussing at present, and of the other amendments.I will not press the amendment as it is not that big an issue but we should in law try to have descriptive terms.  Where terms such as "the security of the State" are being used, we need to explain in greater detail what is involved and not duplicate the reasoning for the surveillance.  The reason for the surveillance in this instance is to get the information required to bring about a successful prosecution, which is catered for at section 4(1)(a) and 4(1)(b).  As I noted, the substitution in amendment No. 46 of  the term “the security of the State” with the term “current or future criminal prosecutions” would cover this and mean the Garda Síochána could do its job, gain prosecutions and ensure the information is gathered.

In page 6, to delete lines 44 and 45 and substitute the following:5.—(1) An application under section 4 for an authorisation and under section 6 for a variation or renewal of an authorisation—(a) shall be made ex parte and shall be heard otherwise than in public, and(b) may be made to a judge assigned to any district court district.I indicated on Committee Stage that I would introduce amendments in regard to the issuing of authorisations for surveillance by the District Court.  These amendments allow an application for a surveillance authorisation, under section 5 of the Bill, to be made to a District Court judge in any District Court district.  The application will be valid in all parts of the State.In general, applications of this nature are made to the District Court in the district in which the subject of the application is resident or is located.  The amendment to subsection (1), however, makes it clear that an application for an authorisation to carry out surveillance can be made in any District Court district.  This is to address the fact that, in may cases, a proposed surveillance operation will involve a group of subjects — for example, a group of persons or vehicles — who are resident or located in more than one District Court district or who cannot be said to be resident or located in any given district.The second amendment, the insertion of a new subsection (9), provides that an authorisation issued by a judge of the District Court will have effect, not only in the district to which the District Court judge is assigned and in which the authorisation issued, but also in any other part of the State.  This is particularly important given that the subjects of surveillance, both persons and objects, will, by their very nature, usually be mobile and therefore capable of moving between District Court districts.  Provision for flexibility in the judicial authorisation process will ensure the legislation is practical from an operational point of view.I commend the amendments to the House.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I met a young farmer last week who showed me his milk returns for last month from his 40-cow herd.  He was paid just over 19 cent a litre.  This well educated and sensible young man literally had tears in his eyes, tears of frustration and anger.  He proceeded to tell me how the cheque, the biggest he will receive this year, simply will not cover fertiliser and feed bills accrued during the months of April and May of this year which witnessed the worst weather conditions for 50 years.  If the Minister of State is not aware of this situation then it is a case of shame on him.  No one could produce milk at 19 cent per litre and one can imagine the problems farmers have in the wetland areas in which land has not been grazed for more than 12 months, simply because of waterlogging.  We are witnessing the wind-down of the one of the most noble farming enterprises and if urgent action is not taken by the EU Commission and the Government, another sugar beet debacle will be on our hands.There is no respect for primary producers of food in the country.  In the case of milk, the farmer gets one third of the price of a bottle, the processor gets one third and the supermarket gets the final third.  Who is walked upon in this case?  Who puts in seven days a week, takes all the risks and who comes out the worst?  I need not tell the Minister of State it is the farmer.I put on record that the EU Commission must smarten up.  More and greater volumes of milk product must be allowed into EU intervention and more funding to aid private storage schemes must be made available at rates that will keep dairy farmers afloat until world prices creep upwards.  Matters within the control of Ireland must be re-examined also.  The budget in October of last year will cripple farmers next October.  Let us consider the savage cuts coming down the line.  These include €1,000 off the top rate of the area base payment, which affects those in the wetland areas throughout Ireland, a reduction of 50% in the cow welfare scheme from €80 to €40, and a reduction of more than 2% in modulation in so far as the single farm payment is concerned.  Let us consider the reduction in the REP 4 scheme from a maximum of €10,000 to €8,000.  When these are added up an ordinary, average farmer in the country stands to lose €6,000 directly from his or her pocket next October or November and this bears no relationship to what such farmers earn.During the last election there was a good deal of talk, rightly, of levies because they affected everyone.  However, this levy works out at approximately 30% on the normal income that most average farmers will earn this year.  Unless the Government takes action and reverses some of these cuts, which are entirely within its remit, there will be a catastrophe in the farming community of the country before the year is through.  I realise many will say this is a case of the farmers crying foul again, but that is not the case this time.  Every enterprise is under great attack.The members of the Government should get up on their bicycles and go after the European Commission.  I recognise the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was in Luxembourg recently but it seems he has no clout and the process is going nowhere at present.  If the Minister of State were a dairy farmer milking his cows seven days a week he would realise the severity of the situation.  My background is farming and this is the first time in my memory that I have ever seen a situation in which for every marginal gallon of milk produced one is losing money.  The price is below the cost of production.Let us consider the case of a person highly geared, who cannot get grants from the Department, although such grants were guaranteed.  If one puts all the pieces together it amounts to a very significant problem in the farming community.  On behalf of every farmer in Ireland I call on the Minister of State to put his shoulder to the wheel and do something positive to try to get the whole industry on a better footing before it is too late.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	705	On milk prices I point out that since last November when it became apparent that dairy commodity prices were in decline internationally from the record prices of only 12 months earlier, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, has been in close contact with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Mariann Fischer Boel, and has been very active at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council to press for the activation of dairy market supports.  These had been suspended since 2006 because of the historically high milk prices which prevailed in the intervening period.  The Commission has taken a series of measures with a view to stabilising the market, commencing with the introduction of an aid scheme for the private storage of butter, some two months ahead of the normal date.  This scheme remains in place and has already supported the storage of some 96,000 tonnes of butter.In January export refunds were re-introduced for butter, cheese, skimmed milk powder and whole milk powder and this has enabled the export of considerable volumes of dairy products.  In March, public intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder was opened.  When the agreed intervention limit was reached the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, obtained the Commissioner's agreement for the continuation of these schemes under tendering arrangements at close to intervention prices.  To date, some 81,000 tonnes of butter have been intervened with a further 202,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder having been purchased into stock.  In all, some 20,000 tonnes of butter and 27,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder from Ireland have been stored under the schemes.At the EU Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers on Monday the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, again stressed the need to take further steps to assist in reversing the downturn and stimulating the market further.  For example, intervention purchases of butter and skimmed milk powder are due to close at the end of August and the private storage scheme for butter shortly beforehand.  The role that private storage plays in particular, but intervention too, is such that their continuation after the normal end dates will be crucial in preventing further market turbulence at a time when supplies would otherwise hit commercial markets.  The Minister also called on the Commissioner to increase export refunds for butter and skimmed milk powder even further and to suspend the free at frontier price for cheeses enabling cheeses products to avail of export refunds.  The dairy sector will remain at the top of our agenda in the coming months.The Deputy referred to proposed reductions in farmer payments.  However, he may not be aware that following representations from Ministers from several member states including the Minster, Deputy Brendan Smith, the EU Commissioner agreed to allow for an advance payment of 70% with effect from 16 October under the single payment scheme.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	709	It is a sensible change in the rules.  It will mean that farmers will no longer have to wait for six months for a refund of deductions amounting to €350 in most cases.With regard to budgetary decisions in general, Deputies will be aware that these were made in the context of the deterioration in the overall economic and financial environment.  Our approach has been to strike a careful balance between increased borrowing, higher taxation and reduced spending.  Clearly, there will be consequences for every sector of society.  The Government has agreed a five-year plan with the EU Commission to secure stability and growth.  In agriculture, the objective has been to protect the most productive elements of the agriculture, food, fisheries and forestry sectors and to ensure they continue to make the maximum contribution to the economy.  It is vital that the sector be well positioned to get through this very challenging period and to exploit the opportunities that will develop as the international and national economies recover.Against this overall background, one could easily forget the Government has provided more than €1.9 billion in the Department's Vote in 2009.  When combined with EU funding of €1.4 billion, this means total expenditure by the Department in support of the agri-food and fisheries sectors this year will exceed €3.3 billion.The agriculture and food sector has the capacity to help lead the nation's economic recovery in the years ahead.  This is regardless of the economic difficulties Ireland currently faces.  There is no doubt the country is fully capable of producing and exporting high quality food and drink products.  Despite the challenging market, currency fluctuations and turbulent export environment, food and beverage exports in 2008 were worth approximately €8.2 billion to our economy.  The agri-food sector represents our most important indigenous industry and has the potential to boost export returns substantially in the future.The EU medium-term outlook for agricultural commodities foresees a gradual recovery supported by growth in global food demand due to population increase and also a long-term decline in the growth of food-crop productivity.  These factors can work to the advantage of Ireland.  Agriculture and food production are always subject to change and challenges and while agriculture is often more resilient to economic crises than other sectors, there is no doubt that certain parts of the industry are facing significant challenges this year.  We will continue to work to help the entire agri-food sector remain competitive such that it may capitalise on the inevitable global recovery.Addressing the industry's capacity to compete successfully at home and overseas has assumed a new urgency and my belief is that a new development plan for the period to 2020 is required to maintain the impetus gained from the very successful Agri-Vision 2015 strategy.  Preparatory work has already started on this plan which is focusing on the critical issue of competitiveness, the challenges from the global economic downturn, currency fluctuations, climate change and how best to maximise the opportunities arising from a growing international food and energy crop markets.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	710	The issue I wish to raise is almost identical to that raised by Deputy Connaughton.  It is ironic that he comes from the west and I come from Munster from the heart of what is probably the best dairying, farming and agricultural county in the country.  Over the past number of months I have seen at first hand the anger and frustration of the dairy farmers and the dairy industry in particular.  Some weeks ago I stood outside Tipperary Co-Op where hundreds of farmers protested at the decision by the board of the co-op to reduce milk prices.  The anger I saw there was the same as the anger I saw when the medical cards were being taken from the old age pensioners and they protested outside in Kildare Street.  These farmers were losing their income and were unable to pay their bills to the banks.  They had borrowed heavily to invest in their farms and to comply with regulations and to improve their farms so that their sons and their families could earn a living.  I saw that anger at first hand.  The anger was directed at the Government, at the management of the co-op and at the banks who do not care and have no interest in the future of these farming families.When the subject of agriculture and keeping people on the land on viable holdings is being discussed, we need answers from the banks.  Right across this country many bank managers are putting pressure on farmers to repay loans and are refusing to honour cheques.  The reason this is happening is that milk prices have reduced so drastically.  A price of 20 cent a litre and in some cases down to 19 cent a litre is what is being paid to farmers.  It is not viable to continue milk production at that price.  No serious effort is being made by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to make a case to Brussels in order to protect those people.  We saw on television the anger of farmers from all over Europe.  We were represented at that protest by the IFA and probably the ICMSA and others.  The reality is that our farmers could not afford to travel to Brussels to make their protest because they are not able to pay their bills.The farmers want the Minister to put a package together, which is what happened in the 1980s when farmers were in extreme difficulty as is the case today.  Nobody is giving leadership.  The Government needs to take a lead and put a package together to include the banks and the European Union.  It must be seen what can be made available to subsidise storage for the products being produced by the farmers.  This is where the problem lies.I hope for a response from the Minister of State.  Right across the country, whether in Clare, Tipperary, Galway, Longford or any other county, most of those counties depend on agriculture.  If that industry dies on its feet, we will be very sorry.  I am hoping for a very good response from the Minister of State.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	711	Like all sectors of the economy, agriculture is facing very challenging times at present.  The world recession is having an impact both on demand for agricultural products and on the cost base under which farmers are producing their goods for the market.We have seen a severe downturn in the dairy sector which has not been helped by the international financial crisis.  The Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, recognises that dairy farmers are facing tremendous difficulties, with their prices below the cost of production and the prospects for recovery in the short term poor.  Indeed, it is for this reason that the Minister has consistently urged the European Commission to make all efforts to support and stabilise the situation and to take effective measures that will stimulate the market.There are also a number of difficulties in the sheep sector.  Sheep numbers are declining, demand continues to fall in our main export market and while generic promotional campaigns have been put in place, there continues to be an uphill struggle for our producers.  Our cattle sector is not immune from these difficulties either.  It faces challenging times ahead with increased competition from low cost producers in third countries who will inevitably at a particular point in the future manage to meet the very high standards of production and quality required by the EU.  Against this background, in the negotiations last year on the CAP health check, the Minister managed to secure access to additional EU funding to fund a suite of measures under the single payments regulation, targeted at vulnerable areas, particular sectors under pressure, improvement of animal welfare and-or agri-environment measures.The use of unspent single payment funds is a new concept.  Deputy Smith was the first Minister to raise this possibility in the context of the health check negotiations.  We were delighted to have the support of most of our counterparts from other member states and the agreement of the Commission for this idea.  The funds arise because the rules surrounding the single payment system mean that not all entitlements to payment can be drawn down.  The amount of unspent funds available each year is based on the difference between the fixed annual ceiling for 2007 for these payments and the actual draw-down for that year, less a safety margin.  The actual draw-down will vary from year to year, depending on the number of entitlements claimed.  However, broadly speaking, the outcome means that Ireland will have access to approximately €25 million in additional funding in each of the next three years from 2010 to 2012, to spend on these targeted measures.We have already secured an amount of €7 million in respect of 2009.  The Minister decided some months ago that these funds should be directed at the sheep sector in the form of an uplands sheep payment.  Under the scheme, approximately 14,000 hill sheep farmers will benefit from the new payment this year.  On the basis of data available for 2008, the level of aid will be of the order of €35 per hectare with a maximum payment of €525 per farmer.  Payments will commence on 1 December 2009.In introducing this payment our main objective was to address the difficulties and specific costs, including compliance costs, facing the sheep sector.  In reaching his decision the Minister was mindful of the need to ensure that it created no additional burden for farmers and was simple and inexpensive to administer.  This payment, for which we sought and secured the agreement of the Commission, is for 2009 alone.  In respect of 2010 and beyond, we have consulted widely with stakeholders on this matter and are well aware of their wishes.  The Minister will be making his decision in the coming weeks and he will then submit Ireland's plans for use of these funds to the European Commission for approval.These are not the only funds that will become available to Ireland over the coming years.  Funds totalling €134 million will also become available over the four years from 2010 to 2013, from additional modulation agreed in the CAP health check and the rural development element of the European economic recovery package.  These funds must be directed at measures addressing the new challenges of climate change, water management, bio-energy, biodiversity and diary restructuring.  We are close to finalising the consultation process on the use of these funds and the Minister will be announcing his decision in due course.  Our proposals for spending must also be agreed with the European Commission in a revised rural development programme we will be submitting to the Commission next month.While I am not in a position to announce detailed funding proposals today, it is worth noting that this means EU funding of some €216 million for the Irish agriculture sector.  The injection of this level of funding into the sector will have a significant positive impact on Irish farming and will assist our farmers in meeting the challenges facing them in the years ahead.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	713	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to discuss this important matter regarding the convent primary school, Rochfortbridge, County Westmeath, roll number 14603J.  There is an urgent need for the Minister to reconsider the decision to suppress the eighth mainstream teacher post in the convent primary school, from September 2009.  The enrolment in this school on 30 September 2008 was 206 pupils, one above the retention figure for September 2009 prior to the cutbacks announced in budget 2008.  From September 2008 to January 2009, the enrolment fluctuated marginally upwards from 206 to 211 at the beginning of this year.  This puts the school well above the retention figure of 207 required to retain the post for 2009 under the new guidelines.  The reality of the loss of a teacher for this school, which has 42 pupils enrolled for junior infants in the new term in September, is that it will be forced to put children into multi-grade groupings of up to 31 per class.The Rochfortbridge primary school, with rising numbers of pupils, has already outgrown its built environment, with three temporary classrooms or pre-fabs already required.  The classrooms in the school are much smaller than average and incapable of holding amalgamated groupings.  This poses a serious health and safety issue.  This school accepts special needs children and it is obvious that those in this category in the lower classes will suffer educationally from large class groupings in the most formative years of their education.One of the most important factors to remember is that schools such as Rochfortbridge convent primary were not built to accommodate the number of pupils that have applied for places, due to new housing developments and rising population figures that pertain today.  This presents the school with a valid concern for health and safety.I have said before about other schools in my constituency that are housed in substandard, outdated accommodation that the buck stops with the Minister and his Department and accidents caused by overcrowding and substandard buildings are directly their responsibility.Rochfortbridge convent primary is a victim of its own success. The dedicated work of the principal, the board of management and the staff is much appreciated in the locality.  It is a much sought after school serving the area and is caught in a catch-22 situation in terms of rising numbers.  The school was coping well despite the limitations on space with eight mainstream teachers, but the loss of one will place it in an untenable position.  It is unfair to pupils, teachers and parents to deprive this school of its most valuable educational tool — one of its much needed and highly regarded teachers.I am asking the Minister to reconsider the educational, health and safety and child centred needs of the pupils of the convent primary school Rochfortbridge and allow it to retain this much needed teacher.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, Minister for Education and Science.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment today.The Minister for Education and Science is committed to providing information on the allocation of teachers to schools and as a new feature on the Department's website.  The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.In terms of the position at individual primary school level, the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by the Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking these enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data have since been received and processed in the Department, enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.The Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September 2009.  As part of the Minister's efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public, detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on the Department's website.  This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is the Minister's intention to have this information updated, and ultimately, to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly, to which I have already referred, and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the primary staffing appeals board will have been considered.At its meeting on 14 May 2009, the appeal board considered an appeal submitted by the board of management of Rochfortbridge convent primary school.  The appeal was considered under section 10 of the primary staffing schedule (circular 02/2009) which is available on the Department's website at  www.education.ie.  The appeal board decided that a departure from the staffing schedule was not warranted in this case and therefore refused the appeal on the grounds that the required pupil numbers were not validly enrolled in September or October 2008 in this school.The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.

These promote high quality, sustainable residential development at all levels of the urban hierarchy, including towns and villages.  The Guidelines provide more specific advice on coordinated planning and development of such areas.  Best practice examples and processes to implement the Guidelines were provided in an accompanying Urban Design Manual.The Retail Planning Guidelines for Planning Authorities support the vibrancy and vitality of city, town and village centres. My Department will carry out a limited review of these Guidelines later this year.  In addition, my Department will prepare draft guidelines on local area plans which are statutorily required for all towns with a population in excess of 2,000 people and which are increasingly used in the planning of strategic developments.

I published the report, entitled A Preliminary Study on the Establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland, for consultation on 10 February 2009, with a closing date for submissions of 26 June 2009.  The report is available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.  In addition to a public call for submissions to the consultation process, input has been sought from a number of bodies and organisations with a specific interest in the electoral system. These include the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Standards in Public Office Commission, all registered political parties in the State, as well as bodies representing Returning Officers and Local Authorities.In developing and bringing forward proposals for the establishment of an Electoral Commission, I will take into account the report prepared by the UCD group and views put forward as part of the consultation process.

Failure to comply with this statutory requirement constitutes an offence, which may, on successful prosecution, result in a fine not exceeding €5,000.Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the 37 local Building Control Authorities. I am not aware of any prosecutions having been initiated to date in respect of non-compliance with BER requirementsArrangements for the National BER Assessors examination are now fully in place.  I understand from SEI that the first examinations will take place in the first week of July 2009.BER requirements apply within the social housing sector.  The Regulations do not however set any minimum energy rating requirement that must be achieved for social housing or for any category of buildings.Some 50,000 BER certificates have been issued to date in respect of dwellings; the corresponding number of BER certificates in respect of buildings other than dwellings is almost 1,000.

In particular, the Change campaign, led by a consultancy consortium was launched in November 2007 with the specific objective of raising public awareness of climate change, its causes, impacts and implications for Ireland and to promote behavioural change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A budget of €4.13m (including VAT) has been allocated to the campaign for 2009.  Among the initiatives supported are the following:The development of the carbon management tool, which I launched at the end of April.  This online tool is being provided free of charge to all organisations to enable them calculate and reduce their organisations' emissions and reduce their costs as a result;The ongoing development of the website as a key source of information on climate change, its impacts and implications. It provides information on policies and measures taken by Government to address climate change as well as actions being taken by communities by way of example to others.  The website also features a calculator for individuals to measure their carbon number and provides information on actions to take to reduce it;Consumer and business multi-media advertising campaigns designed to increase awareness and drive consumer and organisational behavioural change to reduce emissions;The development of case studies, hosting of competitions and associated prizes, training seminars and provision of support to organizations to promote usage of the carbon management tool;Sponsorship of third party initiatives to promote the climate change messages in a cost-effective manner as well as linkage with other Government and non-Government bodies to promote initiatives, for example, in the areas of cycling, energy efficiency, hosting of conferences and workshops at community level;The development, in partnership with St. Patrick's Teacher training college, of resources on climate change for teachers, which will be integrated into the school curriculum, as well as awareness campaigns and resources for transition year students and third level.My Department takes a rigorous approach in scrutinising proposed expenditure and activities with a view to ensuring best value for money is achieved.

The EPA report also acknowledges that there are a relatively large number of lead service connections which are the responsibility of the property owners.  The EPA has issued guidance to local authorities earlier this year in relation to conducting surveys to determine the extent of lead piping in the distribution network and the population served and to provide advice to property owners as to the risk involved.  These surveys will be carried out in consultation with the HSE.  A public water supply is put on the EPA's remedial action list where a risk has been identified which could potentially affect the provision of clean and wholesome drinking water from that supply.As the agency notes in its report, the remedial action list is not exhaustive and additional supplies will be added arising from the audits carried out the EPA and arising from information provided by water services authorities, from the HSE and from my Department.  Supplies are removed from the list when sufficient corrective action is taken by the relevant water services authority.  My Department will continue to work closely with the EPA and the relevant water services authorities to address schemes on the list, to ensure that the necessary works are carried out and that each supply provides clean and wholesome drinking water.  The remedial action list will be evaluated on a continuous basis.My Department and the EPA developed an action programme in response to a similar remedial action list identified in 2008.  In the case of some 60% of the supplies, the safety and security of supply could be addressed through abandonment of existing sources, better operational procedures or relatively small-scale improvements to the treatment processes.  I made available a fund of €16 million in 2008 to deal with these small scale improvements.  The balance of the supplies will require new or updated infrastructure and these are included in the Water Services Investment Programme.  My Department will be reviewing the additions to the list in 2009 with the EPA and relevant water services authorities to identify the appropriate solutions in these cases.Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations (No 2) 2007, extensive monitoring of drinking water supplies is carried out by local authorities to ensure compliance with microbiological and chemical parameters and in order to protect and safeguard public health.  The EPA report shows that almost 240,000 monitoring tests were carried out on water supplies by local authorities during 2007.  A water services authority is required to notify the HSE and the EPA where it considers there may be a potential risk to human health arising from a water supply.  Subject to agreement with the HSE, the local authority must then ensure that any supply of contaminated water is restricted or prohibited and that consumers are informed promptly and given appropriate advice.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	721	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 42, 66, 69 and 73 together.On 12 May 2009 I announced that the Government had decided to introduce a directly elected Mayor for the Dublin Region in 2010.  Work is now under way in my Department towards preparation of the necessary legislation to provide for the election and the powers and functions of the Mayor.  I hope to bring the legislation before the House during the autumn session.This legislation will ensure that the Mayor will have the authority and powers to deliver real leadership for the City and region and will provide him or her with a suite of substantial powers across the functions of local government.  The approach puts less emphasis on the unelected Manager and positions the Mayor firmly in the central leadership role for local government in Dublin.  This will be demonstrated through the role and powers of the Mayor.The Mayor will have responsibility for defining strategic policy in relation to land-use planning, waste management, water services, and housing across the four major Dublin local authorities.  In addition, the Mayor will also be chair of the Dublin Transport Authority leading the authority in delivering reliable, integrated and cost effective transport for the Greater Dublin Area.The Mayor will oversee implementation by the Dublin local authorities of the agreed regional strategies.  These authorities will be required to ensure that their actions are in compliance with the Mayor's regional plans and strategies, while each authority will retain its own role in adopting individual plans, strategies and budgets, and in the detail of implementation. The Mayor will also bring key public and private sector partners together to promote a dynamic and enterprising city region.  The integration of the activities of local government and the wider public service will be an important role for the Mayor, which will result in a better public service and improved services across the board.The approach does not remove powers from councillors but rather the creation of the office of directly elected Mayor brings a new dimension of representative local democracy to our system of local government.  This is in line with a principle which has been central to my approach to local government reform — that local democratic leaders have appropriate responsibility for making decisions at local level and clear accountability for those decisions.  The White Paper will further elaborate on this principle.My announcement of the Government decision on the Dublin Mayor marks the first phase of the transformation of local government in accordance with the Programme for Government.  It is my intention that the White Paper, which will address a broader suite of local government development and financing matters, will be informed by, and published following, Government consideration of the Report of the Commission on Taxation.

A welcome and positive outcome has been achieved in the first round of results for 2009, with 68% of the 60 towns and cities surveyed across the country achieving the highest grade possible, "Clean to European Norms".  This represents the best results achieved since the foundation of the League in 2002, when the percentage achieving the highest grade was just 14%.  The improvement is due, in no small part, to the excellent work being carried out by local authorities, in conjunction with local business and community groups, right across the country.Under statute, the primary response to litter is a matter for local authorities.  My Department's role is to provide the legislative framework for combating litter pollution, and to motivate and energise anti-litter responses as necessary.  It is the responsibility of each local authority to enforce the litter laws and to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution within the relevant legislation.People must also accept responsibility for their own behaviour which impacts on the environment, and it is regrettable that large volumes of litter were left on certain beaches over the June Bank Holiday weekend.  It is a matter for each local authority, within the framework of its own litter management plan, to determine the appropriate response to littering within its functional area.  While resources must be prioritised and effectively targeted within the overall economic constraints that apply to all public expenditure, I am satisfied that local authorities have adequate resources to address priority servicing needs and maintain key amenities for public and tourism use.

A top limit of €15,000 applied in the most populated areas, with limits of €13,000, €11,500 and €9,750 applying in less populated areas.  A spending limit of €7,500 applied in relation to elections to a borough or town council.The 2009 Act provides that the spending period is set by a separate ministerial order for a period between 50 and 60 days before polling day.  The spending period for the local elections held on 5 June 2009 commenced on 7 April, 2009 (a period of 60 days).Spending for electoral purposes incurred from 7 April to 5 June 2009 (inclusive) must be included on the statement of election expenses submitted to the relevant local authority by candidates, national agents, designated persons of political parties and third parties.  This form, which includes a signed statutory declaration, must be submitted within 90 days of polling day.  The deadline for submission of these statements in respect of the recent local elections accordingly, is 3 September 2009.This is the first time that spending limits have been in place for local elections.  If practical issues emerge with implementation of the new system, then I will, of course, consider them to determine any action that may be required.

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.  This funding increased significantly between 2005 and 2008, rising from €1.5 million to €4 million.  I am pleased that I will be in a position to maintain funding for this purpose in 2009 at the 2008 level of €4 million, bringing total funding allocations since 2004 to €15 million.In general, local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection activity in recent years with the number of inspections more than doubling — from 6,815 to 14,008 — in the period 2005 to 2007.  More detailed information on the number of inspections carried out each year up to and including 2007 is included in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  Work is under way on finalising the 2008 data which will be published later this summer; however, preliminary figures indicate a further year on year increase in activity of approximately 23%, with over 17,200 inspections completed in 2008.  This further significant increase reflects the positive impact of the overall Action Programme on Standards, including increased funding, introduced on foot of a commitment in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, and progress with the implementation of the rental accommodation scheme.

Both blanket bogs and raised bogs are protected habitats under European and Irish Law and representative samples have been designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the Habitats Directive or Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) under the Wildlife Acts.  Ireland has some of the most ecologically important bogs in the European Union.In 1999, when the first of these sites was designated for nature protection, all commercial turf cutting on these bogs was stopped and the then Minister granted a ten year grace period for those who were cutting turf for their personal domestic use to find alternative sources of fuel.Cutting on Blanket Bog SACs and NHAs can continue, except in very sensitive areas, under the current restrictions, which prohibit commercial extraction and the use of "sausage" machines.  However, the continued cutting of turf, by hand or machine, and associated drainage on designated raised bogs is incompatible with their preservation.Raised bogs occur predominantly in the midlands.  There are over 1,500 raised bogs in the State but only 139 of these are designated for nature protection as SACs or NHAs.  Even with the restrictions in cutting that were introduced in 1999, over one third of the active raised bog habitat on these sites has been lost in ten years.  It is clear that more needs to be done if Ireland is to meet it's obligation to protect this important habitat.Rather than a review of their designation, these sites now require more effective protection.  This involves a transition to end turf cutting on the small number of designated raised bogs.  I have established an interdepartmental working group to consider how best to achieve this transition and to assess the resources that will be required.  This group has invited submissions from interested parties and will consider these in arriving at its recommendations.The voluntary bog purchase scheme, which is operated by my Department, purchases plots on designated raised bogs.  The future operation of this scheme will be considered as part of the recommendations to be made by the working group.  In the meantime, the scheme will continue to operate as usual.

The planning system will support the achievement of this target through, for example:the introduction of a streamlined, single stage consent process under the 2006 Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act for certain classes of strategic infrastructure development including renewable energy installations such as large scale wind farms and hydroelectric energy production;the provision of policy guidance to planning authorities on wind energy development published in 2006;the introduction of exempted development regulations in 2007 and 2008 for certain renewable energy technologies in the residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors.A number of changes to the definition of infrastructure covered by the strategic infrastructure process will be brought forward on Committee Stage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, which was published on 3 June.  It is also my intention to modernise the consent process for strategic infrastructure development on the State Foreshore.In assessing an application for development, each planning authority and An Bord Pleanála is required to implement national law and EU directives concerning the protection of habitats and species.

Funding is provided for a variety of conservation projects including works to thatched houses, shop and public house fronts, timber sash windows, and to buildings of architectural significance generally, including town walls.  The recruitment of contractors to carry out the work is a matter in the first instance for the grant recipient.  My Department encourages each grant recipient to seek value for money while ensuring that the work is carried out under the supervision of a qualified expert, but has no direct role in the employment of contractors to carry out the conservation works.However, my Department provides funding to the Office of Public Works to undertake an apprenticeship programme for training in traditional building skills.  The apprenticeship positions are filled through a number of sources including through FÁS and in response to advertisements placed in the national media.

These schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department, together with 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  In the case of the old Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs grant schemes these are funded by 67% recoupment, together with a 33% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment and approval of individual applications, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.The annual allocations to local authorities under the schemes are calculated on foot of detailed discussion between my Department and the local authorities and on the basis of a number of criteria, including the level of applications on hand that have been assessed as eligible, applications yet to be assessed and projections for new applications to be received during the year.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the individual schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.Details of Exchequer funding provided to local authorities for these schemes for each of the years 2005 to 2008 and total allocations for 2009 from Exchequer and local authority sources are set out in the following table.  Data for 2005 and 2006 relate to the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants.  Data for 2007 onwards also include the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability, as well as the Mobility Aids Grant scheme.20052006200720082009€€€€€

It is up to individual housing authorities to plan their social housing investment programmes having regard to the specific social housing priorities in their areas and to the Exchequer funding allocations available to them.  €1.3 billion is being provided for the broad range of social housing programmes this year, with €760 million of this earmarked for the main local authority housing programme, including €20 million for long-term leasing arrangements.To ensure that the Social Housing Investment Programme is delivered in a coherent and co-ordinated manner housing authorities are required to prepare multi-annual Housing Action Plans, which encompass delivery of social and affordable housing in their areas.  Earlier in 2009 my Department held Housing Action Plan meetings with all housing authorities.  The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the direction and content of authorities' proposed housing investment programmes and particularly to consider the prioritisation of projects and the reconfiguration of the Social Housing Investment Programme as a whole, so that it can be sustained and consolidated in the changing economic and budgetary circumstances.  In this regard, particular emphasis continues to be placed on achieving best value for money while maintaining the programme flexibility necessary to respond to changing needs or circumstances, and utilising the full range of programme options in order to avail of supply opportunities that may arise in a housing market.Taking all the social housing programmes together, excluding those of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, and having regard to the capacity to access suitable housing available in the current housing market through the long-term leasing initiative, it is expected that in the region of 5,000 dwellings will be provided this year.The scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.  Subject to these factors, I am determined to ensure that the programme is framed in a manner which measures the capacity to meet housing needs, particularly in respect of the most vulnerable sections of society.

Accordingly, there are no plans to merge the NPSRA and the PRTB.  However, under the Government's agency rationalisation programme, the work of the Rent Tribunal is to be merged with that of the PRTB, and I will be giving formal effect to this at the earliest feasible legislative opportunity.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	737	I am committed to implementing the necessary measures to ensure that Ireland meets the EU landfill diversion targets by 16 July 2010.The National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April 2006 and sets out measures progressively to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill in accordance with the agreed targets in EU Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste.  These targets require progressive reductions in the amount of biodegradable municipal waste which was landfilled in the reference year of 1995.  They are designed to achieve a reduction to 75% by 2010, 50% by 2013 and 35% by 2016.  Action, on foot of any failure to meet these targets, would be a matter for the European Commission.Last year, my Department issued a circular to all local authorities to drive forward the roll out of brown bins for domestic householders and to promote the use of home composting.  My Department is also working with industry towards the development of a statutory instrument for the source segregation and appropriate treatment of catering waste and former foodstuffs from commercial premises.  It is envisaged that these regulations, when made, will have the potential to divert significant amounts of commercial food waste from landfill.  I have also signalled my intention to introduce primary legislation to allow for significant increases in the landfill levy to act as a further deterrent to landfill.In the light of the above, I am confident that all of the measures outlined will contribute significantly to the achievement of the targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from, and an overall reduction in our use of, landfill.

I am satisfied that appropriate powers and resources are available to these enforcement authorities.The 2005 report of the Office of Environmental Enforcement, The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland, identified the unauthorised collection and fly-tipping of waste as one of the problem areas in regard to waste management which needed to be further tackled.  The report drew attention to the measures already being taken, including the appointment of over one hundred additional enforcement officers across the local authorities funded by my Department, and the stepped up enforcement activity generally being led by the Office and the local authorities.  The report also identified additional actions which would further bolster the effort to stamp out this socially and environmentally unacceptable practice.My Department continues to liaise with the Office of Environmental Enforcement and other enforcement authorities in ensuring that the momentum to tackle such activities is maintained.  Following the issuing, in July of 2008, of a Ministerial policy direction under section 60 of the Waste Management Act all local authorities now have enforcement policies in place and actions to deal with this type of illegal activity are included in these plans for 2009.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	740	In general, following consideration by the Board of the Housing Finance Agency (HFA), the rates charged to local authority borrowers are normally adjusted in line with movements in European Central Bank (ECB) rates. However, given that the correlation between ECB rates and interbank rates (i.e. the rates at which the Agency itself borrows) is atypical and volatile at present,  the Agency, in responding to movements in ECB rates, must give careful consideration, on each occasion, to the fluctuating relationship between its lending rates and the cost of funds.While with other recent rate changes, interbank rates have eventually mirrored ECB movements allowing the Agency to pass on rate cuts while continuing to operate on a break-even basis, in the case of the most recent ECB rate cut of 0.25%, the required fall in the interbank rate has not materialised.  This means that the Agency's cost of funds has not fallen sufficiently to allow the most recent ECB cut to be passed on to borrowers.However, it should be noted in the meantime that local authority borrowers have benefited from a cumulative rate decrease since October 2008 of 3% and that rates charged to local authority borrowers offer exceptional value by comparison to rates charged by commercial lenders, with the local authority rate currently running at over 0.85% lower than the market average variable rate. Historically, this differential has been narrower, with the rate charged to local authority borrowers more typically running at around 0.5% lower than the market average.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	741	Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste sets challenging targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.  These are set out in the reply to a question on today's Order Paper, and are projected to equate to 59% for 2010, 73% by 2013 and 80% by 2016 for this particular waste stream.According to the recent National Waste Report 2007 published earlier in 2009 by the Environmental Protection Agency, over 2.3 million tonnes of biodegradable municipal waste was generated in 2007 of which approximately 840,000 tonnes (36%) were recovered.The Programme for Government includes a commitment to the implementation of the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste and the achievement of Ireland's obligations under the EU Landfill Directive. In this regard, I believe there should be less reliance on landfill and incineration and greater use of alternative technologies, including those for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste.The Programme for Government also provides for a major international review of waste plans, practices and procedures.  This review is now well advanced and examines the potential contribution that mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) and other technologies can deliver towards our landfill diversion targets, particularly in the context of recovering the biodegradable fraction in residual waste arising from domestic households.  I have already placed on the record my position that an over reliance on incineration is not the answer for residual waste treatment and my commitment towards the achievement of our landfill diversion targets.

Accommodation of children in family contexts is provided for through a range of housing supports operated by local authorities.  I am not aware of significant issues arising for local authorities in connection with children taken into care.  However, in the event of issues in this regard being raised with my Department by the Department of Health and Children, I will ensure that such matters are fully considered.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	743	Accepting an offer of accommodation in the voluntary sector is the same as accepting an offer of local authority accommodation, it is seen as having met the housing need of that household.  It is unreasonable to expect that where a household has agreed that its housing needs can be met adequately in the voluntary sector the household would remain on a local authority waiting list on the basis of some possible future requirement for alternative accommodation.When a household is assessed for local authority housing it is general practice for the housing authority to ask whether the household would be willing to accept an offer of accommodation in the voluntary sector should it become available.  It is the choice of the household as to whether the offer of voluntary accommodation is accepted.Notwithstanding this, should the housing needs of the household change in the future such that their existing accommodation (voluntary or otherwise) is no longer suitable for them, the household can at that stage apply to the local authority for housing more appropriate to their new needs.I have, in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 currently before the Dáil, provided for a broadening of the definition of social housing support to encompass not only local authority accommodation, but also voluntary/co-operative accommodation and accommodation in the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).  In tandem with this, new procedures for the allocation of social housing support will make it easier for social housing tenants (including tenants of the voluntary sector) to transfer between the different social housing support options where required.

As indicated in the reply to Question No. 577 on 22 April 2009, local authorities were requested to provide data in relation to their affordable housing stock for input to an online information system managed by the Affordable Homes Partnership, which will facilitate the collection of more detailed information on affordable housing stock.  The compilation of this information, which will provide a breakdown of the number of unsold affordable units in each area, is well advanced and should be completed shortly.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	745	The Programme for Government contains a range of commitments in respect of waste management policy centred on the Government's continued support for the internationally recognised waste hierarchy which places major emphasis on the prevention, reuse and recycling of waste while minimising reliance on landfill and incineration.  This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive to divert waste from landfill.  Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.  The Programme also signalled a move away from mass burn incineration towards alternative technologies.This is a process which will be assisted by the major international review of waste plans, practices and procedures, also provided for in the Programme, which will address how better to implement waste prevention and minimisation in the context of the emergence of new technologies for waste management, particularly those for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste which can reduce the need for both incineration and landfill.Undue emphasis on incineration as the cornerstone of waste management policy is detrimental to the development of alternative solutions.  The review may well indicate a continuing role for incineration in our future waste management strategy but I do not envisage it being on anything like the scale that was previously envisaged.  On completion of this major review I will bring forward any necessary legislative and policy initiatives needed to give effect to its conclusions.At present there are no municipal waste incinerators in Ireland and my Department has no function in determining the number, type, location or capacity of any such facilities that may be constructed.Waste management infrastructural projects are advanced by private sector service providers or by local authorities, generally by way of a public private partnership.  It is a matter for the promoters of such projects to seek and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals i.e. planning permission and a waste licence. In carrying out their functions planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, and the EPA in regard to waste licensing, act independently of the Minister.  The approved capacity of individual facilities is a matter for determination through these processes, as provided for in the Planning and Development and Waste Management Acts.

As part of this process local authorities are required to submit a valuation confirming the current market rent for the proposed lease properties and a statement confirming the discount below market value that is being achieved.In relation to the issue of break clauses, in most cases there will be no such provisions allowable within the lease.  However, in particular circumstances, where authorities propose to include such clauses within a lease agreement, my Department will assess these on a case by case basis having regard, for example, to the likely on-going housing demand within the area concerned.Households accommodated under the leasing arrangements will be deemed to have had their housing need met and therefore households will not remain on the local authority housing waiting lists.  Notwithstanding this, households will be able to apply to transfer to alternative local authority property or to housing provided under the Incremental Purchase Scheme.  I have, in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 currently before the Dáil, provided for a broadening of the definition of social housing support to encompass not only local authority owned or leased accommodation, but also voluntary/co-operative accommodation, and accommodation in the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).In tandem with this, new procedures for the allocation of social housing support will make it easier for social housing tenants, including tenants of leased accommodation, to transfer between the different social housing support options.  Tenants of leased properties who subsequently transfer to local authority housing and who wish to avail of current tenant purchase arrangements will have their period in leased accommodation taken into account towards the tenant purchase discount.

Initially, two sites will be dealt with involving some 14,000 tons of waste and estimated costs of some €3 million.  It is not possible to estimate the costs for remaining sites until they have been examined and it will take several years to complete the repatriation.Under the agreement the costs of disposing of the waste will be met by the Irish Government together with 80% of the costs of removing the waste from Northern Ireland.  The framework itself derives from a road map agreed by both jurisdictions in relation to co-operation in dealing with illegal waste movements, both current and historical, which was endorsed by Ministers from both jurisdictions in October 2007 and by the European Commission.My Department and the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland are maintaining close contacts to ensure that the relevant competent authorities in both jurisdictions are fully supported in the discharge of their statutory functions.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.In working to compile the Register for 2007/08, local authorities undertook and completed, with assistance from my Department, the most extensive registration campaign in decades.  On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared to previous years.  The task for local authorities, in relation to the Register for 2009/10, was to maintain and build on the progress made to date.Authorities were required to publish the Final Register for 2009/10 by 1 February 2009.  Individuals not on the Register can avail of the supplement to the Register up until 15 days before the next polling day. Returns received from registration authorities by my Department indicate that over 72,000 persons were included on the supplement to the Register before the recent elections.Looking to the future, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission.  The Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.  My Department appointed consultants to carry out preliminary research on issues arising in relation to establishment of the Electoral Commission.  I published the relevant report for consultation on 10 February 2009, with a closing date of 26 June 2009.

The Central Statistics Office, however, collects data on the number of people with a disability and the types of accommodation in which people with disabilities live, including local authority housing. The 2006 census shows that 12% of people with disabilities are renting accommodation from a local authority.In addition to this, the tri-annual housing needs assessment, which is undertaken by local authorities, seeks to identify the number of people with a disability who require housing within a local authority area and the household's specific accommodation requirements. This information is used to assist the authority in its plan for addressing housing need within their functional area.The national housing strategy for people with a disability is being progressed by my Department, with assistance from a National Advisory Group under the aegis of the Housing Forum, which involves a range of relevant stakeholders including the National Disability Authority. It is intended that this strategy will be finalised by the end of 2009, and as part of this process my Department will consider further the collection of data in relation to the housing of persons with disabilities.

Some 3,185 Irish schools are registered for the programme and over 1,757 schools have earned the right to fly the Green Flag.In Ireland, the scheme is administered by An Taisce and the environment elements are sponsored by a number of contributors including Repak, ESB Independent Energy and the Wrigley company as well as my own Department. The table below sets out the funding available from my Department for the Green Schools Programme over the period in question.  Funding otherwise made available is a matter for the individual sponsors involved.An Taisce has indicated very positive achievements in the current school year:12 tonnes per day of waste is directly diverted from landfill;3.7 million units of electricity has been saved;21 million litres of clean drinking water has been saved;600,000 litres of fuel has been saved on school travel.Year€2006150,0002007200,0002008200,0002009200,000

The IEN is an umbrella organisation which represents some 28 organisations whose primary objectives and activities are environmental protection and/or environmental sustainability.As is the case with any organisation in Social Partnership, the IEN has formally endorsed Towards 2016 and all the measures it contains.The process of incorporating the Environmental Pillar in the appropriate and relevant social partnership structures is ongoing in consultation with the Pillar and Departments.

Subject to this, the following is the position in so far as my Department is concerned.In accordance with the terms of the moratorium introduced earlier this year, no public sector post may be filled by recruitment except with the approval of the Minister for Finance. Where such recruitment has been approved, it is undertaken by the Public Appointments Service (formerly the Civil Service Commission) through competitions advertised in the public press.  People who apply expressing an interest in working in my Department are advised to register on the Public Appointments Service website at www.publicjobs.ie.Staff at Service Officer and Service Attendant level in my Department are recruited by way of competitive interview from our current complement of Cleaning staff.  With regard to the recruitment of Cleaners, my Department engages FÁS to recruit on its behalf.Ministerial private office appointments are made to a number of positions, i.e. Personal Assistant, Personal Secretary, Special Adviser and Civilian Driver.  These appointments require the sanction of both the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach. In this regard, instructions relating to the appointment of Ministerial private office staff issued by the Department of Finance are adhered to by my Department in addition to the requirements laid down in the Ethics in Public Office legislation.The recruitment of staff by the State bodies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter for the bodies concerned.  While I retain responsibility for policy issues, I am not responsible and have no involvement in the day-to-day operational activities of these bodies, which are statutorily independent.I can offer no comment or offer any response in respect of the example quoted by the Deputy, as I would have no function in the matter.

A total of €50m has been included in the estimate of my Department for this purpose in 2009.  Under the scheme, Enterprise Ireland can give up to €500,000 to viable companies with robust business models that are facing difficulties as a result of the current economic environment.  The fund will supply direct financial support to internationally trading enterprises that are investing in cost reduction or other measures to gain sales in overseas markets.  This fund will also be a key factor in sustaining client company employment.The provision of grant assistance to individual companies is a matter for the development agency or body concerned, and not one in which I have a direct function.  Enterprise Ireland has not released the individual company names and amounts approved as this is commercially sensitive information.However, I have been informed by Enterprise Ireland that to date approximately €6m has been approved for 16 projects, €20m is under active negotiation with another 30 companies and over 100 further enquiries have been received.  In summary, Enterprise Ireland has committed €6m and is negotiating the commitment of a further €20m leaving a balance of €24m in the Fund in 2009.

At the outset, the Deputies should note that in my role as the Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  The day to day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Financial Regulator which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions.I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputies.  The Financial Regulator has informed me that it cannot compel insurers to quote for business.  The decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved.  Therefore the Regulator has informed me that there is no basis for a review of a company's licence for a failure to quote.The Financial Regulator has also indicated that it has no role in relation to issues of pricing or the scope of cover provided by insurance companies.  In addition, the Consumer Protection Code does not address the issue of the non-provision of insurance services based on an insurer's commercial assessment.There are, however, some options open to persons who find themselves in this position.  Firstly, they can contact the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF) which administers a Declined Cases Agreement.  This is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland.  Under the agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance, if he/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  Details of this scheme can be found on the IIF website.  The second option open to consumers in such circumstances is to refer any unresolved complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman for investigation and adjudication.

Seizure ordinarily takes place wherever illicit cigarettes are detected, which can be at the point of importation, for example ports, airports and postal depots, or inland where the product is stored, distributed or sold.  This includes illegal selling at both markets and retail outlets.In the case of street or market traders engaged in selling counterfeit or contraband cigarettes, enforcement action is carried out both by Revenue Officers and the Garda under tobacco tax stamp legislation.To date in 2009, over 40m cigarettes with a retail value of approximately €16.7m have been seized. In addition, 72 convictions for smuggling and illegal selling have been obtained; those convictions include custodial sentences being imposed in 11 cases of which 7 were suspended.  Proceedings have been instituted in a further 120 cases.As regards the ban on the sale of cigarettes to minors as such, this is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children and is enforced at retail outlets by Environmental Health Officers.

Generally the arrest will be effected by an officer of the Revenue Customs Service acting as agent and on the direction of the Admiralty Marshal of the High Court.  Once an order is made for such arrest the vessel will remain under arrest until such time as it is released by Court Order.The arrest of vessels and cargo, and responsibility therefore while under arrest, is covered under separate pieces of legislation:(i) Merchant Shipping Act 1854;(ii) The Court of Admiralty (Ireland) Act 1867 (the 1867 Act);(iii) The Court of Admiralty (Amendment) Act 1876;(iv) The 1952 Arrest Convention ("1952 convention") which was given the force of law in Ireland by the passing of the Jurisdictions of the Courts (Maritime Conventions) Act 1989;(v) S.I. 143 of 1990. The responsibilities of the ship's owner are determined by the foregoing legislation and the Court and are not a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

A general rate of €10 per passenger would apply, with a lower rate of €2 for shorter journeys.The Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 confirms the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009.  However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 will apply to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300 km or less from Dublin airport.  This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow will be subject to the €2 rate.Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel.  Other countries within the EU apply similar taxes such as the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand.  The proposed rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.It should be recognised that tourists will only be subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should not have much effect on tourist numbers.  I appreciate the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity and the spike in oil prices in 2008.  Oil prices, despite increasing recently, have halved from the all-time high prices experienced last year.It should be noted that at present the decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result aviation services are contracting on a global basis. Indeed the decline in the number of people travelling is also evident in those countries where there is no air travel tax in place.We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure.  I tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it is a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.  I have no plans to review the air travel tax.

The mortgage lender must repay the money at this agreed rate, so there is a cost to the institution if the fixed rate agreement is terminated before the agreed term which gives rise to the redemption fee charged in these cases.On 26 March 2009, I undertook, in this House, to raise concerns regarding the level of redemption fees with the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator who has a statutory mandate to safeguard the interests of consumers.  At the beginning of April my Department wrote to the Consumer Director to request confirmation that redemption fees charged for switching from a fixed rate mortgage cover funding costs only and that there are no other costs included.To date, the Financial Regulator has been able to confirm to my Department that all mortgage lenders have responded and provided the formula they use when they calculate the early redemption fee that applies to fixed rate mortgages.  The Financial Regulator is awaiting independent verification by an actuary that the fee charged by a number of lenders recoups only the costs incurred by the lenders when they finance the fixed rate mortgage.  However, the verifications received show that the formulae applied by the relevant lenders seek to recoup the loss to them arising from the early redemption of the fixed rate mortgage and do not seek to apply a penalty charge to the borrower.The Financial Regulator is also examining whether any other costs are being charged such as administrative fees.  Any such charges may be subject to approval by the Financial Regulator under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and will be examined further in that light.  To date, the responses indicate that most lenders do not levy additional charges in the case of early redemption of fixed rate mortgages.The Financial Regulator has advised that further analysis may be necessary once all of the information is received and reviewed.  Should the remaining analysis by the Financial Regulator indicate that further consideration of this issue is required, it will be carried out.

It is facilitated by the use of the standard suitability assessment questionnaire developed by the public sector and accepted by the Construction Industry Federation. Getting on a tender list requires a contractor to demonstrate the capacity to reach the minimum thresholds set at particular levels for a number of criteria in the suitability questionnaire. There is no simple pass-or-fail criterion.The procuring authority is responsible for setting minimum thresholds as it is best placed to decide what is appropriate in a particular situation. As minimum thresholds can vary from project to project depending on its size, nature and complexity, they are not susceptible to standardisation.  However, the overriding principles that all contracting authorities must observe when setting minimum thresholds are those set out in the EC Treaty of non-discrimination, proportionality, fairness and transparency.  Contracting authorities are aware of these obligations and required to observe them when preparing tender lists.I recognise the importance of public contracts as a source of business for SMEs and I am anxious to promote their participation to the greatest extent possible under EU law. It is inevitable, given the present conditions in the construction sector, that there will be greater competition for places on tender lists and in tender contests. However, the Government Contracts Committee for Construction is currently undertaking a  review of guidelines Government Departments have published in relation to setting minimum standards. I will place this information on my Department’s website in due course.

The balance (approx. 650) of the Proposed Valuation Certificates will issue in September 2009 and the new Valuation List for Fingal County Council area will be published on 31st December 2009.The process of Revaluation for Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council area is underway and the Proposed Valuation Certificates will issue in June 2010 with the final list being published on 31st December 2010.The consultative process for the commencement of the Revaluation of Dublin City Council is in train. The estimated timeframe for completion of a nationwide revaluation is 10 years.In terms of Revaluation, any business which has its valuation for rating purposes lowered relative to that of other rateable properties may experience a reduction in rates liability.  However any such reduction will depend on the ARV (Annual Rate on Valuation — formerly Rate in the Pound) which falls to be determined by the relevant Local Authority.

However, persons who are in receipt of a pension as a consequence of having been office holders (e.g. civil servants) will be liable to income levy on that pension, even if resident in a country with which Ireland has negotiated a Double Taxation Agreement as that pension income continues to be taxable in Ireland under such agreements.If the person is resident in a country with which Ireland has not negotiated a Double Taxation Agreement, the person will be liable to income levy and indeed income tax on the pension.

Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, which was introduced in 1999, no individual or family unit pays more than €100 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioner services. In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP. In June 2006, I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards. For medical card and GP visit card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income. Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing the eligibility criteria for medical cards with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible, taking into account financial and medical need.In relation to the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme there are also currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions covered by the scheme, which was introduced on a statutory basis in 1971.  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, which was introduced in 1999, no individual or family unit pays more than €100 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.The conditions that qualify under the LTI scheme are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.

Since writing, the person concerned has had a meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) and the Clinical Director of BreastCheck's Southern Region. The person wrote to me again on 17 June to confirm that she has been reassured with regard to the reading of X-rays by BreastCheck radiologists at the Southern Screening Unit, located in Cork.Symptomatic breast services at Kerry General Hospital are not transferring to BreastCheck and the person concerned confirmed her understanding of this situation at her meeting with the NCSS. Symptomatic breast services at the hospital have been transferred, under the National Cancer Control Programme, to Cork University Hospital.  Follow-up mammography for symptomatic women will take place at Kerry General Hospital.BreastCheck began screening women aged 50-64 years in County Kerry in April this year from a mobile unit using digital mammography. The person concerned has raised questions regarding the effectiveness of digital mammography. There is significant evidence that digital mammography is at least as effective as the modality which it replaces.  Experience in BreastCheck to date indicates that the numbers of breast cancers being detected has increased as a result of the availability of digital mammography.  All replacement mammography equipment in screening programmes worldwide is now in the digital modality.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	782	Since it was established in 1998, the Government has allocated approximately €168m under the Young Peoples Facilities & Services Fund (YPFSF) to assist in the development of youth facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. Approximately €66m has been provided for capital developments, which include the building, upgrading, fit-out and refurbishment of some 220 youth and community facilities in the different target areas.  In 2009 just under €20m in capital and current funding has been provided to support the valuable work being done through the Fund.The Base Youth Centre has received YPFSF funding and has to date been allocated capital funding of €963,000 (€60,000 of which was in respect of fit-out) towards the youth element of the facility.   The Centre is also in receipt of current annual funding which in 2009 will amount to €497,300 and is towards the staffing and running costs of the Youth element of the centre. This current funding has not been subjected to any reduction on the 2008 allocation.As the Deputy is aware the economic landscape has changed dramatically and in the light of  fiscal restraints now faced by Government all funding streams will have to be examined later this year to ensure compliance with the Governments desire to adjust spending commitments.  All Development Groups, including Ballyfermot Development Group, will be kept informed in relation to funding.

As a result, with the exception of a limited number of projects, it was necessary to inform all NCIP capital grant applicants, including the applicant referred to by the Deputy, that the programme was closed to additional applications.  Existing capital commitments will continue to be processed during 2009 and 2010.The City and County Childcare Committees will be advised by my Office if and when additional capital funding becomes available to my Office in 2011 and 2012.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	786	While there is no scheme known as the Medical Hardship Fund, the granting of a medical card is based on the avoidance of undue hardship on the part of cardholders in meeting their medical needs. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations. Medical card holders are exempted from payment of in patient charges and their prescribed drugs and medicines are provided free of charge.In addition, people in the following categories are exempt from payment of in-patient charges:women receiving services in respect of motherhood;children up to the age of six weeks;children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school health examinations;children suffering from diseases or disabilities prescribed under section 52 (2) of the Health Act 1970;persons receiving services for the diagnosis or treatment of infectious diseases prescribed under the Health Act, 1947;long-stay patients who are already subject to a charge; andholders of a Health (Amendment) Act CardFurthermore, under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), which was introduced in 1999, no individual or family unit pays more than €100 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	787	The information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected by my Department. I would point out however, that  the number of persons applying for a medical card has increased greatly in recent months due to the downturn in the economy and the associated rise in the live register.  In the first five months of 2009 there was a net increase of 46,566 medical card holders and 4,491 GP visit card holders. There are now over 1.39 million persons with a medical card and over 90,000 persons with a GP visit card.Up to the start of this year, medical card and GP visit card applications were processed in the 32 local health areas. However, under the Health Service Executive's 2009 Service Plan, the processing of medical card and GP visit card applications will be centralised in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin. The change is being implemented on a phased basis and has commenced with the PCRS processing all applications for persons aged 70 and over.Under the new arrangements, the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all applications. Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours.The HSE has the operational responsibility for the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. Accordingly, my Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Unit of the Executive to address the issues raised, and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	788	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 to 118, inclusive, together.The Public Capital Programme in October's Budget 2009 included €425.45m for the building, equipping and furnishing of health facilities.  Following the Supplementary Budget in April, the capital allocation available for 2009 now stands at €370.724m.The Health Service Executive is currently revising its Capital Plan to take account of the revised capital allocation following the Supplementary Budget. Information on the extent and timing of commitments already entered into is being updated as part of this review process.  It is clear at this stage that expenditure in 2009 will need to be managed carefully within the available limits and further commitments will require prioritisation within the likely funding envelope in future years.  In determining its capital programme, the Health Service Executive is required to prioritise the capital infrastructure projects to be progressed within its overall capital funding allocation, taking account of the targets for apportionment of capital investment between the Acute and Primary, Community & Continuing Care programmes and the contractual commitments in place from earlier years.When completed, the Executive's revised Capital Plan 2009 — 2013 must be submitted for my approval with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  Details of the individual projects being included in the Capital Plan will be made available when the plan is approved.

These included pre-school service providers who are notified to the Health Service Executive (HSE) or registered with the Irish Montessori Education Board (IMEB) and a number of other persons who have expressed an interest in establishing a pre-school service and participating in the scheme.  Application forms and other relevant information regarding the scheme were included in this correspondence and applicants are now returning forms to their local City or County Childcare Committees.  The closing date for response is 10 July 2009.  I have asked officials in the Childcare Directorate in my Office to forward a copy of the correspondence in question to the Deputy.I understand that a list of participating services in each area will be made available to each City and County Childcare Committee by the end of September 2009 and parents of qualifying children will be able to contact their local Committee from that point to obtain details of local services entering the scheme.  Parents will then be in a position to enrol children in local services.  In many cases, parents will already have plans in place to enrol their children in services which are in the process of applying for the scheme or may already have children attending a service which proposes to participate.

The application has, therefore, been finalised and I am now in a position to inform you of the details of the application.The applicant originally sought approval for an hourly service between Dalkey and Dublin Airport with stops at Dalkey, Glasthule, Dun Laoghaire, Monkstown, Blackrock and Ailesbury Road.The applicant later amended the application to include an additional stop at the Killiney Castle Hotel.  Approval was given for all requested stops bar Glasthule, Blackrock and Ailesbury Road.The Blackrock and Ailesbury Road stops were refused as these stops and the timings would give rise to competition with an existing licensed operator providing an express Dublin Airport service.  It is the Department's policy to avoid creating head-to-head competition between operators particularly where there are similar departure times.Consideration of the request for the Glasthule stop was deferred until consideration of a prior application for a service on this route was completed.  The next step is to consider an application from another operator.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	798	It is compulsory under the Road Traffic Acts to have motor insurance to use a motor vehicle in a public place.  A motor insurance policy is a private contract between the motor insurer and the driver.  Insurers assess risk and charge premiums based on that risk assessment. Motor insurance companies in Ireland insure vehicle drivers rather than vehicles. This enables them to calculate the risks associated with a specific driver and thereby price the insurance premium accordingly. The factors taken into account when calculating the risk include the age, gender and driving experience of the driver, the engine size of the vehicle and its usage together with the address at which the vehicle is based.   On occasions insurers may decide that they do not wish to cover the risk.Because motor insurance is compulsory, The Government has an agreement with the motor insurance industry called the Declined Cases Agreement.  By virtue of this agreement, where a qualified driver cannot secure motor insurance or in instances where the premium is so high as to be tantamount to a refusal to quote, the Declined Cases Committee operated by the Irish Insurance Federation will seek to find a motor insurer.

In relation to the necessary legislation, the Deputy may be aware that the Aviation (Preclearance) Bill 2009 was passed by Seanad Eireann on the 16th of this month and I hope to introduce it in Dáil Éireann next week to enable it to be enacted before the Summer recess.My officials are working closely with the US authorities on the final aspects of the operating procedures between the two administrations to ensure that preclearance will work to the benefit of both countries.  My objective is that these collaborative efforts with the U.S. will allow preclearance to be inaugurated in Shannon before the end of July.Preclearance is a significant development for Irish Aviation.  As well as improving the passenger experience for those travelling to the U.S., preclearance should, over time, contribute significantly to the growth of new business for Irish Airports as airlines take advantage of unique opportunities arising from access to a wider range of airports in the U.S.

Due to the volume of court escorts which took place over the periods in question, it would not be possible to calculate the costs requested without an inordinate amount of manual checking of records by the Irish Prison Service.  The costs attributed to all escorts undertaken by the Prison Service Escort Corps for 2007 and 2008 are €14.6 million and €14.4 million, respectively.  These costs include the costs associated with the transfer of prisoners specifically for the purposes of court appearances.  Certain other non-pay escort-related costs are charged to individual prisons and these costs are not included in the above.

The PRA replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.The Deputy will be aware of the service to T.D.s and Senators which provides information on the current status of applications, such as the subject of this question, which was introduced in May 2006.  The service provides a speedier, more efficient and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  It is operated by the PRA and is available all year round.I can further inform the Deputy that his query has been forwarded to the PRA for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.

The Remembrance Commission, which was established on foot of the report of the Victims' Commission, A Place and a Name, disbursed funding in accordance with the Scheme of Acknowledgement, Remembrance and Assistance for Victims in this Jurisdiction of the Conflict in Northern Ireland.  Under the Scheme, an amount of money was made available to victim support groups for the purpose of meeting the counselling needs of victims or members of the surviving families of victims in this jurisdiction as a result of the conflict.  The group in question was the only recipient of money under this heading, receiving a total of almost €1.2m from the Commission.The term of appointment of the Remembrance Commission, which was originally three years, was extended by a further year on two occasions.  The term of appointment came to an end on 31 October 2008.  Subsequently, I took a decision to grant an amount of further funding to the group in respect of the second half of its financial year, which ends on 31 July 2009.  I have since made an additional amount of money available to the group out of the monies available to my Department for 2009.  The funding awarded to the group following the end of the Remembrance Commission's term of appointment totals €190,300.  I understand that this funding will be sufficient to allow the group to continue to operate well into next year.Officials of my Department met recently with representatives of the group in question to inform them that, as the financial allocation to my Department in respect of the Remembrance Commission no longer exists, no further funding of this kind could be made available to the group.  The group has been advised to explore other avenues of funding which may be open to it.  My first priority, as I have previously stated to the House, is to ensure that the long-term medical expenses of survivors of incidents in this jurisdiction arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland will continue to be provided for and I can confirm that this will be the case.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	807	The Government Alcohol Advisory Group submitted its Report containing recommendations for reforms in statutory provisions on the public order aspects of the sale and consumption of alcohol in March 2008. Its key recommendations, including the recommendation that off-sales of alcohol be permitted only between the hours of 10.30 a.m. and 10.00 p.m., were subsequently accepted by the Government and were given statutory effect in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.Section 4 of the 2008 Act contains the new provisions restricting the off-sales of alcohol and it has received broad public support as part of the Government's overall strategy to address the significant public disorder and hugely damaging public health aspects of excessive alcohol consumption and binge drinking. I have no plans therefore to extend the periods during which of-sales of alcohol are permitted.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	808	Most public order offences involving alcohol related disorder are prosecuted under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  Sections 4 and 5 of that Act are of particular relevance to alcohol related offences. They relate to offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place, respectively.The Deputy will be aware that, as part of a general review of the fines for public order offences, the fines for offences under sections 4 and 5 were increased last year by an amendment to the 1994 Act in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  The maximum fine for persons convicted of an offence under section 4 is now €500 and the maximum fine for a conviction under section 5 is now €1000.I would also draw the Deputy's attention to Section 8 of the 1994 Act.  That section provides for a Garda to direct a person to desist from behaving in a manner contrary to the provisions of section 4 and 5.  The Garda may instruct the person to leave the vicinity of the area in question.  Failure to comply with the direction is an offence punishable by a fine or up to six months imprisonment, or both.  The maximum fine was increased to €1000 by the 2008 Act.   The 2008 Act presented an opportunity to further enhance Garda powers to combat alcohol related disorder with the insertion of a new section 8A into the 1994 Act.  Section 8A provides that a Garda may confiscate intoxicating liquor from a person and may direct that person and any accompanying persons to leave the area in a peaceable manner.  A person convicted of an offence under this section is liable to a fine of up to €1000.The Deputy will be aware that section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides for exclusion orders, which may be imposed on persons convicted of specified offences under the 1994 Act, including offences under Sections 4 and 5.  Certain restrictions can be imposed by these orders regarding access to certain catering premises.I would also inform the Deputy that in September 2008, I introduced Regulations that provide for the issue of fixed charge notices for offences under sections 4 and 5 of the 1994 Act.  These Regulations permit a Garda to serve a fixed charge notice on a person who, in the opinion of the Garda, has committed one of these offences.  The notice provides for the option of paying a fixed charge of €140 in respect of disorderly conduct and €100 in respect of public intoxication, instead of being prosecuted for the relevant offence. These Regulations gave effect to sections 23A and 23B of the 1994 Act which were inserted by Section 184 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.Having introduced the measures mentioned above so recently, I have no plans at present for further changes in the level of penalties but I will be keeping the situation under review.

The person in question was written to and informed of this decision and was also invited to submit updated representations under section 3 of the Immigration Act,1999 as to why a Deportation Order should not be made in respect of him. This letter, which was sent by registered post to the most recent address which my Department had for the person concerned, was subsequently returned to my Department marked "not called for".I have arranged for officials within my Department to update the address of the person in question to that provided by the Deputy and re-issue the letter referred to. Any response to that letter, when received, will be assessed by the relevant officials and the person concerned will be notified of any decision made subsequently.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 9 March 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file is passed to me for decision.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	812	The Government remains seriously concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where there are more than 1.7 million internally displaced persons as a result of conflict.The Government's aid programme, operated by Irish Aid, does not have an annual budget for the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, because of the level of humanitarian need, our support in recent years for the people of the country has been substantial. All funding has been channelled through our established UN and Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) partners. It is allocated on the basis of need to the agencies which are best placed to be effective.In 2008, Ireland provided a total of almost €12.5 million in assistance to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Of this, some €8.5 million was allocated as emergency humanitarian aid through a range of established partners on the basis of need. These partners included the UN's Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC, Concern, Trócaire, Oxfam, Christian Blind Mission and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The balance of €4 million was allocated to NGO partners for development and human rights activities. This funding was provided through a range of established mechanisms including Irish Aid's Multi Annual Programme Scheme, the Civil Society Fund, the Block Grants Scheme and through Misean Cara. The organisations funded through these schemes included Concern, Goal, Trócaire, a number of Missionary organisations, the International Rescue Committee and the Carter Centre.The precise level of humanitarian funding in 2009 will depend to a great extent on developments in the humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. To date, €3,775,000 has been allocated, €3.5 million of which is being channelled through the UN's Common Humanitarian Fund, and €275,000 through the NGO, Médecins Sans Frontières. In addition, funding for development and human rights activities in 2009 is being channelled through the existing mechanisms for cooperation with our NGO partners. It is anticipated that it will be broadly in line with the pattern of funding in 2008.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	813	A grant of €100,000 was provisionally allocated to the project in question under the Sports Capital Programme in 2006.  The grant allocation is subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme, which include compliance with requirements relating to a deed of covenant and charge.A deed of covenant and charge provides, inter alia, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated.  The Department’s legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor’s Office — CSSO — deals with the grantee’s solicitor in relation to the deed.  Formal approval of an allocation under the Sports Capital Programme is not possible until the CSSO notifies my Department that all legal issues are completed.  This notification was received yesterday in the case of the allocation in question.The guidelines, terms and conditions for the programme specify that the Department will pay grants in stages as an approved project proceeds by reimbursing the applicant's costs when they submit original, paid, valid invoices or certificates of payment and upon receipt of appropriate tax clearance certification.  The Department typically pays 70% of the value of the valid paid invoices submitted.  In addition, the Department reserves 5% of the grant pending confirmation from a consultant or architect that the facility has been satisfactorily completed in all respects.  A letter issued to the club in question yesterday from the Department outlining the outstanding items required to be submitted in support of the payment of the grant, subject to the retention arrangements outlined above.

The approval and certification of projects under the Scheme is a matter for the Mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Board in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in consultation with the Minister for Finance.The Mid-Shannon Board and the executive teams within Fáilte Ireland and Shannon Development have extensively promoted the Scheme since its commencement date.  Information seminars have been held with industry groups throughout the targeted region and local authorities have also been engaged to ensure their support for the Scheme and projects that might result from it.I am advised that, to date, a total of nine applications have been submitted to Fáilte Ireland and Shannon Development for consideration under the Scheme.  These applications are currently being prepared for submission to the Mid-Shannon Board for evaluation.  The Board has not yet approved any project under the Scheme.The Finance Act 2009 made provision to extend the period during which such applications can be made from one year to two years so that the latest date for the submission of applications is now 31 May, 2010.  The eligible period within which expenditure must be incurred for capital allowances purposes has also been extended to 31 May, 2013.  These extensions of time are subject to the approval of the European Commission.

The work on the EIA will run for 12 months.  On completion of the survey and as the EIA is progressed, the options for the route of the restored section of canal will be reviewed.When a preferred option is identified, I am advised that it will be developed and submitted for planning approval.  Following receipt of planning permission, the land acquisition process will be finalised.  Subject to the foregoing processes and available resources, it is anticipated that the design and construct contract could be let with a view to construction commencing in 2011.

He was requested to furnish certain documentation within 7 days of this date in support of his application.  He was advised that failure to do so within the specified time would result in the closure of his claim.  He failed to furnish the required documentation within the specified time and his claim was subsequently closed.The person concerned made a further application for jobseeker's allowance on 13 February 2009.  He was awarded payment at the rate of €98.30 per week with means assessed at €106.00 per week.With regard to the persons participation on a Community Employment scheme, the age at which persons are accepted on CE schemes is a matter for FÁS.  The Department has arranged for the person concerned to be referred to FÁS on 8 July 2009 for interview under the Employment Action Plan (EAP).

This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively all of the time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the impairment or disease, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating a degree of extra care and attention required.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.As there were no agreed national medical guidelines for the scheme while it was administered in the Health Service Executive, an Expert Medical Group was established in advance of the transfer of functions to this Department.  This Group was chaired by this Department's Chief Medical Advisor and comprised of medical personnel from the HSE as well as some eminent professionals in the areas of physical disabilities which affect children and child psychology.  The primary purpose of this Group was to arrive at a consensus regarding the medical eligibility in order to qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance from the Department with a view to ensuring a consistency in the application of the scheme rules.  Every application is assessed by the Department Medical Assessors and an individual medical opinion, based on the information submitted by the applicant in support of their claim, is offered in each case.In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed by a different Medical Assessor specially designated for this task.Where a person is not satisfied with the decision of a Deciding Officer they may appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The living alone increase is an additional payment of €7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.  The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.The increase is not a payment in its own right but a supplement to an Irish social welfare payment.  As such, it cannot be paid to people without a social welfare entitlement or to those whose pension payments are made exclusively under the social security regimes of other countries.  There are no plans to change these criteria.In relation to those receiving payments exclusively from other countries, the needs of older people are often provided for in different ways by these countries. While the Irish system provides a basic pension, supplemented by allowances and other benefits, the approach adopted by other countries can be very different, with each country providing for the needs of older people in the way it sees fit.  The fact that a living alone increase is not paid by another administration merely reflects a different approach to providing for the needs of older people.It is, of course, open to recipients of pensions from other countries to apply for pensions under the Irish system and they can do this in a number of ways.  Those with a mixture of social insurance contributions from this country, other EU countries, or from countries with which Ireland has reciprocal agreements, may qualify for a pro-rata contributory pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a non-contributory pension if they can satisfy a means test.  Improvements made to the income disregard in recent years have made it easier for people to qualify for a pension and receive the additional support provided under our pension system for those who live alone.The national fuel scheme is a means-tested payment for householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments to assist with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid for 32 weeks from end-September to end-April.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  A pension/benefit or equivalent payment from any country governed by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement is considered a qualifying payment for the purpose of the national fuel scheme.  The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or only with a qualifying dependant.

Under these provisions, the Registrar General is charged with maintaining an Adopted Children Register and also to keep an index to make traceable the connexion between each entry and the corresponding entry in the register of births.  The index is not open to public inspection and no information from it may be given to any person except by order of a Court or of the Adoption Board.  A certified copy of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, if purporting to be issued under the seal of Oifig an Ard-Chlaraitheora, shall, without further proof, be received as evidence of the facts stated therein and any requirement of law for the production of a certificate of birth shall be satisfied by the production of such certified copy.Under the above provisions, birth certificates for adopted persons are available only from the Office of the Registrar General.  While it is appreciated that this may cause a degree of inconvenience in certain instances, the security and confidentiality of the Adopted Children Register is of paramount importance and it is for this reason only that the restriction on availability exists.  For this reason also, there are no plans to amend the legislation to change the current arrangements in relation to this matter.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The issue of potential health effects of mobile phone masts was comprehensively covered by the Expert Group Report published by Government in March 2007 entitled "Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields", which is available for download on the Department's website, www.environ.ie/en/publications.The Expert Group Report examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those produced by mobile phone base stations.  It answers many of the health risk questions raised by the public in relation to the potential effects of electromagnetic fields.  The report and its recommendations were accepted by the Government and form the basis for current policy in this area.The majority scientific opinion is that to date no adverse short or long term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).  However, a minority group of scientists believe otherwise and extensive international research continues to be coordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation.  This research is co-funded by the Irish Government.Over the last number of years the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) has conducted measurement surveys to verify compliance with ICNIRP limits by their licensees.  The detailed measurement results from over 600 mobile phone base station sites have been published on their website.  All measurements have so far shown total compliance with the ICNIRP limits with values that were typically hundreds of times below these limits.The Expert Group concluded that there is limited scientific evidence of adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields below ICNIRP limits.  The Report has, however, recommended that precautionary measures be used, where appropriate, and that Ireland continue to adopt and enforce the international guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection and endorsed by the World Health Organisation and the European Commission.  This recommendation has also been accepted by Government.I have asked my Department to keep me updated as to the findings of newly published research from peer reviewed scientific journals and to monitor developments in other EU Member States.My Department's current advice to those living in close proximity to mobile phone base stations, based on the conclusions of the Expert Group Report, is that there is no scientific basis or evidence of adverse health effects in children or adults as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields.  This applies irrespective of the location of the phone mast.

As a result of lower than anticipated motor tax receipts it has been necessary to reduce the General-Purpose Grant allocation to local authorities by some €30m.I have arranged today for publication of the Local Government (Charges) Bill 2009 and for its presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill gives effect to the Budgetary Decision in October 2008 to introduce a €200 charge on non principal residences.  I anticipate that it will be enacted as soon as possible so that local authorities can benefit from the estimated €40 million revenue stream to which it will give rise in the current year.  This will more than compensate the local government sector for the reduction in the General-Purpose Grant allocations.The Government decision to introduce public sector pension-related measures applies to all public sector employees, including those employed by local authorities.  The pension related deductions are being retained by local authorities and there will be a corresponding reduction in the Exchequer contribution to the Local Government Fund  resulting in a neutral impact on local authority finances.It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to locally identified needs. I am satisfied that the level of funding provided through both general purpose grants and the new revenue stream arising from the charge on non principal private residences makes a significant contribution towards enabling all local authorities to provide a reasonable level of services to the public.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.Authorities were required to publish the Final Register for 2009/10 by 1 February 2009. Individuals not on the Register can avail of the supplement to the Register up until 15 days before the next polling day. Returns received from registration authorities by my Department indicate that over 72,000 names were included on the supplement to the Register before the recent elections. I consider that the current arrangements relating to the inclusion of persons on the supplement to the Register strike a reasonable balance between having a flexible supplement facility and, at the same time, ensuring that there are adequate measures in place to counteract any possible abuse.Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Electoral Act 1992 provide that a person shall be entitled to be registered where he/she is ordinarily resident on the qualifying date. Rule 5(3)(a) of the Second Schedule to the 1992 Act provides that the registration authority may for the purposes of their duties in relation to the preparation of a register require a person to give any information in their possession which the registration authority may require.Looking to the future, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission. The Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.  My Department appointed consultants to carry out preliminary research on issues arising in relation to establishment of the Electoral Commission.  I published the relevant report for consultation on 10 February 2009, with a closing date of 26 June 2009.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	828	The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has, for many years now, worked towards assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country. Between 1992 and 1999 the RPII carried out a comprehensive National Radon Survey to measure radon concentrations in Irish homes. The principal objective was to identify the scale of the radon problem in Ireland and to identify areas at higher risk of radon contamination above the National Reference Level of 200 becquerels per metre cubed (Bq/m3).The Government's approach to radon, which is similar to that of the majority of EU member states, is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home. Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged by the RPII to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary. The RPII have carried out targeted information campaigns in high radon areas and in some instances where areas of particularly high radon levels have been found they have written directly to householders in these areas. This will continue to be the focus so as to enable and encourage householders to address monitoring and remedial requirements effectively and economically.Over 35,000 homes have now been measured for radon by the RPII. The results of these tests have been compiled into a central database, which has greatly aided our knowledge and understanding as to the extent of Ireland's radon problem. These results, broken down on a county basis, are included in the table below. In addition to the measurements undertaken by the RPII a number of private companies also offer radon measurement services.Since 1998 the Building Regulations require all new buildings to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction. In October 2004 an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) was published incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that radon protection measures are carried out more effectively.If a household is found to have high radon levels remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department called Radon in Buildings — Corrective Option. The RPII have also issued guidance entitled Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide. In addition, the RPII have a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and can offer specific advice and recommendations. These are available on the RPII website, www.rpii.ie.The Scheme of Housing Aid for Older People is available to assist older people, generally over 60 years, to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out to their homes. Where a suite of works is being grant aided under this scheme, local authorities may also, as part of the package of works, assist with the provision of radon remediation works, where applicable.My Department has already given approval to a number of local authorities to undertake, on a sample basis, radon surveys of their housing stock in high incidence areas. In addition the RPII have directly contacted local authorities with known areas of high radon concentration to encourage them to test local authority housing stock for radon, and where necessary, take remedial action.In May 2009 I announced a €20 million scheme for improving energy efficiency in local authority housing stock. The focus of this investment will be the retrofitting of insulation and improvement in energy efficiency measures of vacant social housing. The package of works covered by this scheme includes provision for installation of radon protection measures.Number of houses in categories of radon concentrationCountyNumber of houses measured% homes >200 Bq/m30-199 Bq/m3200-800Bq/m3>800Bq/m3Highest measured concentration (Bq/m3)%Carlow6771855611561,725Cavan3563344120780Clare3,072112,725291562,980Cork4,216113762422324,516Donegal1,0395991480512Dublin231162,16314711,410Galway4,530203,622817913,434Kerry2,981142,5633298949,000Kildare95559074531,114Kilkenny9071379310862,444Laois4834465180565Leitrim28762691711,630Limerick1,01889417431,857Longford2627243181876Louth53113460710751Mayo2,981162,498452316,203Meath6929631592932Monaghan2437227160794Offaly4073395120495Roscommon521104675221387Sligo1,360241,038275475,508Tipperary1,538111,372152142,394Waterford99522778186319,714Westmeath4909445450699Wexford1,257141,075168142926Wicklow1,551171,2872442016,438Total35,6601331,0174,193450

Details of all major water and sewerage schemes included for funding by my Department are set out in the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.   Additional information in relation to progress on individual contracts under this Programme, or in relation to activity generally under the small public schemes measure of the devolved Rural Water Programme, may be obtained from the relevant local authority.A provision of €500 million is available for the Programme for 2009, which is a 1% increase on the record outturn on the Programme for last year.   I expect that the available resources will allow up to 50 major new water and wastewater schemes to commence this year, some of which have already started. My Department will prioritise the remaining schemes yet to start, having regard to both environmental and economic objectives i.e. schemes required to meet National and EU environmental standards in relation to drinking water and wastewater disposal, European Court of Justice cases and works that will support economic development.My Department is also initiating a comprehensive review of the Water Services Investment Programme and will be working with local authorities over the coming months to identify the priority projects to form the basis of the next phase of the Programme.  The completion of the River Basin Management Planning process will also provide a key  input into this process.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	830	I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 163 together.Monitoring at permanent and mobile monitoring stations by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local authorities confirms that air quality in Ireland is good.  Air quality assessment is the responsibility of the EPA and air quality management a matter for local authorities informed by air quality measurement data.Air quality standards in Ireland are prescribed in an EU context and the principles agreed under the EU Air Quality Framework Directive in relation to monitoring, assessment and management of ambient air quality. This became Irish law through the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations 1999.   Under further regulations made in 2002, 2004 and 2009 specific ambient air quality standards have been prescribed for Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead  (2002); Carbon monoxide and benzene (2002); Ozone (2004); and Polyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury in ambient air (2009)Where the indicative level for any pollutant is exceeded, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 require the local authority concerned, following notification by the EPA, to develop a long-term air quality management plan to ensure compliance with the thresholds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants.The EPA reports the results of the air quality monitoring of the above pollutants through its website on a real time basis in the case of a number of monitoring stations and on a monthly basis in the case of ozone, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide.  The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being the report on Air Quality in Ireland 2007 which was published in September 2008. It contains details of the monitoring and assessment of national air quality, and incorporates data from all air quality monitoring stations.The report confirmed that air quality in Ireland is good and complied with the air quality standards in force for all pollutants including particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, black smoke, lead, ozone, carbon monoxide and benzene.  The EPA reports are available to the public at: http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/monitoring/air/data/.   My Department keeps this data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets regularly with the EPA on air quality issues.With regards to the monitoring of air pollution in County Kildare, the EPA carried out an air quality assessment in Naas in 2003 / 2004, the results of which are available on the EPA website.The role of local authorities in air quality monitoring has evolved in recent years from a time when they were responsible for black smoke and sulphur dioxide monitoring in compliance with earlier air quality standards.  Monitoring requirements changed as the number of pollutants in respect of which national standards were prescribed increased and the monitoring equipment became more sophisticated and automatic which allowed monitoring networks to be more targeted and efficient.Where local authorities choose to operate monitors they are facilitated by the EPA to become part of the national monitoring network. Local authorities were encouraged to continue with black smoke monitoring to maintain the valuable historical dataset.  The EPA stores this data and reports it in the annual report.  Nine local authorities continue to report black smoke in this way.  Some local authorities also monitor sulphur dioxide for local reasons using the manual method.As part of the Programme for Government commitment on monitoring air quality, my Department requested the EPA to undertake an overall review of the adequacy of the air quality monitoring network in light of population change in urban areas.   The EPA is expected to deliver this report shortly.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	832	Section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 empowers a planning authority to grant planning permission for development, subject to or without conditions, or to refuse it, having regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of the relevant area.  Conditions may include a requirement for the completion and maintenance of watermains and drains.  Where a planning application is made in respect of a prescribed development or class of development, the application must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement.  An EIS must contain, among other things, a description of the likely significant effects, direct and indirect, on the environment of the proposed development.  Where an EIS identifies significant adverse effects on the environment, it must also contain a description of the measures envisaged in order to avoid, reduce and, if possible, remedy those effects.Section 215 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the transfer to An Bord Pleanála of the functions of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government specified in sections 49 to 51 of the Roads Act 1993 with regard to the approval or otherwise of motorway and other specified roads schemes and developments.  The Board is empowered, under Section 217C(2) of the 2000 Act, to approve a relevant scheme or development or any part thereof, with or without conditions or modifications, or to refuse to approve the scheme or development or any part thereof.  In the case of a proposed motorway or a prescribed type of public road development, an EIS must be prepared and submitted to the Board.  Before approving a road scheme within the meaning of section 47 of the 1993 Act, the Board must hold an oral hearing of all matters relating to the scheme.As well as complying with the requirements of the planning code, applicants for planning permissions may be required to comply with a range of other legislation including the Water Pollution Acts 1977 and 1990.  My Department issued Development Management Guidelines in 2007, which state that the existence of a planning condition, or its omission, will not free a developer from his or her responsibilities under other legislative codes.  It advises that, where they consider it necessary to do so, planning authorities could, when notifying the grant of a planning permission, issue a clear notification about the requirements of other legislative codes.Specific guidance regarding drainage systems for housing developments is set out in my Department's publication Recommendations for Site Development Works for Housing Areas.

Appropriate capital works relating to the control of emissions are funded by my Department in the provision of new or upgraded infrastructure.Methane is an odourless gas, which in the case of wastewater infrastructure, is most usually associated with the routine production of methane as a by-product for treating wastewater sludge.

For these sites, the derogation given by the Government, which allowed the continuation of turf cutting for personal domestic use, expires in 2009.The person in question in this case owns land within Eskerboy Bog, a Natural Heritage Area designated in 2004 and the 10 year derogation period will not expire until 2014.  Land transactions within this area, accordingly, will not qualify for priority attention this year.

Within this framework, Returning Officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the conduct of elections and referenda, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station staff to take the poll on polling day in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	837	As Minister, my role is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.  Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area, including recreational facilities, public transport facilities and water facilities, including water and waste water treatment facilities, drains and watermains and any matters ancillary to these.Section 49 of the Act provides for the drawing up of a supplementary development contribution scheme in order to facilitate a particular public infrastructure service or project which is provided by a local authority.  The adoption of development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority and it is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and types of development to which they will apply.  An Bord Pleanála is required to consider the planning application, the subject of the appeal, de novo.  In view of this fact, the Board is permitted to attach conditions, including development levy conditions, to permissions, in line with relevant legislation, that may or may not have been originally attached by the Planning Authority.Section 48(3)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 ensures that, in stating the basis for determining the contributions, the planning authority must have regard to the actual estimated cost of providing the classes of public infrastructure and facilities.  Policy guidance on the issue was provided to planning authorities in the form of circular letters (PD 4/2003 and PD 5/2007) from my Department.  It is open to an applicant for planning permission to appeal a planning decision to An Bord Pleanála if the applicant considers that the terms of a development contribution scheme or supplementary development contribution scheme have not been properly applied in respect of any planning condition laid down by the planning authority.My Department does not operate a system or scheme of grant assistance to fund private sector recycling centres.  At present, grant assistance is only available to local authorities under the Waste Recycling Capital Grants Scheme (2007-2013).  Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, I may not exercise any power or control in a particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála may be concerned.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	841	My objective in relation to milk quota is to ensure that as much quota as possible is made available to active milk producers.  The person concerned last produced milk in excess of 20% of his quota in the 2005/2006 milk quota year.  He produced only a nominal amount of milk in 2007/2008 and had no production in 2008/2009.  When no deliveries have been recorded against a milk quota for two consecutive years the quota is deemed dormant and it is generally added to the National Reserve.On this basis the quota in question will become dormant on 1st April 2010.  However, where quota is added to the National Reserve it remains available to the former quota holder, or his successor, if they resume production within two years.  The person in this case can at any time transfer his quota with land to his son.  Other options available to him if he wishes to avoid his quota becoming dormant are: resume milk production; transfer the milk quota without land to a family member who is currently in milk production; sell it with land on the open market; retain it and sell into the next Milk Quota Trading Scheme.

The strategy was approved by the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in May 2008.One of the measures recommended in the strategy was the setting up of a national implementation group and the membership of that group was also outlined.  The membership of the group was established in accordance with the recommendations in the strategy document.  The focus of the group is to engage the Department and its agencies in co-operation with the salmon farming industry to enhance pest control and management in the context of good husbandry practice.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	843	Under section 2 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 a person is liable to pay the pensions-related deduction if he or she is a public servant on or after 1 March 2009 and is a member of a public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme or receives a payment in lieu of membership of such a scheme.  Therefore, even if a person is not a member of a public service pension scheme, he or she is subject to the deduction if he or she is a member of another public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme (eg has a preserved benefit, is in receipt of a pension from another public service pension scheme or if he or she is entitled to a non-pensionable gratuity) or receives a payment in lieu of membership.The person to whom you refer may be entitled to a non-pensionable gratuity.  This is a gratuity payable to certain staff of VECs and institutes of technology who have given service with a VEC or institute of technology and whose service is not reckonable for superannuation purposes under the pension schemes of those bodies.  The non-pensionable gratuity is paid in the form of a lump sum and is calculated at the rate of one week's pay for each year of service up to 15 years plus two weeks' pay for each year of service over 15 weeks, subject to a maximum 78 weeks.  Payment of the gratuity is made under the terms of the Local Government (Superannuation) (Gratuities) Regulations 1984 and 1995 which were made under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980.The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 defines a "public service pension scheme" as an occupational pension scheme or pension arrangement, by whatever name called, for any part of the public service provided for under any enactment or administrative measure for the like purpose and effect as the Superannuation Acts.  The non-pensionable gratuity regulations provide a form of pension arrangement, apply to certain parts of the public service (including VECs and institutes of technology) and have their basis in the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980.  A person with the required level of service is entitled to a non-pensionable gratuity under such an arrangement and therefore falls within section 2(1)(b)(ii) of the Act.  They are, therefore, subject to the deduction.It should be noted, however, that under section 6 of the Act, if a person does not accrue a superannuation benefit in respect of this service at the time of his or her ceasing to be a public servant, the deduction is refundable to him or her.

Payment is made on receipt of original provider invoices submitted by the school authorities to my Department.I assume that the Deputy is referring to schools where prefabs have been sanctioned by my Department but where the school authorities have yet to submit invoices for the January — June 2009 rental period.  Of the 918 schools renting prefabs in 2009, 899 schools have received payment and 19 have yet to submit invoices for payment for the January — June 2009 rental period.  Officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department have recently made contact with the schools where rental grant-aid is outstanding, requesting invoices to be submitted for payment.In July of 2008, I introduced a new scheme which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation which is likely to last for more than 3 years, and who are being given approval for grant aid, to avail of the option of using their grants either to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.  My Department has approved the purchase of 120 prefabricated rooms for 87 schools this year with schools having the option of constructing permanent rooms instead.  One school has drawn down funding under this scheme to date.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	845	As the Deputy will be aware, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 provides that a child (defined as a person who is not more than 18 years) with special educational needs shall be educated in an inclusive environment unless such an arrangement is inconsistent with the best interests of the child as determined by an assessment carried out under the EPSEN Act or with the effective provision of education for those children with whom the child is to be educated.  The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools in their locality.In supporting and promoting an inclusive education policy, supports are provided to schools through the National Council for Special Education so that children with special educational needs may attend their local mainstream school where possible.  These supports may be in the form of resource teaching, special needs assistants and technological support.In addition, my Department funds over 100 special schools, including a number which cater for children with a physical disability.  It is the policy of my Department that these special schools draw on a range of teaching and other interventions.  In this context, I am aware that some schools have employed elements of conductive education which have been beneficial to some students with a motor disorder.  My Department has however no plans at present to develop initiatives based exclusively on the principles of conductive education.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard,  a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  It is not unusual for some second-level schools to prioritise named feeder schools in their admissions policies.  This often reflects long standing connections between certain schools.However, in formulating an admissions policy a school must ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.  In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street,  Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.

The Department's prioritisation criteria were amended in 2004 and the Band rating for this project was amended from a Band 1 rating under the old criteria to a Band 2.2 rating under the amended criteria.  The amended band rating is in accordance with the situation in the school where there is a deficit of mainstream accommodation and the deficit constitutes a substantial and significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.
