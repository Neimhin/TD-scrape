#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	0	I welcome everyone to the meeting. No apologies have been received. If attending in the committee room, attendees are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that, to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament. The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied this morning by Mr. Leonard McKeown, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This morning, we will engage with officials from the Office of Public Works to examine the following: from the 2021 Appropriation Account, Vote 13 - Office of Public Works, OPW; and from the Comptroller and Auditor General’s 2021 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services: Chapter 8 - Contract payments in respect of Convention Centre Dublin. Information was also requested from the OPW regarding its evaluation of its expenditure for value for money, and this is in the context of a related provision in the committee’s orders of reference. We are joined by the following officials from the OPW: Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman; Mr. Ciaran O'Connor, State architect; Mr. Jim Casey, head of flood risk management; Mr. Martin Bourke, commissioner; Mr. Mick Long, director of corporate services; and Ms Rosemary Collier, assistant secretary. We are also joined by Ms Marie Mulvihill from the relevant Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. They are all very welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are on silent or switched off. Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, I may direct witnesses to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative they comply with any such directions. Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Before we move to opening statements, Mr. Buckley is welcome. As mentioned, the committee requested information from the OPW and from Mr. Buckley, as Accounting Officer for the OPW, in relation to value for money. This was so the committee could assess whether Mr. Buckley can demonstrate that value for money has been achieved in the accounts under his responsibility. Clarity was sought by his office as to what was required. The clerk contacted me in relation to this and, following that discussion, advised Mr. Buckley's office that answers were required to each of the eight questions set out in the document, and as the request was in addition to the usual material, the answers could be concise. Despite this, Mr. Buckley's response provided a short overview of his efforts to assess expenditure for value for money without any reference to the questions asked by the committee. I note that Mr. Buckley was advised of the committee’s intention to engage with him today on 13 November, the formal invitation issued on 21 November and the request for the value for money information issued on 28 November. We feel sufficient notice was given. I would be grateful if Mr. Buckley could set out why we have not received answers to those eight questions. It is a framework the committee has and we have put a lot of thought into putting it together. It is part of our obligations under standing orders. I ask Mr. Buckley to explain why we do not have that here this morning.

The request is one that we have not dealt with before. I appreciate it is part of the new procedure but at a time when we were preparing a lot of information for the committee on the briefing, we were taken a little by surprise by the request. We should not have been and I appreciate the need to put the information together and that we are late coming back. I apologise for that.

We understand there is a lot of preparation work for the Accounting Officer coming in but the fact is that we do not have it here this morning. The OPW has a large brief and a large budget, and there is no argument with that. We are anxious that when Accounting Officers come in, they comply with that. We would appreciate it if that could be followed up on. We accept this is the first time for Mr. Buckley to receive that particular request in that format. We ask that his office would respond to it within the next two weeks under those eight headings.

I will move on. I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	5	The 2021 appropriation account for Vote 13 records gross expenditure of €492.5 million. The account is presented under two programme headings: €99.6 million, or 20% of the total, was spent on the flood risk management programme; and just under €393 million was spent on the estate management programme.The OPW provides office and other accommodation to Departments and offices using a combination of leased and State-owned property. The associated costs are a direct charge on the Vote. This includes rent payments totalling €103 million; expenditure on new works, alterations and additions costing €97 million; and property maintenance and supply payments totalling just over €64 million. The account records the value of State-owned land and buildings at the year end at just over €3.4 billion. Apart from the activity accounted for under Vote 13, the OPW also acts on an agency basis on behalf of Departments and State agencies. This mainly relates to the carrying out of major capital works and the leasing of accommodation. The expenditure associated with this agency activity is reflected in the accounts of the client Departments and agencies. Total agency expenditure handled by the OPW amounted to almost €184 million in 2021. This brings the aggregate value of the expenditure handled by the OPW to €676 million in the year. The surplus on the Vote at the year end was €40.4 million. Of this, unspent capital allocations for flood risk management to the value of €20.7 million were carried over to 2022. The balance of €19.7 million was surrendered back to the Exchequer. I issued a clear audit opinion with regard to the appropriation account but drew attention to two matters disclosed in the statement on internal financial control. First, the Accounting Officer discloses that there was a material level of procurement charged to the Vote that was not compliant with public procurement rules. Second, he sets out the level of expenditure on two measured-term maintenance contracts, where the amount actually spent was very significantly in excess of the original estimated value. Total expenditure to the end of 2021 was €103.3 million on a contract put in place in 2018 that had an anticipated value of €15 million. Chapter 8 of my report on the accounts of the public services examined how the OPW has managed certain contract-related underperformance in the operation of the Convention Centre Dublin. The convention centre is operated by a private special purpose company under a public private partnership, PPP, agreement with the OPW. PPPs are agreements between the State and a private partner where the inherent risks of a project or enterprise are intended to be assigned to the party better positioned to manage them. The financial terms of the deal should fairly reflect the allocation of the risks. In the case of the convention centre, the State is committed to a stream of expenditure over 25 years, in the form of regular unitary payments. In 2021, these amounted to €23.8 million. The primary objective for the State in entering the PPP agreement is to increase Ireland’s share of the international conference market, thereby increasing incoming tourism revenues. Under the terms of the PPP agreement, there is provision for a modest reduction in the annual unitary charge amounts payable to the operator when the number of international delegates falls below specified minimum levels. Due to the impact of the Covid-related restrictions on travel and indoor gatherings, the operator did not reach the target minimum level of international conference delegates. Under the PPP arrangement, the State was obliged to pay the bulk of the annual unitary charge. Due to the shortfall in international delegate numbers, however, an estimated €1.32 million was due for withholding in the period August 2020 to July 2022, with a further estimated €190,000 due to be withheld in the period August 2022 to July 2023. Pending the outcome of negotiations with the operator, the OPW paid the full unitary payment amounts that were otherwise due for the periods under review, without the specified deduction. In my view, this represents an overpayment of the amount due under the contract.

As detailed in his letter of invitation, Mr. Buckley has five minutes for his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	7	I thank the Chairman and members for their invitation to attend this meeting. I am joined by a number of members of the OPW management board. Beside me are Mr. Mick Long, head of corporate services, and Mr. Martin Bourke, head of estate management. In front of me is Mr. Jim Casey, head of flood risk management, Ms Rosemary Collier, head of heritage services and capital delivery, and Mr. Ciaran O’Connor, State and principal architect. Ms Marie Mulvihill also joins us from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I hope the advance brief and updates provided to the committee included sufficient information on the matters raised in recent correspondence. I apologise again for the late submission of the value-for-money papers. I just checked and three cases have been provided. However, I am very happy to answer any queries on the updates provided or any other matters the Chairman or members wish to raise with me and my management board colleagues today. I will present some summary output information on the 2021 appropriation account for Vote 13 and comment further on matters raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the chapter of his report entitled Contract payments in respect of Convention Centre Dublin. However, I will first outline to the committee the essential role the OPW plays in how Government and the State deliver on a wide variety of projects for the Irish people. Our vision is to maintain "our built and natural environments in harmony" and our purpose is to provide the Government and the public with versatile, innovative and specialist services. I will refer to just some of those specialist services provided to Government. We are the State’s lead body on flood risk management. We provide office space for more than 40,000 public servants. We maintain and showcase national monuments and important historic buildings such as Leinster House, where we are today. We manage public parks and gardens. We oversee the State art collection and when called upon, we co-ordinate and organise State events. The OPW's greatest strength is its people. They bring a focus and commitment to their roles and have a wide range of expertise and experience across the property and heritage estates and flood risk management. Projects and requirements of Governments frequently change. What is constant, however, is the need for the State to have the expertise and capability to deliver on its plans for our people. That need is highlighted in the OPW's recent role in the State's response to the Ukraine humanitarian crisis, our ongoing work on the response to Brexit and the continuing delivery of infrastructure projects under the national development plan. As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, the 2021 gross expenditure of the OPW was €493 million. In addition to the information on expenditure presented to the committee today in respect of Vote 13, I must point out that the OPW acts as an important delivery agent, undertaking work on behalf of Departments and State agencies. Expenditure on this activity in 2021 amounted to an additional €184 million. This appears as a charge on the accounts of the client organisations. Exchequer funding to the OPW supports two core programmes of work, that is, flood risk management and estate management, which includes heritage services. Almost €100 million was invested under the flood risk management programme in 2021, reflecting the significant growth in the number of schemes in the design and planning stage leading through to construction in recent years. As part of the OPW multifaceted approach to flood relief, we continue to implement a suite of infrastructural and other measures to mitigate the impact of flooding on people, homes, properties and businesses. More than 300 communities around the country, which are home to approximately 3 million citizens, will benefit from the current investment programme. An amount of €393 million was invested in estate management in the past accounting year. We have one of the largest, most complex and wide-ranging property portfolios in the State. It includes 2,500 properties that are managed as a shared service for over 80 Government bodies within a very complex working environment.This responsibility has become all the more essential for the State as the OPW supports the design and delivery of the workplace of the future for the Irish Civil Service. In the aftermath of the pandemic, both our future and our workplaces will be different, and we are addressing the most urgent issues of climate change and sustainability. The OPW is at the coalface of these issues across its remit. In delivering the workplace of the future we are working with clients to develop more sustainable and innovative accommodation solutions, including a number of notable retrofit projects happening within the OPW portfolio. In order to carry out its functions, the OPW uses a mix of in-house expertise and outsourced services, contracted through a wide variety of appropriate public procurement channels, including the measured term contract to which the Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers. The procurement of these services is cost-effective, compliant and conducted in a transparent manner and while developing these methods, I am conscious of the ongoing needs to meet the compliance and transparency requirements of the Government. Procuring works through framework contracts often represents the most efficient mechanism for the delivery of maintenance and small works services in particular. While the demand on the Dublin-based measured term maintenance contract was underestimated when it was established, it nevertheless proved to be essential in delivering on the urgent critical infrastructure needed to prepare Departments and the State for the impact of Brexit. Brexit is an example of the OPW being called upon to carry out essential works for the Government at short notice. The initial request was for facilities at Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort. However, what started as nine projects eventually grew to become 28 projects for four Departments. This meant as a country we were prepared for the changes that ensued when the UK left the customs union. While it was not anticipated that the contract would be needed for projects of this scale, it nevertheless ensured essential infrastructure was delivered by more than 60 small and medium-sized subcontractors in labour-intensive works within the required deadlines, while controlling costs and ensuring value for money. Separately, the appropriation account refers to a significant increase in the value of non-compliance within procurement rules. As referenced, the sum of €18 million refers to regional spend on regional building maintenance works. This procurement process was based on a list system of engaging multiple small and medium-sized enterprise contractors across the nationwide portfolio. Contracts in excess of the advertising threshold of €50,000 were awarded by way of competitive requests for tender. However, this system has since been proven not to be fully compliant with the current rules. In collaboration with the Office of Government Procurement and the local government operational procurement centre, the process of moving to a compliant system of procurement for these contracts is well under way. This will see the level of contracts awarded in this manner reduced by 50% in 2022 and they will continue to fall as contracts are closed out and new procurement frameworks are established. From a wider perspective, an ongoing programme of procurement compliance improvements is being progressed across all sections of the OPW. A corporate procurement plan for the OPW is now in place and will be implemented under the auspices of a relatively newly-formed procurement advisory unit and an internal procurement network. The OPW, while initially seeing an increase in the non-compliant returns on procurement reported through greater transparency, is now much better placed to deliver procurement compliance into the future, while still achieving the flexibility needed for the work of the OPW. The Office of Government Procurement has engaged in detail with us on this matter and has been of tremendous assistance in our drive towards speedily reducing the level of non-compliance procurements while ensuring our continued ability to deliver for government. I will update the committee on the latest position in relation to the performance at the convention centre in Dublin. This matter is a relatively complex one and I am still considering legal advice and the position of the parent Department, namely, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on this matter. I have also decided to seek further advice from EUROSTAT and from the Department of Public and Expenditure and Reform on the options available, before reverting to the Convention Centre Dublin and making a final decision on the matter. I will revert to the committee once a decision has been made by the OPW on this. I thank my colleagues in the OPW for their work in delivering services as we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. I am honoured to work with such a dedicated team in the OPW and I am very proud of the long legacy that the OPW has in delivering services to the Irish people across the country.I thank the Chairman and the committee members for their time, and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for its work and recommendations. I welcome any questions.

It is appreciated. We appear to have the whole shooting gallery here, which is great. I will start by touching first on the maintenance contracts, and particularly the measured term maintenance contracts. In the period from 2020 to date, were any works carried out that were in excess of the €500,000 with regard to those contracts?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	10	Yes. Most of the Brexit projects we refer to were well in excess of the €500,000 guideline.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	11	Mr. Buckley said "well in excess". Perhaps he could just expand on that and the period.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	12	The Brexit works were in the period from 2019, with the very last works closing out this year, or having closed out. In total across that period, I am told by my colleague here that it was in the region of €71 million.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	13	Is that €71 million over and above, or is that just Brexit related?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	14	In that, as I just said in my statement, there were some 29 projects. I can check it exactly but I would say that every one of them was more than €500,000 in value.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	15	When we last engaged on this, the criticism was from 2015 to 2018. The OPW was tendering contracts at €3 million but spending €10 million. Then the OPW was tendering contracts at €5 million but spending €25 million. There is a quare difference between €3 million and €10 million, and between €5 million and €25 million. Why is the OPW so unable to accurately forecast?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	16	It is very important to explain that what we are talking about there is a framework contract, which consists of lots of individual projects. Lest anybody listening would misunderstand, it is not that the work cost more than anticipated: it is that more projects were done than anticipated.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	17	But this is the maintenance contract, so if the tender was for €3 million, surely one would have been able to forecast what needed doing and to issue the contract for €3 million. But then to pay €10 million-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	20	Because more projects were required and done.

This happened in 2018 and 2019. Does the OPW not learn from past mistakes? It actually happened in 2015 if we go back.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	24	It comes really from the period of Ireland coming out of financial recession of 2010 and the-----

It appears that the OPW does not seem to learn from its mistakes. Each year, it issues the contract and it goes to three times - more recently five times - above the original tender amount. Lessons do not appear to be learned.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	26	They have been learned certainly. I must state again-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	28	I am going to demonstrate how that-----

Is that right? It commenced this year and the works were valued at €10 million.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	30	It is €10 million per annum.

Going by its track record, that €10 million could end up being €50 million.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	32	There are a number of points there. We have developed a number of parallel frameworks. At the time we are talking about, there was a single measured-term maintenance contract in place for all of greater Dublin. Now there are two - north Dublin and south Dublin approximately. There are a number of other specific framework contracts for works required. For example, there is a frequent requirement for office fit-outs at very short notice. We have learned from experience in the past that in order to meet the timelines required by the Department, we had to use the measured-term maintenance contract in order to get the transparency and control we needed. We have specific frameworks in place.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	33	Therefore, Mr. Buckley could pretty much guarantee us that it will not go over that €10 million by a factor of multiples because he has just said the OPW has learned and put measures in place. How can he seriously expect us to have confidence? Is he telling us that we can have confidence that the OPW has learned from its mistakes, such as the blowing of taxpayers' money and not being able to adequately forecast, and that it has corrected all that and will not go over this framework of €10 million this year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	34	It is very important that I repeat that this is not overspending of taxpayers' money.

We have gone through that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	36	I just wanted to make sure it is understood-----

Mr. Buckley said there were additional works but the OPW was not able to forecast those works and yet that is the job it is tasked with. Regarding the €10 million and that the OPW has learned lessons and has put frameworks in place, can Mr Buckley guarantee the committee that it will not go over that €10 million and we will not see the constant mistakes of the past?

Let us just start from the €10 million. It is clear to everyone that the OPW has not done that. With each tender issued, the amount went over by multiples. Has the OPW got its act together with the new €10 million framework? Can Mr. Bourke guarantee that it will not blow taxpayers' money in multiples because it has not been able to adequately forecast the amount of work that needs to be done and the cost?

Is it a complex matter? Is there a requirement to seek further legal advice or is it pretty much clear-cut that this money should have been deducted? Was this lackadaisical?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	122	My interpretation is that the money should have been deducted and that this specific matter is relatively clear. It goes back to the sharing of risks when you get into a contract and that is why it takes a long time to put a contract like this in place. You have to figure out who is carrying out what risk. Sometimes the risk goes against you and you pay the price. If the boot was on the other foot and the Convention Centre Dublin was entitled to a greater payment then it would demand to receive it.

The State's financial watchdog is telling the OPW that this contract was clear, that the OPW did not follow through and that it was lackadaisical with taxpayers' money. The OPW could not give a hoot or a damn. How dare they.

Here was a contract that stipulated clearly that the money was to be handed back. The witnesses have come in with an attitude of "Who shot John" and have said that complex legal advice has been sought. We have asked the State's financial watchdog whether or not that contract was clear and we have been told it was. The OPW was lackadaisical with taxpayers' money.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	134	I will respond to all the comments that were made in that protracted period. The most important thing to understand is that when you have a long 25 or 30-year contract like we have, if a dispute or issue arises along the way, that is clarified and agreed with the parties and it is addressed in the contract. While that is being done, the correct legal practice is that you do not stop the payments first. Rather, you continue to pay the contractual amounts and you deal with the dispute separately. It is a technicality - and I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General will agree with this - in any disputed contract you deal with the dispute but while that is being dealt with you are legally obliged to carry on servicing the contract as written. There are 14 years in this and there is no mad urgency to it. It is important to get this correct. We do not want to be in complex legal disputes that cost money and we will get this correct. It is not as simple as just applying the terms. The contract itself is simple but the circumstances are not, as Mr. Bourke explained. We will address this. There is a balance here. In this committee we are looking at the financial terms of the contract and, as the Accounting Officer I also have to look at the overall project of the Convention Centre Dublin and its success in building delegate numbers so that when that comes back to the State in 14 years time it will be a healthy business that the State can then pick up and drive forward. That is the balance.

I want to focus on flooding and flood prevention. I ask the witnesses to outline for me what the OPW's value-for-money measures are regarding passing ongoing flood works. What would be standard? I only have ten minutes so I ask the witnesses to do that in a relatively succinct way.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	138	I will do my best to be succinct. As the Deputy knows, we have a large number of flood risk projects of different shapes and sizes running in parallel. There is a series of value-for-money controls in those projects. First, we go through the procurement system twice. We do so once to build a design team with all the expertise needed for the particular project, which is a competitive process. We do so the second time when the project comes to construction. We go to tender to get the best construction contractors, the best price and the best quality for the State. During both of those phases we have project teams of experts who are involved in regular project meetings, usually on a monthly basis. They are also engaged in project oversight, credit controls-----

At the design phase we rely on computer modelling to assess the hydrology of the river involved and what the impact of the works will be. We would immediately, on completion of a flood scheme, or continuously, monitor levels in rivers. We have a system of water monitoring.

We work closely with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, but we run a network of gauges, automatic and manual, across the country. That feeds into information on what river levels are and what the likelihood of flooding is. It also allows us to immediately monitor the performance of any completed scheme. On the point the Deputy made, we must ask if the problem is pushed down the river somewhere and make sure the design has been effective. If there are any tweaks-----

There was a significant flood there in 2009 when 120 homes were flooded. Then a major project was done in 2016. From what I can see the number quoted for the project was €18 million, although I notice in the numbers we have received today that it is €34.5 million. Then there was a significant flood in 2020. The original project was a 200-year flood prevention plan.It was completed around 2018. That is two years before it flooded significantly again, so that is a 1% effectiveness. Judging from the OPW's own numbers today, we are talking about nearly double the cost now. I presume there are ongoing works. I am sure there is some kind of ratio calculation there about a 1% effectiveness versus a 200-year cost. In this case the flood project comprised 3 km of flood walls, 4 km of embankments and a number of storm water pumping stations. Obviously, most of that work was not effective in 2020. What happens in such cases?

As I said, we could talk about areas in Cork or elsewhere. There are loads of towns where this is happening. The people of Skibbereen saw major works and a lot of concrete poured, yet the town flooded in 2020. My question to Mr. Casey is, regardless of whether Waterways Ireland, the ESB or whoever else it might be has some tangential issue here or whether there is a lack of drainage, the OPW, ultimately, is tasked as a body with flood prevention and has spent the money and the town flooded. Since that has happened, what is the plan now? What are the measures in place? The cost-benefit analysis here does not stand up. It does not matter whose fault it was. Also, just in bare terms, the risk does not stand up in respect of the houses that are there. The OPW is tasked with protecting people, so what is the plan going forward and what measures does it have in place to-----

We can talk about how the OPW works tangentially with local authorities, the ESB, Waterways Ireland or whoever it might be. That may be part of the answer, but what is being said is the flood scheme did not fail although Skibbereen was flooded.

She has asked me what we are doing now after that event. We are engaging with Cork County Council to understand the nature of that particular event. We do that as a matter of course. In fact, we ask local authorities to report to us after every flood event to give an explanation of the nature of it. We assess that in conjunction with the local authorities and we are doing that in the case of Skibbereen. If further measures are required, we will ensure they are brought forward.

To be clear, where the OPW has an instance like this, of course responsibility is shared and it is a complex issue, but you could say that about every single area in the country. I remember the floods around the Shannon. There was a lake around my brother's house. The ESB was involved in that. Where huge amounts of money have been spent and an area has still flooded, even if it is outwith the terms of the OPW's own flood project, how does the OPW measure the effectiveness of the flood relief capital projects? If the OPW is simply washing its hands and saying that is outside its terms of reference, that does not really help the people in the 120 houses.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	183	The Deputy raises a very good point and it just emphasises the huge complexity of the flooding issue in Ireland, even without the climate change dimension, which is escalating the whole problem even more. I reassure the Deputy, however, that we work very closely with Irish Water in particular because drainage is a huge factor and, as the Deputy will know, Irish Water has an enormous investment programme in place to upgrade the drainage system and to separate runoff water from the main sewer systems in many towns in Ireland, and they are very often the same towns where we do flood schemes. Bandon is another example.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	185	We can come back to the design of the schemes, but on the Deputy's point, we link in with the local authorities, Irish Water and other agencies involved. I certainly do not want to say it is somebody else's responsibility and, therefore, we are not interested. That is not the case at all. My understanding of 2020, which I was just recalling while the Deputy was speaking, was that in August 2020 there was an incredible downpour of rain in the Skibbereen area. That cannot be predicted and will happen, I am afraid, more and more often. It can happen anywhere in the country. It happens all over Europe. It is almost impossible to design for that. I reassure the Deputy, however, that the flooding that occurred in Skibbereen was on the N71, the approach road, due to culverts on the road and, to the best of my understanding, properties were not flooded during that event, thankfully.

I wish to continue on the flood relief issue. My understanding was ten flood relief capital projects were ongoing in 2021. There was accumulated expenditure of €173 million, but my understanding is those ten projects will now cost around €213 million. Where are we with those ten projects? Are they finished? What is the final outturn in respect of the total cost?

In the first three phases we evaluate options and go through the planning process and the detailed design. Only at the end of that stage can the cost of the scheme be estimated with any real accuracy. Therefore, it is not that the cost has increased, that we are paying more for the same thing. It is that the scope of the works needed to give the protection required has been greater than was initially-----

As for recently completed projects, the Douglas-Togher scheme, for example. was opened recently and Bandon is now fully complete. Specifically on those ten, unless Mr. Casey has it to hand, we might have to come back to the Deputy.

I will move on. I refer to the timescale of the projects. Two specific projects in my constituency are the Glashaboy flood relief scheme and the Blackpool flood relief scheme. The Glashaboy scheme went out for tender before the whole project was abandoned and we are now back to square one. What is the timeframe now? Glashaboy was affected by serious flooding more than ten years ago and here we are, ten years on, and still absolutely nothing has been done.

The timescale is that we expect to be going to tender before the end of this year, possibly next week.

Therefore, all the documentation was already prepared. Why not invite in tenders within the following two or four weeks? Why does it take another eight months to again invite tenders?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	205	The reason we took longer to prepare tenders than what the Deputy outlined is that we changed the scope of work with a view to completing the project earlier than we would otherwise have done. We took some of the works out of the main contract in order to do them ahead of this next main contract. We assessed that, overall, the completion date for the works would be accelerated and we would recover some of the otherwise lost time. Just to clarify, the reason for not being able to proceed with the contract was due to hyperinflation and unusual circumstances.

If the OPW decides to invite tenders this week or within the next ten days, what is the timescale for all the documentation to come in, that is, submissions received from those who are interested in carrying out the work, and the acceptance time period?

My understanding is that with many contracts - I have come across them in relation to schools and other Departments - there is a huge delay from the time the submissions are received to the time the decision is taken. We had inflation in the intervening period and the contractors could not do the project at the price they submitted.

Assuming there are no complications, they typically take up to two months. However, there are exceptions and there can be complications in tender processes. In fact, one may often need to seek clarifications in relation to tenders, etc. Depending on the degree of complication, it can take longer.

I am just saying we are now in a different timescale because of inflation and there is a need to put in place contracts at an earlier time than what the current process seems to be.

In the past five days, I was approached by a subcontractor who was cheaper than other subcontractors for a particular project. The OPW instructed the main contractor not to accept this subcontractor even though it had done work previously on OPW projects. It was cheaper and cost-effective, yet the main contractor was instructed not to take it on. Why would that arise?

When the Government forms a contract, that needs to be adjusted. Deputy Murphy will know that from projects in Leinster House on which he has worked with us on. In the set-up that is there at the moment, one has to get the main contract and then the mechanical, electrical and other specialists. Until all of those are co-aligned, one cannot place the main contract.

We seem to have projects that will take the OPW six or seven years and the private sector will get them done in three years. Should we not be looking at how the private is able to deliver in a far shorter timeframe?

I think the OPW proved in Brexit and what we are doing with the Ukrainian project that we can move at great speed - faster than anybody else. However, we have to operate within the rules given to us. The rules given to us by Government are the Government form of contract. That is a flawed document in my clear view and it needs to be looked at. We have to work within that.

On projects currently in the pipeline, how many will have work commenced by this time next year?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	261	To put that in context, that was to provide facilities for Rosslare as an interim to the project that is now out to tender, which is the complete renewal Rosslare Europort. So it was an interim process. When the new port is built we will re-use and repurpose that site for other purposes and the buildings are designed as such. The buildings that are there can be converted to many other uses, immediately for storage and immediately for other elements.

There has been a proposal by a lot of other stakeholders, such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Wexford County Council, that the current facility in Rosslare be divided and used for the parking of HGV vehicles under the Road Safety Act. Has the OPW been involved in that?

Trucks are parking on the side of the road. The facility has not been provided in the way that an undertaking was given here at this committee, as well as other meetings of the transport committee. That facility still has not been provided. I ask Mr. O'Connor to give the committee, for the benefit of road safety, the correspondence the OPW has had from TII and the other stakeholders on preparing the facility. This is not about me getting on to the OPW; this is about joining the dots and giving value for money if we spend €10 million. I was involved in the haulage sector for 25 years so I know that there is never more than four to five trucks at the facility but there is parking spaces for 54 trucks. We do not need another facility to park HGVs. We need to give value for money to the Exchequer to utilise that space. In particular, at this point in time, we should not have anybody parked on the side of the road where there is an extremely busy community. There is a school that has over 300 children located right beside the facility and we should not have trucks anywhere near the roadside when the facility is virtually idle. I do not consider the facility to be value for money at this point in time. Maybe it will be in the future but at this point in time the facility is underutilised. We can save the Exchequer a lot of money by utilising it to its full potential because it is going to be at least five years before we see infrastructural change in Rosslare port. I do not want to know, Mr. O'Connor. The bottom line is that the facility is underutilised. The committee is here to discuss value for money and public Exchequer funding. The facility needs to be prepared and I need to see the correspondence to get that work done. I wish to discuss the flooding of Bridgetown. Last year, on Christmas Day, we had serious floods in Bridgetown and I suppose this is Mr. Casey's area. I heard Mr. Buckley mention certain monitoring stations. Can Mr. Casey tell me which monitoring station did not work, thus resulting in Bridgetown and surrounding areas being flooded on Christmas Day?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	271	The Bridgetown event last Christmas was the result of very intense and extreme rainfall. It was of a nature that is almost impossible to predict given its convective nature. High-intensity events of short duration can happen. Tragically, there was a loss of life there and our sympathies go out to the family of Billy Kinsella and his work colleagues at Wexford County Council.

What is being done differently so we do not see any loss of life or flooding for 2022? What has changed? What has been done?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	273	In June 2022, Wexford County Council made a submission to the OPW. It was an application for funding under our minor works scheme for floodgates and barriers to be installed at impacted properties. Funding of €157,000 was approved by the OPW in July 2022. Wexford County Council has advised that it expects delivery in December. However, delivery of some of the larger barriers may be delayed until the new year. In September of this year, Wexford County Council submitted an additional minor works application to engage consultants to complete a feasibility study on flood impact on the village, to propose mitigation and prevention measures, and to provide preliminary costings and commence a planning strategy in relation to that. The OPW has been engaging with Wexford County Council on the scope of that study.

Does anybody else know? The officials will find the information, as there are 15 people from Mr. Casey's Department here. The fact that we cannot get answers when there are 15 people officials present is gross. If we cannot get an answer then why are 15 people here? Why, in the name of God? It is a farce that an entourage is brought to a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts to sit in the balcony.

I know that everybody is getting paid today but what reason they are here is beyond me because I cannot get an answer to my simple question.

When it comes to flooding, we seem all the time to be closing the stable door when the horse has bolted.Why do we know what the issue is now? I have spoken to the locals and been there. I spent Christmas Day in Bridgetown and Enniscorthy and my Christmas holidays last year visiting people who were put out of their homes. They were not compensated or restored in any way to where they were before this event. Their criticism of the OPW is that it was all preventable. In most cases, prevention is better and cheaper than the cure. The point is that the sluice gates which are not working and no longer manned in Bridgetown are now the answer. That is what it seems. The locals, who were never engaged, were well aware that this was the issue and had warned of it on a number of occasions. It is now a year later and in that period, action has not been taken.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	295	Deputy Murphy is highlighting the core issue, which is that every community in Ireland, all over the country, is at risk of flooding, whether river, rain or coastal flooding. It is a huge problem which will escalate enormously in the next while.

Why is it being done after the horse has bolted? From everything I have read, that seems to be the trademark of the OPW. It has happened in Enniscorthy, Blackwater and now in Bridgetown, to a severe degree.

We have been working for a long time, as the Deputy knows, to the frustration of the community, the council and everybody else because of the challenges faced there. We had a scheme ready to go in 2009 but it involved high walls along the side of the river, which is understandably unacceptable to the community, because while there is a danger to human life and property, there is a community living in the town and it is part of the infrastructure of the town.

That involved removing the Séamus Rafter bridge and building a new bridge outside town. From an environmental perspective, which is difficult territory, it involved deepening the riverbed. That riverbed has trace amounts of fresh oyster pearl mussels, lamprey and vegetation. This is always a subjective matter of opinion. We and our experts felt that this could be compensated and would restore two or three years after the work was done on the river. The experts used by the Minister in making the consent assessment came to a different conclusion. That can happen. The world is changing. We are totally focused on human life, properties and risk.

I refer to the Convention Centre Dublin. It is not a place I want to go back to. We are happy to be here. We were happy to be accommodated at the time but I do not have fond memories of it. As the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states, the Covid-19 pandemic was an unforeseen event. It also states that under the terms of the public private partnership agreement, there is provision for a modest reduction in the unitary charge payments when the number of international delegates falls below a minimum standard. I have a particular interest in one area, which is the bonuses paid in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Quite a substantial amount, totalling several hundred thousand, was paid. Was that paid to all eight directors? Was it equally shared?

That is the reality. Who has oversight of something like bonus payments? I found it quite difficult to understand why a bonus payment would be made at all. Where is the oversight of that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	333	As it is a public private partnership, the business affairs of the other party, which actually runs the Convention Centre Dublin, are not something that we become involved in. We cannot become involved in them. We oversee the conduct of the project agreement, which is a 250-page legal document which places a certain onus on people to run it in a particular manner, to have international conference delegates, ICDs, to have it open, and so on. Outside that, the matter of individual personnel, how it hires people and how it remunerates people is not something we can become involved in. It goes back to what the Comptroller and Auditor General said earlier. When the State brings in private sector people, they do business in their own way. How much they pay their own people and who they hire or dismiss is not something we can become involved in.

I find it extraordinary that bonuses would be paid. I have asked on a number of occasions about Military Road and the facility there. I pass it reasonably regularly and keep a close eye on it. I know people have moved there. The provision there is less than would have been available in Harcourt Square. Have people completely decanted from Harcourt Square at this stage?

What is going on with Clyde House in Blanchardstown? I am trying to get an overview of how much this is actually costing. We have a rough idea of what the budget for Military Road was but it does not accommodate all the personnel. I want to see what other buildings are being brought into use. Presumably Clyde House is one of those buildings.

Two things have been mixed up. There is an increase in Garda numbers and the other matter is Military Road. Military Road replaced in full the facility in Harcourt Square with regard to the number of people and space.What happened, following us getting planning permission for the project in 2017-18, was that the new Garda Commissioner brought in a set of new bureaus-----

I will explain the number. Some 860 to 900 people were in Harcourt Square. That number is now at Military Road, but all these other units that were set up and brought in under the new Garda plan will bring it up to about 1,400 additional people.

In 2015, in the region of 600 gardaí occupied the Harcourt Square building. Future planning at that time was for 880 gardaí. Some 880 are accommodated at Military Road, which was brought in by Mr. O'Connor, Ms Edel Collins and the team, on time and on budget. It was a very satisfactory project.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	396	The total budget was €86 million, which included the building cost and the fit-out. Approximately 600 gardaí, which is a very good thing for these very important national units that were added to the force in the intervening years, have also been accommodated through various measures that Mr. O'Connor outlined.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	397	The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, offered Harcourt Square - it had been leased - to the OPW for the Garda. Since the Military Road premises had to be built and other Garda units had to be accommodated, in retrospect, was it very poor decision-making not to buy the Harcourt Square building, given all that had to happen since as regards moving the Garda, when the offer to buy it would have been more favourable because it was being bought from NAMA?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	398	The contractor and people who were developing the Harcourt Square building are going to flatten it at the beginning of January. The reason is that the building has many problems. It dates from the 1960s, its layout is not suitable for anyone in modern-day terms and, from our point of view, it would have required such a deep retrofit that it would have cost as much as the new building. The new building on Military Road is an A2-standard building, whereas the Harcourt Square building is a level E. In energy cost and carbon footprint tax terms, it would be a noose around our necks to have it. In addition, Harcourt Square does not have specialist facilities. For instance, the Military Road premises has very specific things in the double basement that are particular to the execution of high-security work - I cannot say more than that - and that were not available to gardaí in Harcourt Square.

The submissions from that were sent to our independent environmental consultants. We continuously engage with them and they have completed their assessment of the submissions and are formalising and finalising their assessment of the overall scheme to make a recommendation to the Minister. This has not yet come to us from the consultants. When it does, it will be submitted to the Minister to either confirm, refuse or alter. We have yet to receive the final overall recommendation from the environmental consultants on the scheme. They review the submissions, examine the overall scheme and the environmental impact assessment report, and then make that recommendation to the Minister encompassing both.

They are looking for a definitive timeline. Is it going to be January or February? Can we get some understanding regarding "shortly" because this project has seen delay after delay and there is considerable frustration among businesses and people. Ms Mulvihill must appreciate where they are coming from. This flooding happened in 2015 and it is seven years on from Christmas 2015. Every time I come in here looking for information, we are given generic responses in replies to parliamentary questions. Today, again, Ms Mulvihill has indicated that it will be done shortly. Can we get a definitive timeline?

As the Deputy may know, the price of concrete and structural steel has gone up significantly in the last while. This has impacted on all of our work, buildings and flood relief schemes. Mr. Casey just discussed with Deputy Colm Burke a scheme in Glashaboy in County Cork, where in the period between issuing the tender and awarding the contract, the contractor said it could not do the job for the price it had tendered because the prices had risen so much in the meantime, and we had to issue the tender again.

All the costings done since the middle of last year have increased the level of inflation that is calculated into the price.

It has not affected us significantly this year, but we expect it will be more of an issue next year and the year after perhaps. On the Glashaboy contract, it was a hyperinflation issue that necessitated the collapse of that tender process. In that sense it did cause very significant delays on that particular project.

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth goes through that list and determines which sites are appropriate from a social point of view and given other considerations they must take into account, such as ensuring there is back-up support for the people moving to those sites. We become involved in the technical assessment. I will be discreet here and say that there was an issue with a number of the sites we were offered, which were not quite the calibre of site we would look for. Some of the sites were very poor quality.

However, if the units are located on sites and the layout is as per local authority specification, design and all of that, have there been discussions with local authorities in respect of after use? There is a substantial cost involved in delivering each unit. It is close to the cost of a new build. I accept that Mr. O'Connor has said about there being a 60-year lifespan for each unit. Have there been discussions with local authorities on after use?

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth runs and looks after the units. Then a Government decision is made on what use they are put to. For instance, the units could be lifted out and sent to Ukraine or they could be moved elsewhere. They are a lift-and-plug type of unit.

That element of the work, which accounts for quite a substantial portion of the €150 million, will be reusable and expand our social housing capacity.

It does not consider whether there are medical facilities in the locality, whether there is capacity in the local schools or whether there is public transport locally. Obviously the OPW will look at the infrastructural criteria such as whether the storm sewers and foul sewers have capacity, what the road infrastructure is like and whether the site is on a flood plain. That is the kind of stuff the OPW would look at.

The first I heard about it was when I saw it in one of the local newspapers. As a local Deputy, as soon as I had bought the paper, questions were coming into my office about it. It puts us in an awful position. I had to say to people straight up that I had only just learned about it having read about it in the local paper. While the OPW is not the sole decision maker in this and I understand that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has a role, there has to be some consultation at local level. Let me be clear; we have to try to help people who are genuinely fleeing war. I hope this war will be over as soon as possible. That is the hope of every sane person on the planet. There is no argument about that. There is capacity in the schools in Rathdowney but there are issues with some of the locations that have been chosen to date. I understand that, in ensuring quick response, perfection can sometimes be the enemy of progress. However, while I will not get into particular areas, some of the locations that have been chosen to date completely lacked the capacity needed and were not suitable for a whole plethora of reasons, rather than just one. There are six councillors in that district and, as far as I know, none of them were consulted. As a local Deputy, I had no answer for people. Nobody thought to lift the phone to us to tell us that such a field was bought and that such a thing was going to be done and to tell us the plan. Nobody sought an opinion or anything. There is a Government Minister of State in the constituency. I do not know if he knew.

At its request, we go along to those meetings. I personally have been at six. One of my staff is actually down at a meeting in Cork as we speak.

I know it is not primarily the OPW's responsibility and I intend to raise it with the Department, as Deputies in the Dáil already have. It needs to be raised with the Department.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	493	It is a very good point. We are aware of this issue and will feed it back. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is also aware. Deputy Dillon will know the site at Claremorris, which is an OPW site. It is proving very difficult in the time we have available. Rathdowney came through the process relatively recently. We have evaluated something like 73 sites in total around the country at this stage. Three quarters are not suitable for some reason or other. We are conscious all of the time of people sleeping in tents and the numbers coming in every day. It is very hard to balance that but we will pass the Chair's comments on to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

Could I have a briefing note within a week? I believe that is a fair timeline. The note should cover the size of the site in Rathdowney, what exactly is planned for it and the timeline for locating the first group there and should include any other information Mr. Buckley feels would be helpful. At least we will then be up to date, even if we were not consulted in the first instance. However, we need to be consulted. We live in a democracy. Whether people like us or not, the 160 of us are elected. I have family roots in that town. I have no answers for people. I cannot tell people anything. I have no information. It is totally unacceptable. I do not mean this in any disrespectful way but I have often said to council officials at public meetings that officials go home at 5 p.m. but that does not stop people ringing our phones or buttonholing us when they next see us, at mass or somewhere else, and asking what we have to say about something, why we did not raise a certain issue or whether we even know what is going on. A number of people rang the office and I had to say that I had no idea and had read about it in the local paper. That is not acceptable. I take on board what the witnesses have said. Speed is an issue here and the OPW has to react quickly. However, I am sure Dáil Deputies would make themselves available to be met with two or three days' notice. I do not want to speak for other Deputies but I would certainly be willing to accommodate that.

I will go back to the discussion my colleague, Deputy Munster, was having with regard to the convention centre, the deductions and so on. Will the witnesses again talk me through the potential deduction from unitary payments in respect of the tenth, 11th and 12th payment years? What were the reasons for not withholding funds or progressing that as far as possible under the agreement?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	496	I will respond first. I may bring Mr. Bourke in on the detail. We explained at the beginning that no decision has been taken yet. We are in dialogue with the convention centre and are getting advice from the various parties involved. As I am sure the Deputy will understand, we have a 30-year contract with the group and, until the issue is resolved and a decision taken and implemented, the contract carries on and we work it. If it is decided to reduce the payment for the years in question, that will be applied as soon as the decision is taken. There will be no loss to the State. It is a question of timing. The bigger question is what decision we are going to make and what is the correct approach. Should that €1.5 million be deducted from the payment? The payments are very large. We are talking about over €20 million a year over a 30-year contract. This is an enormous project which covers the building, the maintenance and the operation of the building. We have to look at this in its totality. As I said earlier, the objective of the State is to successfully build up a convention business that brings tourism, and particularly overseas tourism and delegates, to the centre. The company in place was doing well and meeting the targets for business development until Covid hit. We can talk about the extent to which the risks of Covid should be taken or shared. The company is obviously concerned and it is now obvious that people will travel less for conventions, business meetings and so on. However, surprisingly, the initial feedback is that the company has done quite well in restoring activity to the convention centre in the first period. We also have to take into account that the centre accommodated Dáil Éireann during those periods at no charge to the group. There are different factors involved. Something that might be interesting for Deputies to know and which has not really been in the public domain is that, a few years ago, we supported the operators in putting through a refinancing package for the overall operation. I believe I am correct in saying there was a saving to the State because of that, which is a separate matter.

As Mr. Buckley says, that is a separate matter.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	498	It is more complex.

From our perspective - over the past number of months we have been looking at broadband, the children's hospital and the national lottery - it is apparent that on the private side the operators take the most robust position available to them within every contractual arrangement and it is of interest what the State's overall approach is too. We would take the view, or certainly I would take the view, that the State should be at least as robust in its approach to the different contractual arrangements that it is engaged in in the public private partnership, PPP. When Mr. Buckley says that the OPW will get it resolved, it will make a decision and it will be resolved financially then, would he give me a sense of how long it is taking to make this decision?

I would envisage that by the end of the first quarter of next year - February-March of next year - we should have all the information and that should allow us position and conclude a conversation with the convention centre.

We heard the Comptroller and Auditor General speaking earlier. He has a clear view on a contract. There are people who have the exact opposite view on that. For instance, the Department, which sponsors the convention centre and the whole project, has a view that no deductions should be applied.

The OPW has gone through not one, but two mediations in relation to this. For the information of the committee, this was something that was agreed - I do not know by whom or how - over a decade ago. It was put on ice because of the financial crash. It was then essentially forced back on the agenda by the museum board. The OPW resisted it with mediation. It went away for a second reason I cannot recall. Then it came back on a second mediation, which was, I believe, concluded last year in a way that, it seemed to me, the OPW did not want to be concluded; it has now been forced to progress with a museum that was somebody's idea in 2007. I appreciate that the OPW has been forced to do this through the mediation. Can Mr. Buckley give me a sense of the legal costs involved in 2021 in relation to this mediation or over the two mediations, and how have we ended up in a situation where it appears the OPW is being forced to progress a science museum in the concert hall that does not appear to be necessary because there is a perfectly good functional one out in Sandyford that hundreds of thousands of children have visited over the past number of years? Hundreds of different schools have travelled there via the M50 from all over Ireland to visit. Could Mr. Buckley explain this to me?

The Deputy is correct. Not a decade ago but two decades ago, the commitment was entered into to build a science museum by the OPW, on behalf of the then Government. The story went on from there, as the Deputy outlined. Quite simply, the OPW, in itself, taking a narrow view, has always recognised that we have a binding contract to build this facility. We also have a responsibility as a public body to try to ensure that it is successful, that all the outside circumstances are taken into account, and that we are supporting the broader Government policy and programme. We would certainly have attempted to make connections between the promoters of the Earlsfort Terrace project and the Sandyford science centre and, indeed, with the science gallery in Trinity - there are other developments there.

Initially, there were approximately 13 people involved. It is now down to five or six. Of the key people involved, the chairman is Mr. Michael Collins SC, a barrister. Dr. Danny O'Hare, the former president of DCU, has recently stepped down but he was very involved. He was the previous chairman. Ms Ali Hewson is involved. They were the main parties involved in the arbitration proceedings. There are three or four other people whose names I can supply to the Deputy, but it is on the public record.

The reason that this is so important is because when this was agreed initially there was no science museum in Ireland. There is an excellent science museum, which is not in my constituency. I have no connection to it. However, I have visited it, as have hundreds of thousands of other people. It received support all the way through Covid with the employment scheme and all of the different Covid schemes. Now there is a question about whether it reopens or not. I have no grá for any particular entity but I have a big difficulty with the State being obliged to build something that already exists. I do not understand the rationale for it. This is something that the Committee of Public Accounts, next year, they following year or the year after, will have to return to. This is something that the Comptroller and Auditor General will have to investigate thoroughly. I want it noted today that I do not understand how we can still be obliged to do something from 2007. I am glad to hear the OPW is approaching the matter with robustness. I was glad that it went through the two different arbitrations. I genuinely do not understand it. It will be a matter of note for the future, in particular, for the Comptroller and Auditor General.

Unfortunately, it went down the legal route. The project has many merits and so on but it would be beneficial to tie in other players and have an holistic view.

That is one aspect that is helpful. Earlsfort Terrace is a very important historic building. It was the exhibition building back in the 1800s. It is in a very bad state of repair. People will know the National Concert Hall on the south side of the building. The Government has just approved a major investment in that. However, the other half of the building will need major investment over the next decade in any case to repair it. That offsets to some extent but does not fully answer the questions and concerns raised. However, it is important.

We have now spent ten years on this. The OPW, in fairness, has tried to resist having to progress this, recognising the changing circumstances. There is a private entity that fulfils the function from the perspective of the State. Regarding the scale of the build-out and the fit-out costs, I have never seen a business case. I am not sure whether one exists within the OPW.

This has to be financed. It is certainly to the benefit of the group, which will require further subsidy from the Government to operate the centre, develop a business case, carry out a cost–benefit analysis and go through the public spending code. That process was under way in 2018 and 2019, but was never brought forward. At a particular point in time, the promoters decided "No" and took the arbitration route.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	559	The contract puts the risk on the operator, as all PPPs do. All around the world, including Europe, during the two years of the Covid period, there has been a debate on whether Covid and the restrictions on international travel are classed as a business risk or relate to force majeure circumstances, being outside the normal circumstances. We are cognisant of that. The operators will argue and have argued that Covid is something exceptional that they could not have been expected to anticipate. We are going through the process at the moment. A decision has not been taken. There are pros and cons. We are looking at the financial aspect of the contract and the reduction in sums. As Accounting Officer for the overall project, I have to look at its outcome, which entails a huge building, a huge facility and the potential, or otherwise, to raise tourism numbers related to international business delegate tourism in Dublin. That was the original idea. I know hotel space is chock-a-block at the moment, but, over a 30-year timeframe, the idea is that the convention business would add significantly to Dublin as a city and tourism in Dublin. Ultimately, it is a question of whether the operators will deliver on a thriving business when it is handed back to the State in 13 years. That is an important consideration for the committee also. Right now, we are looking precisely at the contractual terms and the management of risk in a PPP contract. I know the process has taken a little time but we have 13 years and will resolve this. Whatever decision we reach will be applied to the contract within that period.

He subsequently answered my second question, which was whether the OPW is genuinely considering spending €1.3 million of public money when it does not have to. His answer is that the OPW is actively considering it.

Sometimes there would be questions at this committee and elsewhere as to the rational basis for it. We would be told consistently that if there is a legal obligation to pay a sum of money, regardless of what it is, it has to be paid, almost aside from anything else. Could the Comptroller and Auditor General give a view on whether Covid provides a context for State bodies to pay to private contractors money that they are not obliged to pay?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	567	I think there may be an element of policy in that, but, in terms of the contract, it seems to me that this is an overpayment. It is a non-contractual payment. The figure over the three years, for the record, would be €1.5 million. An analogy concerns when traffic collapsed as a result of Covid. At that time, additional payments had to be made by the State because tolls coming into the companies were not at the threshold level.

Therefore, there are these risks. In risk-sharing in PPPs and so on, a distinction is made between general risks, such as those associated with tax going up across the board, and a specific policy change or Government change directed at a specific project. This is a general risk and there is force majeure clause in the contract, but it does not refer to medical emergencies. It does not make an exclusion in relation to something like a pandemic. It was a general risk that was being carried by the company. The overall projected receipt by the company over the 35 years is currently over €760 million.

I draw attention to overpayments in social protection every year. It is incumbent on me in a situation like this, where there are companies that can fight well, to do as I do. There is nothing wrong with the company asking not to have to meet this deduction. It is perfectly entitled to ask but it seems to me that the State is perfectly entitled to say "No".

This week, €500,000 from the town and village renewal scheme was granted in the Vote. What is the proposal from the OPW? Strictly speaking, that €500,000 is to reinstate the building, which has experienced deterioration in recent years. We heard in March that the old Garda station in Wexford may be repurposed. I thought the site was being sold. In respect of how we spend our money, many of these things seem like closing the door when the horse has bolted. Everything we spend afterwards costs twice as much because of the deterioration in the interim. Where are those two projects at? I think the fort may fall under the remit of Ms Collier.

Duncannon Fort is privately owned and in guardianship. It is, therefore, in the care of the OPW.

There are a number of such arrangements. They are largely unmanned sites that are inaccessible to the public. They are usually in the centre of somebody's farm holding or private lands. They are sufficiently important from a national and international perspective as a piece of our national heritage and, under legislation, are afforded the protection of national monument status.

How does it arise that we have a newly built, state-of-the-art Garda station that is not big enough, three years after its completion? How did that happen? It is being reported in Wexford that an extension is required to a building that is approximately four times as big as the building that was previously in use. Three years later, an extension is required.

I am trying to get to the bottom of whether the OPW is actively engaged. Every person in this room who represents a constituency could point to the construction or purchase of buildings that have been flooded. I am trying to understand the interaction of the OPW - the agency responsible - in this regard.

Obviously, there have been massive levels of construction inflation. Considering the cost of concrete, I am of the view that 20% is going to be a conservative figure in the long term. Are we building 20% fewer flood defences or will we increase the €1.3 billion figure by 20%?

I am not sure if a date has been set for the review of the plan. For the moment, we are working within that envelope. It is not having an impact; we are drawing down earlier from that envelope because of inflation and as schemes go forward. That will have to be taken into account, and not that alone as the much bigger issue for us is the whole wider issue of adapting to climate change and what additional investment will be needed due to sea level rise.

I get the impression, not just from the witnesses but also from others who have been before us, that there is a culture of fear in the public service, and that this is known by people who do business. It is almost like a reverse socialism. There is a fearlessness among those people. We see it, for example, in the context of the children's hospital with the number of claims being made. We are also seeing it with regard to the Convention Centre Dublin. The convention centre paid more out than €40 million in dividends in 2020 and 2021. The figures were €31 million in 2020 and €8 million in 2021. There was an impairment with regard to the accounts in 2021, and yet bonuses were paid. The OPW has stated it does not have a direct involvement in that. Why is that not all considered in a very robust way when the OPW is dealing with matters such as this? Because I have so little time, I want to return to the issue of Military Road and An Garda Síochána. Mr. Buckley made reference to 600 personnel. That is a very different figure to the one we were given previously. In 2016, the OPW was informed that the capacity was greater than 1,000. The actual figure was 1,090. The number of gardaí we are talking about matters in the context of the accommodation requirements. There are arguments that the open-plan design at Military Road is not ideal for some of the very sensitive matters with which gardaí will be dealing in that building. I will leave that aside, however. In addition to the Military Road build, there are also: Clyde House; the traffic centre at Heuston Station; the annual lease on the Phoenix House at Conyngham Road; the capital costs of the Phoenix Park building; and the Navan Road. Even though there is no building at the Navan Road site, we cannot bring people from a divisional station to somewhere else without a cost. It seems that by reducing the number to 600, which is a different number from the one we were dealing with, it minimises the cost of the move from the Harcourt Square building. It does not improve our carbon footprint to be levelling a building and replacing it. In fact, it is the reverse. I would be concerned about the culture of seeing this as a positive. I want a list of the actual costs of all of these buildings. I want go back to the figure given in 2016 of 1,090 gardaí and I want to know how they will be accommodated.

I explained that the Military Road premises, now Walter Scott House, was designed for 880 staff, which was the projection at that time for what was needed. A budget of €86 million was allocated to the Department of Justice and the project was initiated. The project has now been delivered, on time and on budget. The number of gardaí has grown in the meantime, which is a positive thing, to something in the region of 1,400 as opposed to 800.

First, there is the Military Road project to replace the planned figures given to us at the project brief, and which has been done, and, second, there is the expansion in Garda numbers. We have had to accommodate the latter at very short notice, and we have done that. Crime has developed and there are new forms of economic crime are involved.

If there is any particular point she wants to check, I am sure we can get the figure for her very quickly.

The figures given previously need to be checked when that table is being given because in the case of Military Road the figure keeps moving and reducing. It is causing confusion more than anything else. I want to know the totality of the cost of accommodation and whether the building is deemed to be absolutely safe. Some security modifications were also made to the building. I presume that cost was included in the final cost.

The building is built as it was signed off by the Garda Síochána three years ago.

I will ask about the value-for-money report, which dealt with a number of properties and the issue of whether to buy or lease. It was an interesting report which came out about eight weeks ago. I read it at the time. It made the point that leasing makes sense in the short and medium term. We cannot go out and buy hundreds of buildings tomorrow morning because the pounds, shillings and pence are not there. The upfront cost is an issue. However, where a Department or Government body needs a building for more than 20 years, the option of building or buying needs to be seriously considered. Will Mr. Buckley respond to that? The report found that the savings in some cases could be as much as 39%. The review found that a saving of €216 million for the State could potentially be achieved across just five buildings if they were built or bought as opposed to being leased. The OPW has obviously studied the report. Does it have plans to try to incrementally increase the number of buildings which are bought or owned as opposed to long-term leasing?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	691	We were a major party to the writing of that report so it is very important information, which we are following through on in every way we can. I will bring in Mr. Bourke who, along with Mr. Pat Fitzsimons, was very central to this work.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	692	We were the main authors of the report with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It probably came as no surprise, as the Chair has said, that once a period of 20 years has passed, there is profit in an owned building whereas in a leased building, if you were to cut and run after 20 years, there is no asset left and the holder is just walking away from a lease. What we always try to do in the estate and the overall portfolio is have an appropriate balance between owned and leased buildings. Commentators sometimes say that everything should be owned but we would not hold with that and nor would most jurisdictions would. A balance is needed so that you can scale up or down depending on what is happening at the time. For instance, at the time of the rationalisation in 2008 and 2009, we rationalised out of many leased properties.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	693	I understand that and saw it in the briefing note but what I am referring to here is that across five buildings, the potential saving could have been €216 million. I know Mr. Bourke was involved in writing the report with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report stated that in just one of those buildings, we will spend €102 million more to rent it than if we purchased a similar sized building for €63 million, which is a saving of 38%. I understand contracts are signed and the OPW cannot walk away from them at the drop of a hat. It is grand having reports and this is a wonderful country altogether for doing reports - we could fill Leinster House with them - but in terms of action on the back of these reports, what is now being done?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	694	Very specifically, when funding is available and there is a demand for accommodation, we will actively consider either building or building if the timescale allows for it. Building is the preference. At the moment, we have two major building projects ongoing. One is Tom Johnson House, which is a major retrofit refurbishment, and the second is a complete new build in Leeson Lane. Both of those will take pressure off the leased buildings.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	696	Yes, it is a point of policy that the Minister of State would regularly run past us and how we can go about getting to a situation where we are in a position to build more often. Buying is very difficult in the public sector because of the large lump sum expenditure involved in a single purchase and it is not profiled. Much of it has to do with forecasting numbers and demand. This report is going to sharpen this debate, as the Chair correctly said.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	697	From the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts, if we can buy, as Mr. Buckley correctly pointed out, we have an asset. It is the same with housing. I know we cannot go out and do it tomorrow morning at the drop of a hat. I understand that but we can see that most of these Departments and bodies are not going away. They will be needed long after we are no longer around.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	698	No, and we can interleave that with the current work of the office of the future and the impact remote working will have on the estate. We have asked all Departments to come back with advice on what they can do to reduce their space requirement. We may have the opportunity of releasing some leased buildings or of disposing of some energy inefficient owned buildings. We will have the opportunity in the next while to readdress that balance somewhat.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	699	I do not want to take up more time but I have a few questions I want to ask Mr. O'Connor about the Garda station in Portlaoise and the UN veterans' part of that. I thank the OPW for getting back to me on the issue. I will ask my questions after the meeting. On parklands and so forth, we are lucky in County Laois to have Heywood Gardens and Emo Court. The staff and management deserve top marks for looking after those. They are great facilities. I have an interest in the biodiversity in these sites. Deputy Hourigan has left has an interest in this too. Money is being spent clearing out the forest floors and much of the natural vegetation in these sites, which butchers habitats and causes a loss of biodiversity and wildlife. These are hugely important amenities and carbon sinks. Who is giving the directions to bulldoze the forest floors in some of those sites? Is the person responsible present? I am saying this as somebody who uses these sites. This is not sought by members of the public who enjoy the wildlife. This was not getting in the way of anyone walking around. There was no safety issues because these are areas on which people do not walk. For some reason, people see that whole areas have been cleared out. Can any of the witnesses or those present in the Public Gallery tell me who is giving the direction to do this or making the decision?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	700	I can probably answer that. The bulk of the woodlands around Emo Court are in the ownership of Coillte. We have no ownership over the bulk of the walking ground on the outer rim of the estate.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	701	I am talking about the OPW's part of the land, including in Heywood Gardens.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	702	I just wanted to clarify that. We have an expert parks team who specialise in looking after historic design landscapes. There is a scheme for managing those sites throughout the seasons. Grasslands are allowed to grow very long during the summertime and we have a whole approach to managing biodiversity at those sites. I assure the Chair of that.There is a practice in the autumn to deal with cases of fallen debris and doing clear-ups in the woodlands during the winter. That allows for type of regrowth and habitat management in the spring and summer seasons. That is a kind of cycle at work.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	703	We are in a biodiversity crisis. It has been declared. There is also a cost involved. I preface this by complimenting the staff for managing both of those facilities. They are wonderful. We are blessed with them. I do not want to go into a whole debate on this but I ask the witnesses to go back and look at this again because one part of the Government does not seem to be telling the other part what it is doing. The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is saying this has to be sorted out. Most people have accepted that we have to address the biodiversity crisis. These are carbon sinks. They are huge habitats and they manage themselves. We do not need to be going in with machinery and ploughing up the whole place.

There is a cost involved. The environmental cost is the biggest cost. These are important habitats and important carbon sinks. It is important that we preserve them. I would give the OPW ten out of ten for all the good work that has been done there. I do not want to just focus on that. I acknowledge that these sites are kept spectacularly. That is the only word I can use. I will allow Deputies back in if they have a final question.

How much capital has the OPW surrendered to the Exchequer in 2021 and 2022?

That primarily reflects the issues we spoke about before on the flood risk side with the immense challenge of driving through large environmentally sensitive projects in river basins in different areas.

How we are responding to that is by ramping up, in a major way, the number of schemes we are putting into the system, designing and getting started. A couple of years ago there would have been 30 schemes running in parallel.

As I said, we have greatly increased and are running at capacity internally. More of a constraint is the capacity in the market in Ireland of expert environmentalists and designers to develop these schemes. We have ramped up, to the greatest extent possible, with a view to recovering in later years the shortfall in these years so we will get the total spent back on track. We are also-----

It has been allocated to the Department and not been spent. That is concerning.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	733	It is one of the issues with annual accounting. It is very hard to budget for large capital projects like this with five or six years' duration except in a multi-annual accounting environment. In fairness, the Government is trying to move more and more to that model. As it is at the moment, we must manage as best we can within that programme. We are very concerned about the underspend. We are trying to address the issues involved. We are engaging more and earlier with environmental groups to try to stave off judicial reviews and other issues that cause us huge delays. Getting past the planning stage is the single biggest challenge for us at the moment. We take some of that on our own shoulders. We believe we are very environmentally conscious in how we approach flood risk management. We need to increase that. We need to improve our communication. We need to get involved earlier. We are doing all of these things. To answer the Deputy's earlier question, in 2022 we have applied for a carry-forward of 10% into 2023. There may be a small return over and above that but we will not know until the final account is done at the end of the month.

The OPW has not taken a view. The OPW is going through a due diligence process that is warranted in this case. I know it is warranted in this case and so we have not taken a view. What we are doing is listening to other views. We will have to take an overall decision on this because at the end of the day the contract has been-----

There is a different culture with that treatment.

In a previous career I worked in the social welfare environment. Even though it is a much lesser scale of money, there must be very considerable due diligence before something is called an overpayment and somebody is hauled to court or had deductions as a result.

There is no question of that arising, I understand, in this case. There is actually a dispute resolution clause in the contract if we formally go into dispute. As commercial operators on their side and as commercially minded people on my side, we have to give it due diligence, particularly in the context of a Government policy that stopped international travel, etc. In the history of the world, this has never happened. It deserves a month or two to consider it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	757	The storm of 2017 and the impact of that event produced new information about the hydrology of the catchments there - the Owenass and Pound catchments. That had to be investigated and it necessitated the design of a new bridge there as well. It completely changed the design from what had been proposed under CFRAM. It is predominantly down to those issues of the complex hydrology.

It is at the foot of the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The council has done good work each year. I ask Mr Casey to keep in contact with the council and keep all the channels open in terms of the Pound river, the Owenass and all the other tributaries there. It is a fine balance regarding what can happen. In particular, the houses on Manor Road have been close to flooding on a number of occasions. It is important that the work be done. The last big flood was in 2017 and work is not due to be complete until January 2027, which is ten years later. It is a long time. I know that some of the different stages cannot be overlapped. I ask Mr. Casey to come back to me if there is anything else that can be done to accelerate that. The cost for the Mountmellick project was just over €3 million.

The site at Mountrath Road, Portlaoise was bought for €1 million. It started off in the 2000s, we are now going into the third decade and we are still within the same situation where the best part of €1 million a year is being spent on renting offices in various places. Some of them are over pubs and in different unsuitable places. I accept that they are consolidated a bit more now. What is the status of the Mountrath Road site? We have a site that is owned and yet we are renting all these different locations around the town for the decentralisation. I accept this was not Mr Buckley's fault, but this was written on the back of an envelope or a cigarette box. It should have been planned better. We heard about this before the 2004 local elections and everybody thought it was wonderful but there seemed to have been no preparation for it. Where are we at now nearly 20 years later with the Mountrath Road site?

It is renting places such as Grattan House opposite Portlaoise Prison and Kilminchy.

The amount that would be paid on rent for those buildings as opposed to what we would pay in Dublin is considerably less. In actual fact, it is very good value.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	776	That was the argument for locating Departments there. As a public representative for the area and as Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am looking at this site that I drive past twice a day coming here and going home on the orbital route and there it is lying empty with bushes growing up around it. Meanwhile we are paying nearly €1 million a year renting various office complexes around the town to facilitate these buildings. I raised this with Brian Hayes back when he was Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW. This has been going on and on but nobody seems to have a handle on it. I have raised it frequently when representatives of the OPW have appeared before the committee. I accept that the OPW does not have full control over this. However, it is not a satisfactory situation. The OPW is charged with the government estate and here we are renting and leasing while this site is vacant. It is totally unsatisfactory. People are scratching their heads wondering why we cannot make better use of this site. In the years since 2002 or 2003, €15 million or €16 million may have been spent on rent. That €15 million or €16 million could have been spent on a greenfield site that is on an orbital route. It is not like the children's hospital and it is not necessary to get in and out by helicopter.It is an easy place to get into and out of. It is a good site. Okay, there are cables running over it and there is a relocation issue there with the ESB - I am aware of that - but surely, in terms of value for money, this should have been sorted out before now. Heads need to be knocked together. There is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well. I know that Ms Mulvihill will not be able to answer the question, but perhaps she could take it back to the Department. Where are we going that we continuously spend money on leases and rents when we have a site standing there? We did not even think of leasing it out to somebody for grazing and now there are bushes growing up around it. It is almost overgrown now.

What I can say to you is that, in conjunction with the works Mr. O'Connor explained about the new Garda station and the extension to the Garda station, there is an interim proposal being examined at the moment regarding using that site or part of it as part of the decant phase when there is work being done on the Garda station.

It would not be a responsible thing to push a button on spending maybe €70 million or €80 million on office space for clients to turn around and say they do not need it because of blended working. We are at that analysis stage. All Departments are working with us on this and we just have to tread carefully in order that we do not commit to something-----

It is not satisfactory that a site could be bought and just left standing there with no use made of it in the intervening nearly 20 years now. Can Mr. Buckley see where I am coming from?

I ask the OPW to come back with some definite information. As for that site, the OPW would want to use it or lose it. It will have to do something. It is not satisfactory that it is just left there vacant like that. I ask that the OPW come back within the next couple of weeks with a report on what exactly is happening with the site and whether it will be used. I did hear some information about the Garda-----

I thank the committee and the staff of the OPW and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the work involved in today's meeting. I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for attending and assisting. Is it agreed that the clerk seek any follow-up information and that we carry out any actions arising from the meeting? Agreed. I know there were a lot of questions. You wanted to come in briefly, Mr. Buckley.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	787	If I may, and if you will indulge me, Chairman. I am conscious of the fact that this is the last Committee of Public Accounts debate of the year and it is just before Christmas. I am also very conscious of the fact that one of the main audiences for this will be the OPW staff. We have 2,500 staff and many of them will look back at this video and debate. The work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts is fabulous and a very important part of our constitutional democracy. They certainly keep people like me, Accounting Officers, on our toes. There is not one of us who is not uncomfortable coming in here knowing that each Deputy, in his or her own inimitable way, will question, query and probe. We are really dragged over the coals. That is fine and correct at my level and the level of other Accounting Officers. Of course, the media will then pick up on anything that is a bad headline.

The Deputies reflect the public. We are elected by our peers. The public place huge value on some of the sites we mentioned, not only heritage sites but also public offices and so on. We are lucky in this State that we have an OPW that looks after all these facilities for us. On top of that, now it is landed with having to deal with the Ukrainian modular housing situation and the emerging flood risk situation. I know that is a challenging situation to deal with. I acknowledge that and I think it is acknowledged-----

I wish to take this opportunity to ask OPW staff to please do the reverse. You have just kindly referred to the work that has been done, Chairman. We need to redouble our work and nothing else. The consistent message all morning long has been the speed of delivery. The OPW has a reputation for tackling projects that others do not and addressing them, and we should continue that.

I know that giving the OPW that framework is a new departure. We did not just write down eight questions on a sheet of paper. Value for money is a hard thing to nail down. We went through a process of doing that. We had some external advice as well. I want the OPW to come back to the committee using that template of eight questions. I know it is new.

We will then go briefly into private session before adjourning until 19 January. The minutes of meetings on 1 December and 8 December have been circulated. Do any members wish to raise matters? Are the minutes agreed? Agreed. They will as usual be published on the committee's web page. We will move on to accounts and financial statements. Eight sets of accounts and financial statements were read before the Houses between 28 November and 9 December. I ask Mr. McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to address these before opening to the floor.

Agreed. The accounts and statements will be published as part of our minutes. We will move on to correspondence. As previously agreed, items that are not items of discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated and decisions taken by the committee on the correspondence will be recorded on the minutes of the committee's meetings and published on the web page. The first category which members have flagged is category B, that is, Accounting Officers and their Minister with regard to follow-up to committee meetings. The following items were held over from our meeting on 1 December: No. 1582B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 17 November, providing information requested by the committee with regard to landfill remediation in the purchase of additional temporary generation capacity. Deputy Carthy had flagged it but he was not present. His office has since advised that he does not wish to speak on it.

#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	807	While Deputy Murphy is preparing her notes, I have two points to make in respect of the briefing note circulated by the HSE. The first is on the contact with the individuals whose data had been exposed during the cyberattack in 2021. The HSE indicates that it has begun sending out letters to 113,000 individuals. It says that over the 16-week notifiable period, subjects will receive a letter from the HSE advising them that their data were part of the data breach. It indicates that they are invited to register through an online portal to speak to an agent or to log on to a request to view the relevant data. My concern in this regard is that these are people whose files obviously were in the hands of the HSE and as there will be varying degrees to which the information was sensitive or of concern, I believe there is a need to be proactive in particular instances. One would be where the data which were exposed were of an extremely sensitive nature and the second would where the individuals involved may not have easy access to being able to log on to an online portal. It would be important for the HSE to be proactive in both those instances and it would be worth corresponding with the executive to ask how it plans to deal with those two specific types of issues. If you receive a letter which indicates that your data have been exposed without having any idea as to what the level of exposure was or how sensitive that information might have been; there is a chance that you may not go onto the portal. One may also be dealing with people who have moderate disabilities and who might not be in position to access the written correspondence and follow up accordingly. The second part of the correspondence where I seek further clarification is point 9 in the correspondence. This relates to the provision of ICU beds. It indicates there is a plan in place to increase the number of ICU beds from 255, as was the case in December 2020, to the 446, which were committed to at that point. The letter indicates that the HSE has now reached 323 beds, which is still a fair distance away from the target. It also states that the number of beds open on a given day varies depending on staffing and other operational issues. It would be useful to get further clarification and perhaps a tabular breakdown as to the actual number of ICU beds that have been available on a daily and weekly basis, have been used by patients, and were available for their use in order that we can get a clearer picture in respect of the implementation of that particular plan.

One issue that arose during the year was the number of funded posts and the level of recruitment that happened against that. It fell considerably short of the number of posts which were funded. Point 10 is a case in point and is one which I raised with the HSE. This had to do with bereavement support and social workers for families in St. Brigid’s Hospice, Kildare and a chaplaincy post, which for people who are religious is quite central and an important post. This seems to have been going on for quite a long time and when one talks about bereavement and social workers, for example, where there are children involved, there is a price to pay for not having that kind of expertise there at the right time to support families. These are important posts but I cannot believe that we are still talking about these positions being on panels and where these staff members have not been recruited yet. I would like to be kept informed of those positions.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	812	We will ask the HSE specifically in respect of that matter and in respect of the issue raised by Deputy Carthy. Moving on to point 8, and the vacant properties in Laois and Offaly, I note the replies sent back from the HSE in this correspondence in respect of the Portarlington Primary Care Centre are different to the replies that were given to a colleague in response to a recent parliamentary question. I ask that we seek clarification from the HSE in respect of the Newtown facility, where it is saying that it is not fit for the delivery of temporary health care and that discussions are ongoing with the local authorities. I ask that we get an update on that. Portarlington Primary Care Centre relates to the correspondence where there was a different answer and where it states that the centre is under active consideration for future healthcare use. In the reply to a parliamentary question last week, or within the past ten days, it said otherwise. I ask that we seek clarification on these points. I also seek clarification on the Erril health centre. These are the three matters I wish to raise out of the approximately ten in total. On the Erril one, it is stated that it is under practical consideration for healthcare use. I ask the HSE to give details of that and on the timelines for the refurbishment of those buildings because they have been lying empty for years. I have certainly received complaints about one of those buildings, in particular, from the local Tidy Towns committee. They cannot be left empty indefinitely because the longer the building is left vacant, the more it deteriorates. I am asking for a timeline from HSE estates in respect of that and to clarify the uses of these buildings.  Moving onto No. 1605, this correspondence is from Darragh O'Loughlin, CEO of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, dated 28 November. This provides the information which was requested by the committee arising from the meeting with Horse Racing Ireland and representatives from the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board on 22 September. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Carthy flagged this item. Does he wish to comment on it?
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	813	Yes, point 1 deals with our query in respect of an exit package to the former CEO of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board. Almost throughout the tenure of that CEO, there were quite regular discussions on how his salary was kept confidential. It was one of the few heads of statutory boards for which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had allowed the salary package to be kept confidential and it was never disclosed. There was quite a good deal of controversy around that matter, so much so that the IHRB ensured that the salary of the new CEO is publicly available, which is only correct. It beggars belief that in that context, the IHRB then agreed to an exit package on a confidential basis and subjected both parties, we are told, to a legally binding non-disclosure agreement. This is not the correct way to do business and I suggest in the first instance that we inquire whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform agreed to this process being confidential and if so, why? I also suggest we contact the IHRB to clarify who sought that this provision would be confidential and legally binding as a non-disclosure agreement. I welcome a number of details in respect of the CCTV installation at racetracks. That is an issue which this committee has raised on a number of occasions. Horse Racing Ireland tells us that it has installed CCTV at six tracks, that these facilities will be installed at 20 tracks by the end of the year, and that the remainder will be installed by the first quarter of next year.I ask the secretariat to ensure we follow up early in the new year to ensure the 20 tracks have been completed and that we are on course to all of them having CCTV installed by the end of quarter 1 of 2023. In respect of the confirmation that CCTV has been installed across six tracks, the discussions that have been raised were specific to stableyards. It would be useful to have confirmation that the site figures relate to the stableyards within those sites and within the other tracks in which CCTV is due to be installed. We might also ask for a briefing note on who will have access to the CCTV footage, who can request access and in which circumstances it can be accessed by those authorities that have provision to do so.

No. 1607B is from Ms Carol Boate, regulator of the national lottery, dated 30 November, providing information requested by the committee on the number of people who commenced a self-exclusion in 2020 and 2021. This was raised at our recent meeting. It is proposed to query why the breakdown of self-exclusionary periods by length is not available and to note and publish the correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Carthy and I flagged this matter for discussion. It is important to know why that detail is not available. The regulator sets out in the letter that 1,465 accounts commenced during 2020 but there were 1,515 exclusions during that year. There is a consistent pattern in 2021, with 1,302 accounts commenced and, again, a slightly larger number of exclusions, at 1,339, during that period. The answers given in the letter do not give us the full picture. We will request further information.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	815	A number of members acknowledged last week when we were dealing with the national lottery representatives that there was not an obligation on them to be here but that, nevertheless, some of their answers were very unsatisfactory. In response to a number of instances where information was sought, they indicated that the information had been provided to the regulator and would not be provided to anyone else. A number of Deputies were eager for the regulator to be invited back before the committee. We should confirm for the secretariat's benefit that we will pursue that early in the new year. I put a set of questions to the national lottery representatives in respect of online players,the protections for those who might be spending a lot and the flagging system that is in place in that regard. Mr. Algeo indicated there was a provision in place whereby people would receive online messages, followed by telephone calls, followed potentially by a series of measures the national lottery can take up to excluding or removing a player from being able to purchase online tickets. He refused to outline the number of instances of each, indicating that this information had been supplied to the regulator. I request, in the first instance, that we write to the regulator seeking those figures in respect of online players, including the number who received the flagging messages Mr. Algeo mentioned, the number who received follow-on telephone calls and the number who were excluded from playing online games as a result of the national lottery's player welfare management process.

Mr. Algeo could not tell us. We might ask the regulator whether there is an obligation for a minimum spend and, if so, what that figure is. Another point is that the regulator said there was a breach. When we asked Mr. Algeo if there were other breaches, he refused to answer other than to say information had been forwarded to the regulator. We need to ascertain whether the regulator is dealing with a number of breaches.

In addition, in the course of our deliberations, the national lottery representatives indicated that the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, ASAI, had contacted the national lottery to clarify information that emanated from our discussions with the regulator. I do not know whether that matter has been followed up since then. It was indicated that as of last week, the ASAI had not contacted this committee, which seems a bizarre way of doing business on its part. It would be helpful to get clarification as to whether the committee has since contacted the ASAI. If not, we should do so. We should also bring to its attention the acknowledgement by the witnesses from the national lottery last week that 90% of money that goes back into the community under its provision includes unclaimed prized money that is diverted towards advertising for the product itself. We should ask whether the ASAI has any intention of reviewing its previous decision on that advertising claim.

It is one of the most bizarre issues that has come to my attention on the part of a State body.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	822	The terms of the licence certainly seem to leave a lot to be desired. The problem is the operator not being accountable to the committee. The regulator is accountable, however, and that is the route we will take with it. We will follow up on that. The next correspondence is No. 1613B from Mr. Ciarán Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, dated 6 December 2022, providing information requested by the committee on third-party costs in respect of tribunals and commissions of investigations since 1997. No. 1617B is related. It is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 8 December 2022, providing information requested by the committee on the overall cost since 1997 of tribunals and commissions of investigation. It is proposed to note and publish both items of correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. The figures are hair-raising. We are looking at almost €525 million between tribunals, investigations and inquiries. At this stage, we should ask the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform what work is being done on finding other ways of carrying out these inquiries, tribunals and investigations. The Mahon tribunal alone cost €142 million. It is mind-blowing that the public must pay such amounts to unearth the truth. The Department of the Taoiseach ultimately oversees these matters but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must also have some role in looking at other options, considering whether should there be an anti-corruption office or agency and looking at best practice internationally.I propose that we request that information from the Secretaries General of both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	823	I have specific point to make before I comment on a similar point to the one the Chair has raised. The Olympic ticketing issue seems like a small one for the commission of investigation to investigate. I suggest that we ask for a full schedule of that, because I would like to look at it in slightly more detail. On the question of how we do business in this country, other jurisdictions have taken a different approach. The Social Democrats looked at an example in Australia. We proposed an anti-corruption agency on foot of that where there would be the prospect of a permanent office of investigation. After an inquiry is held, we lose the kind of information that would inform our consideration of the question of whether we would do it differently if we were to start it again. The ides of having a permanent office of investigation is about retaining that kind of institutional memory. It looks to us like that worked well in the example that we used from Australia. There are other examples from around the world that are worth looking at. It is a huge amount of money. Sometimes there is a degree of penny-pinching done in regulation in this country. I refer to issues like mica and the regulation of quarries. We pay for this anyway, but we tend to pay it in retrospect and then it appears to be a scandal. This is opposed to the predict-and-prevent approach, which you have to put money into but is a better way for the State to function. There are good examples in other jurisdictions of how they regulate various aspects of public life, including when it comes to planning.  We have not had many tribunals of inquiry. The most recent one was the inquiry into the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation's first and only transaction, which was the sale of Siteserv. The approach taken in that case - it was done behind closed doors because of the bespoke legislation - did not end up reducing the number of legal people who were involved. It ended up not really being equivalent to an inquiry under the 2004 Act, which sought to reduce the level of legal involvement. I am not sure that this is the forum in which this will happen, but I think this committee may well have a view on it. We could write to the Taoiseach about the importance of looking at this issue collectively, learning from the past and putting systems in place. If we put good, robust systems in place, we will reduce the need for inquiries. In addition, when inquiries happen, they should happen in a way that is cost-effective and timely. When they go on for years, it is a huge frustration. Very often, there is a feeling that people are not held to account by virtue of the fact that it is a tribunal. In some cases, a corruption issue should be dealt with in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, or the corporate enforcement agency we are hearing about now. That was supposed to be in place last January. This is just a case in point. That was supposed to be fully in place, with all of the gardaí in place, last January, but they are still recruiting for the gardaí at the end of the year. That kind of thing is gigantically frustrating. It shows the difference between how we treat white-collar crime and how we deal with crimes of other natures.

There are bills of €68 million and €142 million and sometimes there are very few positive outcomes. In the first instance, we should write to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ask them, in view of the fact that we are looking at almost €525 million across all of these investigations and inquiries, if they are actively examining other options, if they are looking at international best practice and if they are considering a better way of doing this in the form of a permanent office or agency or some other means. There may be a better approach out there that we do not know about. We cannot let a situation like this continue. As the Deputy correctly said, at the end of it, after a very long period of time, the public sees a large bill. That is it and we move on. I think we have to break that cycle.

I thank the Deputy. No. 1615 is from David Moloney, who is the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is dated 6 December and it provides information that was requested by the committee regarding the status of the business case for the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital. I propose to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Catherine Murphy has flagged this.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	2021 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	827	We have to remember that quite a sizeable amount of money has been spent on facilities there in advance of the hospital breaking ground. We were also told that we need to learn lessons from previous or current developments, but we have only been looking at the national children's hospital. It would be very difficult to learn lessons from that because I do not know how long it will be before we have its final costings and how that will play out. One thing is certain: you need to have a very good business case and to nail down every screw and piece of wiring that goes into it in advance. The tighter that is, the more you can determine the final cost of such a building. PwC was hired by the Department of Health to conduct the external assurance process and it recommended that the business case documentation be updated. It would be useful for us to know what shortcomings PwC found because that is the kind of thing we need to understand. We might, therefore, ask the Department of Health for information on the shortcomings that were found. The committee needs to be kept in the loop in relation to the various stages that this is at. The business case, the work that is done by the quantity surveyors and the design, etc., will be important. I have a real issue with where it has been located, but let us park that. At the very least, we need to be assured that we will not walk ourselves into the same situation that we now find ourselves in with the national children’s hospital.

We will follow up on that. No. 1621 is from Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE. It is dated 12 December and it provides information that was requested by the committee arising from its consideration of a report entitled Funding and Deficit Challenges in Voluntary Disability Services Agencies. Members will recall that this concerns section 38 and 39 organisations, which we discussed recently. The correspondence was received late but was circulated yesterday. It is a detailed response.

We will hold it over until January. The next category of correspondence relates to private individuals, and any other correspondence. There are three items we are waiting to hand over from the previous meeting and if we can, I would like us to deal with them today. They have been held over already twice. One is No. 1574 from Deputy Hourigan, dated 11 November, and No. 1577 from Deputy Carroll Mac Neill, dated 15 November, both of which have been held over since 24 November. We also have a related piece of correspondence from Deputy Carthy, dated 24 November. The items concern the Charities Regulator and the alleged operation of a body that is not registered as such. I understand that the same matter was raised at a matter of the previous Committee of Public Accounts in 2019. A reference is made to that in the correspondence. I ask Members to bear in mind the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. At our meeting on 24 November we agreed to request the Charities Regulator to respond to the matters raised. I will open the meeting to the floor. Does Deputy Catherine Murphy or Deputy Carthy wish to speak?

To give them their due, could we include it as an item of correspondence as well at the first meeting in January, regardless of whether we have received a response from the Charities Regulator?

If that turns out to be the case, we could ask for the transcript of the meetings. We will await that information. If the committee agrees, we can follow up on it at that point.

It will be going in the next couple of days. It will definitely go this week. Is that okay?

We were hoping that this would come up again today and we could deal with it. We will send the request to the Charities Regulator for its response and then we will deal with it fully at that stage. We will move on to No. 1584. It has been held over as well. It is from an individual and is dated 19 November. It is a press statement regarding Horse Sport Ireland and the role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Deputy Carthy flagged this.

With your indulgence, Chair, could I put this matter back until January, just to get my notes together properly?

Yes, Deputy Carthy can firm up on that and we can deal with it. The next item is No. 1619 from Deputy Catherine Murphy. It is dated 9 December. It is proposed to request information from RTÉ, including a business case, regarding expenditure on a musical production. Does the Deputy want to explain what this is about?

It is possibly a spin-off from the toy show, but it is in the convention centre. I want to see innovation from RTÉ, and it is a departure, which I hope is successful. I think there was a spin-off in regard to Riverdance as well, but it would be quite useful to see this in terms of the prospect of income from it, so we might just ask RTÉ.

That completes the discussion of correspondence We will move on then to the work programme. At the meeting of 1 December, we agreed our work programme for the new year, as follows. I know it is a bit away now, but it is hard to have it our heads. The first meeting of the new year is scheduled for 19 January. That is with the Housing Agency and the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority. That is to examine chapter 7 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2021 report on the Housing Agency's revolving acquisition fund. We will also examine the financial statements of both bodies. I understand that the 2021 financial statements for the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority have been laid and the Department is working to ensure that the Housing Agency's 2021 financial statements are also laid and available to examine before the meeting. On 26 January, we will then engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to examine its appropriation account and two chapters of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2021 report. With the committee's agreement, we will also add chapter 7 on the Housing Agency's revolving acquisition fund. Members will recall that we had a brief discussion around this some months ago. It is open to us to discuss any matter arising from the previous engagement. Is that agreed? Agreed. We are deliberately doing it one week after the other to ensure we will have a better meeting given the fact that there is a follow-up meeting on the same subject. On 2 February, we will engage with the HSE, to resume examination of its financial statements, with a focus on expenditure on disability services, including the provision of disability services by outside agencies, emergency care, and measures to tackle waiting lists. Further engagements, including with the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and An Bord Pleanála, are set out in the work programme circulated to members. I should also mention that the Comptroller and Auditor General has completed a report on emergency procurement of ventilators by the HSE. I understand the report was submitted to the Minister for Health on 7 December and he is required to present the report to the Dáil within three months of that date, at which point it will be available for the committee to examine. Does any Member wish to raise any matter in regard to the work programme? All are happy. That concludes consideration of the work programme. The final item on the public agenda for today is any other business. Does any member wish to raise any other business? No. We will now move into private session briefly before adjourning until the new year on 19 January.
