            <p eId="para_16">In the context of the pressing problems arising as a result of climate change, this matter relates to giving leadership within local communities. We need to get the message across that we all can contribute to reversing the damage caused by the burning of fossil fuels, etc. We can do so by retrofitting primary schools and installing solar panels in order that they can produce electricity, not only for their own consumption but also for that of the wider community. We need to work hard on this because retrofitting has not been incorporated into the planning permissions granted in respect of some new primary and secondary schools in the past two years. Doing what I suggest would show that leadership is being given at national level and in local communities.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnHalligan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy John Halligan)<recordedTime time="2019-06-11T14:35:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">On behalf of the Minister, Deputy McHugh, I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue, which gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department's plans for upgrading older schools. As he is aware, the Department will be investing €8.4 billion in school buildings over the lifetime of Project Ireland 2040. The latter will give rise to a 70% increase in the school building budget and this will be targeted at delivering the twin objectives of catering for the continued increase in demographics and a greater focus on refurbishment and upgrade of existing school stock. The Governnent remains committed to delivering existing projects under the schools building programme as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> Project Ireland 2040 provides the investment necessary to implement the commitments in the Action Plan for Education to reform and modernise the school curriculum by committing to a physical education, PE, hall build and modernisation programme, starting in the second half of the Project Ireland 2040 period, which will ensure that students in all post-primary schools will have access to state-of-the-art PE facilities. This will be particularly apt in the context of the roll-out of PE as a leaving certificate subject. The next phase of the summer works scheme, which is currently open for applications, will facilitate a school laboratory modernisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> The Department of Education and Skills has been at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings since the development of its energy research programme in 1997. Since 2017, it has partnered with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in an energy-efficient retrofit pilot scheme for schools. This programme is focusing on medium to deep retrofit measures, including fabric, electrical and mechanical upgrades, to improve the energy efficiency of existing schools. The longer-term outcome of the pilot will be to create an accurate and scaleable model for energy-efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> In the national development plan, €2.5 billion is identified for the refurbishment and construction of schools. Part of this is an intention to undertake a deep energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">This pilot scheme will pave the way for and inform a much larger national schools' energy retrofit programme based on the range of topical retrofit options that will have been tried and tested during the scheme. Some 16 schools have received energy retrofits under the programme to date. The total expenditure involved was approximately €7 million. For 2019, proposed works for 17 schools are being progressed through tender and contract award stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> The Department's technical guidance documents, TGDs, set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the TGDs must achieve an A3 building energy rating. Results show that new schools being built to the 2017 building regulations have A3 building energy ratings and are also - as has been assessed - up to 20% more efficient than required under the existing regulations. All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeated results are then incorporated into the new school designs and refurbishments. In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to schools' needs and are not just applied for the sake of attaching "renewable" tag to those schools. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable applications. That is reasonable. This has been assisted in previous years by means of the wall and attic insulation and the water conservation programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> The Department of Education and Skills has been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools for the past 17 years. More than 40% of the research programme features renewable aspects. All new schools built in accordance with the current building regulations have a minimum of 10% of their energy supplied by photovoltaic, PV, panels and are future proofed to take advantage of developing technologies as they become available. While it is not a planning requirement, major refurbishment projects facilitate the provision of PV installations to meet a base-load requirement - this is the maximum electrical load of the school used outside school hours - to optimise the performance of the system. In the context of projects that will be carried out under the 2020 summer works scheme and that will involve electrical upgrades, PV panels will be provided in order that the base-load requirements can be met and the performance of the system optimised. The potential for the use of renewables in schools is under continued review by the research programmes of the Department's energy research programme through continued research and by monitoring improvements in technology and the marketplace.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. He referred to the past 17 years in the context of this programme. Should we not take a more aggressive approach to school renewal projects by using all available resources in order to ensure that there is energy saving, that value for money is secured and that oil and other fossil fuels will not be burned unnecessarily in order to provide heating. Have we adopted an approach that is sufficiently aggressive? The Government should be providing leadership in local communities by showing that this can be done with school premises. People would then learn that they can do it in their houses. We need to get that message across. We need to work far harder on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">I agree with the Senator. With the TGDs as a benchmark and with the energy efficiency retrofit pilot scheme already well under way, the Department has demonstrated its commitment to achieving greater energy efficiency. The pilot scheme has already cleared a path for the wider retrofit programme, funded under the national development plan, to follow.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">That, in itself, has sent out a message to other schools and the wider public that the Department is determined to do what we set out to do in the 2040 programme. Schools currently being built to the 2017 building regulations have already an A3 energy rating. It is good to see that they are 20% more efficient than required. That is a clear message that is being sent out, including to the Government and future Governments, that it works. The pilot scheme is very effective and is being noticed by other schools and the general public.</p>

            <from>Senator Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2019-06-11T14:45:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_27">The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, is very welcome to the Seanad Chamber. I thank him for responding to this very important item. Newtownwhite national school is a rural school situated between Killala and Ballina and was in decline until September 2012 when under the patronage divestment process the patronage transferred from the Church of Ireland to Educate Together. It is safe to say that since then the school has gone from strength to strength. Next September the school will increase from 54 pupils this year to 60, which will allow it to have a third teacher. I commend the Church of Ireland authorities, the local bishop, the school community and in particular the staff and board of management for their great work. All of that is in spite of the fact that the school accommodation is poor. The school is old and its accommodation is substandard to the modern day needs we envisage pupils should enjoy. One can imagine their joy when they got the news six weeks ago that they will get new accommodation comprising two mainstream classrooms and a special education room. That will enhance their offering and free up existing classrooms which can be put to other use such as for storage and a PE hall.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> That is good news. However, there is a problem which has been ongoing for years. At the time of the divestment the property was in the name of the Church of Ireland and, as I understand it, a lease must be drawn up between the Church of Ireland and the Department of Education and Skills to regularise the situation. The school cannot act on foot of the notification from the Department to provide additional accommodation. The Church of Ireland authorities have been waiting for years to get the lease sorted out and they are not happy for the project to continue without the lease being sorted. That is only as a last resort and I hope we will make progress and get some answers today.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> I have been communicating with the office of the Minister, Deputy McHugh, and his predecessors for some time, inquiring about the reason the lease, which is a basic thing, has not been drawn up. What are the delays and obstacles? The school has no clear answers. I should also add that the school is on a constrained site but is has an offer of land immediately adjoining the school to expand it. The school community is not going to buy land when the title of the land it is on is not even sorted out. We all understand that is a basic requirement for the school to be able to continue and to grow. I would like some answers today and beyond that it would be a welcome relief to the staff, school community and parents if we could see some progress as they want their new accommodation to be built.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">Senator Mulherin may be happy with the answer I will give her today. I thank her for raising the matter. As she may be aware, the Newtownwhite Educate Together national school opened in September 2014 under the patronage divestment process. The process is one of a number of steps taken by the Department of Education and Skills to provide a more diverse range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">Under this process, following surveys undertaken in 2012 and 2013, it was envisaged that existing school patrons would make buildings surplus to requirement available for greater diversity if sufficient demand for a school under different patronage could be demonstrated. Some 11 new multi-denominational schools have been established under the process, with another due to be established in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> As the Senator will be aware, the patronage of schools often involves ownership of schools and school properties. The ownership and control of school property can be a complex issue, both constitutionally and in respect of property law and rights. The ownership of the vast majority of school property by religious orders and trusts is an historical legacy of how Ireland's education system developed. Typically, ownerships involve religious trusts; trustees; religious orders; bishops, both as landowners and school patrons; and the State. The divesting of the school in Newtownwhite to Educate Together was facilitated by transfer from the Church of Ireland. The Church of Ireland Trustees, which owns the property, and Educate Together engaged directly with each other in respect of the leasing arrangements for the property. A draft lease was drawn up but was not finalised and executed between the parties. The school authorities submitted an application to the Department for additional accommodation in September 2019 because an additional teacher had been sanctioned for the school. The Department recently approved funding for additional accommodation for the school to construct two mainstream classrooms, one special education teacher room and one toilet for assisted users. Given the timeframe for the planning permission process and the construction period, the school is working on interim solutions for September 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> On foot of a request from one of the parties, given that the school has been located in the property since 2014 and in recognition of the additional accommodation to be made available for the property, the Department recently agreed to engage with the representatives of the landowners with a view to regularising the position on the lease, which is good news for the Senator. I have been told by the Department to inform the Senator that the case is being actively progressed. As the engagement is ongoing, however, it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on it, although the Department is committed to finishing the process. Perhaps in a few weeks I will be able to provide further information but I am not currently at liberty to comment on the progress of the engagement.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">I thank the Minister of State for his response, from which I take some hope and positivity. Nevertheless, I am sure he will agree the issue of the lease, which has been ongoing since 2014, has taken an inordinate length of time to be resolved. It must be resolved, however, because as I have described, a further delay will hold the school back in respect of the provision of additional accommodation and the acquiring of adjoining land, which the school cannot do.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Will the Minister of State clarify whether the Department is party to the lease? My understanding is that a lease will be drawn up between the Department and the Church of Ireland, while a sublease will be provided to Educate Together. While the Minister of State's has not indicated that, it is indicated in the information provided to the school. It is a significant issue because the Minister of State seemed to indicate there is an issue between Educate Together and the Church of Ireland Trustees, whereas my information suggests that the issue is with the Department. The school community needs to identify the parties in question, the people who must agree on the lease and the parties to the lease. I do not know if the Minister of State has the information to hand but it is critical to what I have asked. Is the Department party to the lease?</p>

            <p eId="para_37">I agree with the Senator that dealing with this issue since 2014 is a long time. Given the timeframe of all that has happened, the planning permission process, the construction period and so forth, September 2019 is the date for the work to be put in place. I am not familiar with the question the Senator asked. I will find that answer for her and ensure that the relevant information associated with the question is given to her within several days.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, for taking the time out of his busy schedule to attend this critical debate on Shannon Airport, the entire western region and, particularly, my city, Limerick. The Minister is well aware of my interest in this area. I first raised the matter of Shannon Airport getting major European hub connectivity with him in the House on 6 December. Shannon Airport is the only international airport in Ireland which does not have major European hub connectivity on a year-on basis. While it has great connectivity through Heathrow, Dublin Airport has umpteen hub connections. I accept it serves the capital city and that is important. Cork Airport has good European hub connectivity through Amsterdam with two daily flights and Paris with one daily flight. Shannon Airport, however, has no direct European hub connectivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I raised the matter with the Minister on 6 December. I followed it up with a meeting on Wednesday, 6 February, with the Shannon Airport management group and the Minister at which I put forward the argument that a Brexit strategic route development fund should be established. It was a constructive meeting and, on foot of it, the Minister requested and encouraged Shannon Airport management group to make a submission to his Department on a route development strategy into a main European hub. I understand this submission was made to the Minister and the Department by the group on 21 March.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> The context of this is straightforward. Shannon is a key economic driver for the entire mid-west region, the western region and Limerick city. The airport is doing well but it has major excess capacity. Last year it served 1.86 million passengers but it has a capacity for 4.5 million passengers. Accordingly, it is operating at just over 40% of its capacity and could accommodate 2.6 million extra passengers. Dublin Airport is under severe pressure and the percentage of passengers its deals with is increasing. In 2005, it accounted for 72% of all air passengers. In the first quarter of 2019, however, Dublin Airport accounted for 87% while Shannon accounted for just under 4% and Cork over 6% of passenger numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">We are looking to drive economic growth outside Dublin exponentially under Project Ireland 2040. Shannon Airport must be a key element of this. The Minister's national aviation policy, the latest update of which appeared in February this year, talks about maximising the contribution of the aviation sector to Ireland's economic growth and development. In terms of individual airports, the Government is looking to attract new business and sustainable development to drive local economies. </p>
            <p eId="para_42"> I am asking for an update regarding a submission from Shannon Group to the Minister and Department on 21 March on foot of a meeting I organised with the management of Shannon Group on Wednesday, 6 February. Where is that proposal? We have very good connectivity through Heathrow Airport involving daily flights. In light of Brexit, We need to complement that with major European hub connectivity. Establishing a route out of Shannon Airport to a major European hub is critical in terms of Project Ireland 2040, Shannon Airport and, more particularly, the western region and my home city of Limerick. </p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2019-06-11T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_43">I thank the Senator for once again raising this very important issue. He has certainly been leading the field in addressing this issue and his concern for Shannon Airport is second to none. In whatever form it takes, Brexit will have a significant impact on Ireland and requires planning by Government, business and citizens as well as at European Union level. Brexit will have negative consequences in all scenarios but we are determined to be as ready as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> On 8 May, Ireland and the UK signed an important memorandum of understanding on the common travel area, CTA, reaffirming the commitment of the UK and Irish Governments to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances. Irish citizens will, therefore, continue to be able to move freely to live, work and study in the UK while British citizens can do the same in Ireland. Similarly, the European Commission's regulation aimed at ensuring basic air connectivity in a no-deal scenario has been finalised and the UK has confirmed its intention to reciprocate the proposed measures. While this cannot mitigate the overall impact of a no-deal scenario or the assurances contained in the negotiated withdrawal agreement, the fears that aircraft might not be able to fly in the event of a no-deal Brexit are being addressed and the risks to air travel between Ireland and the UK and the UK and the rest of Europe have been significantly mitigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> Government Departments, including mine, as well as key agencies, have been preparing for Brexit for three years now and notwithstanding any comfort we can take from commitments on the CTA and agreements on basic air connectivity, we continue to prepare through contingency planning and stakeholder engagement. Brexit is being managed on a whole-of-Government basis and my Department is represented on all relevant cross-departmental co-ordination structures. Additionally, an internal Brexit departmental committee meets monthly to oversee the Department's analyses and planning in the areas of aviation, maritime transport and tourism. Officials have regular, often daily, contact with stakeholders on Brexit planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Stakeholder engagement is important to the Government's domestic response to Brexit preparedness. As well as support provided by the Government, businesses and other affected sectors also need to respond and be prepared. Regardless of the impact of Brexit, there are some preparations that are purely good general business practice. For example, my officials and I have continually stressed the importance of all stakeholders, including Shannon Airport, taking necessary steps within their control to prepare for</p>
            <p eId="para_47">Brexit. This includes diversification of markets. The Senator will be aware that establishing air transport connections is the result of commercial agreements between airlines and airports. As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have no function in these commercial decisions. However, I support all endeavours of Shannon Airport to ensure its prosperity in line with Government policy and taking account of national and EU law.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The Senator referred to the fact that earlier this year, I met the chair and CEO of Shannon Group. During this meeting, Brexit was raised, particularly with regard to EU hub connectivity. I am aware that the company is endeavouring to secure alternative European hub connectivity post Brexit and is in discussions with several airline operators. The company has submitted a document, to which the Senator referred, to me on this matter. My officials are engaging with Shannon Group to explore what options are available to procure such air services, including supports from our tourism agency for co-operative marketing activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">The Government supports the development of air connectivity and the expansion of air services through funding from Tourism Ireland for co-operative marketing activity. Co-operative campaigns with partners facilitate increased marketing effort and help promote the destination. An increased Tourism Ireland budget for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by commitments to focus co-operative partnership activities on the January-April and October-December periods for Great Britain, North American and European markets. I continue to encourage all airports to avail of this funding to optimise air services, including Shannon Airport regarding alternative European hub connections.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> Project Ireland 2040 supports investment to promote high-quality international connectivity between Ireland the rest of the world. This is vital in underpinning international competitiveness and to responding to challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit. In line with the 2015 national aviation policy for Ireland, the role of Shannon Airport as a key tourism and business gateway will continue to be Government-supported. I welcome that Shannon Group is exploring ways of availing of funding under Project Ireland 2040, such as the urban regeneration and development fund and the rural regeneration and development fund. My Department is engaging with Shannon Group to ensure all opportunities are maximised for the benefit of it and the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response. In respect of the submission made by Shannon Group to him and his officials on 21 March last, he indicated that his officials and the Shannon Group are exploring what options are available to procure air services to other hubs, including support from the tourism agency and co-operative marketing activity. Time is of the essence. Brexit is on the horizon. From the point of view of Brexit readiness and Project Ireland 2040, which aims to achieve regional growth to complement Dublin, when does the Minister expect a decision to be made on the various options for progressing major hub connectivity between Shannon Group and other European airports such Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris? The key issue is to secure major European hub connectivity so that we are Brexit-proof and we can drive passenger numbers into Ireland and alleviate pressure on Dublin Airport. This would allow more people to fly into Shannon Airport where significant capacity is available. The airport would be able to deal with well in excess of 2 million extra passengers. As with Dublin Airport, Shannon has US pre-clearance. The airport has a great deal to offer. Will the Minister give a timeline by which his Department's formal consideration of the various options will conclude in order that Shannon Group can proceed with speed to get European route hub connectivity in place?</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I am afraid I have learned the hard way that giving timelines is foolish in these circumstances. It is not good for the Senator and it would not be good for me to do so. We will try to expedite this process and conclude as soon as we possibly can. If I were to give the Senator a timeline for achieving what he wants, it would assume that we would be able to achieve it. We will support the objective he has set out, as will Tourism Ireland and other agencies. However, to give the Senator a date would be speculative and might raise false hopes that something will happen sooner. My Department and I realise the urgency of this matter. I will ask my officials to accelerate the talks in response to what the Senator has said and to continue to pursue the objective that he and my officials and I believe is important.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I thank the Leader for outlining the Order of Business for today. I note the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 is back again.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I wish to raise an important report published by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. The words do not come from Fianna Fáil or the Opposition but from the Government's body, which points out that there are very significant challenges ahead. It states that while growth is good, between €3 billion and €6 billion of our €10 billion in corporation tax is quite vulnerable. Of course, there is still the risk of a no-deal Brexit, which is certainly not off the table but very possible based on what is happening in the United Kingdom. We have seen many spending Estimates massively ignored. There was an additional €645 million in supplementary funding for the Department of Health last year and overspends on capital projects such as the national children's hospital and broadband are happening far too often.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> The council has pointed out that the Government is very vulnerable to slippage in corporation tax. The digital taxation agenda, which is worldwide at this stage in terms of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and what is being discussed, has the potential to damage our corporation tax receipts. Members should not misunderstand me - the more corporation tax we get, the better. It is positive that there is so much foreign direct investment in this country, but let us not underestimate its vulnerability. Thankfully, the estimates of corporation tax in all previous years up to recently have underestimated what we got. We got more. However, what goes up probably ends up going down. I believe we must have a debate about our fiscal policy, our spending, the Estimates and that vulnerability. In previous years people quite rightly criticised an over-reliance on stamp duty, but any drop in the corporation tax being paid by the top ten companies which pay half of the corporation tax would be very difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> Second, I welcome the start of Men's Health Week, which began yesterday and runs until Father's Day next Sunday. The purpose of the week is to highlight awareness of preventable health problems for men of all ages. On average, men die four years younger than women and they have higher death rates than women in respect of all the leading causes of death. Their smoking, drinking, obesity and suicide rates are much higher. In Ireland, 75% of suicides are by men. We must encourage men to look after their health and to take cognisance of what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> Finally, it is almost 30 years since smoky coal was banned in Dublin and other urban centres, but despite the green agenda and all our talk about climate change the Minister is still refusing to introduce a nationwide ban. He is basically giving way to lobbyists who say it cannot be done. If people in cities are entitled to clean air, people in the rest of the country are equally entitled to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">I ask that the Minister come to the House to tell us why he is not introducing a ban. He should introduce a ban on smoky coal across the State as soon as possible. Everybody deserves to have clean air, not just the people in the cities.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I call for a debate on the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. Over the weekend we heard of the terrible stigma attached to this scheme where low-income families, especially single mothers, are finding it extremely difficult to secure rental housing due to the stigma attached to the housing assistance payment. The private rental market is not equipped to deal with the volume of renters, who are disproportionately low income earners in comparison with homeowners. In many cases landlords do not want to deal with HAP while in other cases landlords simply do not know how. The burden then falls on social housing provision, which we all know to be sorely lacking. Due to chronic undersupply many people who should qualify for social housing are ranked instead as non-priority. The problem HAP was introduced to solve persists. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has said as much in what should have been a call to action in 2015 when it reported on the inadequate provision of housing leading to family homelessness. To its and to our dismay, the IHREC has again reiterated its position. Under the European Social Charter it is the State's responsibility to provide for the right of the family to social, legal and economic protection. The European Committee of Social Rights, ECSR, has constantly interpreted the right to economic, legal and social protection of family life, covered in Article 16 of the charter, as guaranteeing the right to adequate housing for families. It is, therefore, the State's responsibility to provide adequate housing for families, but clearly the State is failing. According to the IHREC newly released Comments on Ireland’s 16th National Report on the implementation of the European Social Charter "...the State’s failure to take sufficient and timely measures to ensure the social housing provided to families is of an adequate standard is a violation of Article 16." One could not have it put any clearer than that. The commission's report further states: "The decision to withdraw from building social housing and to instead provide rent supplement for private renters has made low income households extremely vulnerable to shocks in the housing market."</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> Fine Gael is failing the most vulnerable in our society. Working people across the island face discrimination of many varieties on a regular basis. We should not tolerate this but the Government does little to act on one of the most prevalent human rights deficits or abuses in the State, which is centred in this city. There are few forms of discrimination more heinous than the blight of homelessness, which is discrimination in the area of human rights based on income. Housing is a human right but the State continues to send out the message that this applies only if a person can pay for it. Human rights are not to be bought and sold, nor attached to income thresholds. Rather, it is our duty in these Houses to ensure that those rights are upheld. Every day that passes without the right to a home being enshrined in our Constitution, our collective shame grows in proportion to the number of families and children who live on our streets and in emergency accommodation. Current solutions are nothing but a bandage over this wound in our national pride. Government targets are not being met, and even if they were they are not high enough. This is evidence of a Government that does not cherish all the children of the nation equally.</p>

          <from>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2019-06-11T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_63">Over the last weeks we heard the Government asking older people to downsize from their homes and perhaps move to smaller homes in villages, retirement spaces or to spaces in voluntary private and public nursing homes. I raised this issue previously and asked about the possibility of bringing the Minister for Health to this House. I want to discuss healthcare assistants because we need them. Some 6,000 people in Ireland do not have homecare help. There are 1,800 vacancies for healthcare assistants in Ireland yet to be filled. I would like the Minister to come to the House to tell me what he would like to do about the situation, how he would like to improve conditions for current healthcare assistants and how he might like to find solutions within communities for healthcare assistants within people's homes and within nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">People in villages and towns all over this country would be very happy to give up hours of their lives to provide home care and deal with the elderly if their pensions or social welfare benefits were not minimised or subjected to penalties as a result. Addressing that could be one part of many parts of a creative solution to this problem. As I have said previously, we should consider opening up the area of critical skills to healthcare assistants from abroad when we do not have enough in our own country. We should, however, start with creative solutions in our own country, of which there are many. We are not encouraging enough creative solutions, nor are we encouraging people in towns and villages who want to give help and aid to people they know who need help, whether it is acute care or just a few hours of their time each day. People are afraid to do so because if they were to be paid for it, they would be penalised as they may have a small pension or social welfare entitlement. We need to seriously think about this issue because it is very serious. It is even more serious when one considers that we have 800 people in acute hospitals who cannot go home because there is nobody to care for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> Members can talk all they like about housing, downsizing, taking people out of houses, minimising the size of houses and building villages. That is all very well but it will not work unless we have services in place. I am blue in the face from saying this and I know what I am talking about having watched a parent for three years with home care help who is now in a nursing home. We better start attending to this issue because I am looking around and we are not getting younger. Maybe the Members of the next Seanad will all be under 40 but this one is not.</p>

I would like to put that in the context of the Government's decision, under pressure from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to reopen the Garda station in Stepaside, an area with falling crime statistics. In the north inner city, Fitzgibbon Street Garda station has been closed or maybe there is one garda working in an adjoining office. It is disgraceful that while the most deprived area of the city and the area with the highest crime rate does not have a proper Garda station, whereas Stepaside, a well heeled area in the Dublin mountains, is having a Garda station reopened at a cost of €1.5 million. It is a classic example of the Minister's stroke politics.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">I want to briefly raise the issue of Spinraza.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Many Members of this House have raised the necessity for Spinraza to be provided to children with a very rare genetic disease, spinal muscular atrophy. I am happy to say that today the Health Service Executive, HSE, leadership team has approved the drug. I was quietly confident that it would be approved but I think until it was delivered the families deeply affected by the disease did not believe it would be. I commend the Minister for Health on his fortitude in insisting on, and pushing for, that drug to be provided. There are only 25 children in the country affected by this disease. The drug is very expensive and there was a health technology assessment. We should approach such assessments on an EU basis because with economies of scale we would have more negotiating power with drug companies as a bloc. The way it currently operates is, in my view, unsatisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> It has come to my attention recently that bottle banks which had been on private land in two locations in north Dublin were suddenly taken away and that they are no longer provided in this area of Kilbarrack and that one may be taken away in Killester. It is not on that it should happen without there being an obvious place for people to go with their material for recycling. There should be a national approach and a policy whereby these are provided in locations where they cannot just be taken away overnight. Everyone is talking about the environment now with good reason but with actions such as this we are shooting ourselves in the foot. It is a simple thing where people are in the habit of recycling and it is ridiculous for that opportunity to be taken away from them.</p>

As far as I am aware there is a review going on. Ray Quinn, who has campaigned on this for several years, has come up with a couple of very logical proposals in respect of minimum jail sentences for crimes such as murder, and for parole boards to seek advice and input from local gardaí, on the use of electronic tagging and on appointing a victims' representative on the parole board. These are logical and practical amendments that could be made to the Bill, if it comes to this House. Will the Leader find out when this proposed legislation will come here, or ask the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to address the House on the review that is going on because this needs to be addressed?</p>

          <p eId="para_88">The HSE has raised health alarms about uncontrolled pumping of sewage into Dublin Bay in the past few days. The alarms were to stop children playing on the sand on the beaches north and south of Dublin Bay. It is an absolute scandal. There is a plant in Ringsend that is operating at 20% over its capabilities and capacity. There are what are called in the words of Irish Water controlled and uncontrolled releases. Rainwater or grey water goes into the sewage treatment plant in Poolbeg, which serves 40% of the country's wastewater, then solids rise in water tanks and are deliberately released because the tanks cannot cope with the capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">We are addressing housing, planning and economic prosperity as part of the bigger plan to invest and encourage growth in Dublin and other locations. As a result, we have to address this matter. The best Irish Water can do is indicate that it is working on increasing the capacity in its sewerage plant but that we cannot expect anything to be completed by 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> We have a serious problem. We are actively discharging sewage into Dublin Bay. From Merrion Strand through Booterstown, Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire, Dalkey, Killiney and out as far as Shankill, we have had contaminated our coastal waters. This is a health issue that impacts on the constituency of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. I ask that he come before the House and indicate how we can address it in the short term. We have a major capacity problem at Ringsend that is giving rise to a serious health concern for people.</p>

I was recently approached by a person who received an award from the redress board and who is on a means-tested social welfare payment. The person was informed that their case would be reassessed as a result of the award from the board. That is absolutely crazy. Those who have received money from the redress board may have worked in the Magdalen laundries, or may have been abused or exploited in other ways, and are dependent on the social welfare payments to which they are entitled. I shudder to think that people's entitlements might be taken away because of money they received in respect of exploitation that took place many years ago. The position must be clarified and the matter corrected if that to which I refer proves to be the case. The person who made representations to me about it was told by health board officials that it was the case. I would like to get clarification as soon as possible.</p>

I commend our colleagues, Senator Gavan and Nash, who hosted a briefing earlier in the audiovisual, AV, room on the National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017. Senator Gavan will be bringing the Bill before the House tomorrow for Report Stage. This is a very important Private Members' Bill which the Labour Party, as well as my colleague, Senator Norris, will be delighted to support. It will give protection to employees and ensure that the tips customers think they are paying to waiting staff will actually go to them. I cannot understand why the Government would oppose the Bill. There have been indications that it will not be supported by Government, which is unfortunate. Many of us, myself included, have worked in the service industry and all of us are well aware that there is an ongoing practice whereby so-called service charges are not paid to employees but are kept or withheld by employers. We need to ensure that there is regulation in this area. I will be surprised if the Government continues to oppose the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I ask the Leader for a debate on women's health in light of the revelations that are emerging on foot of the publication of second Scally report earlier today. My colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Kelly, has pointed out that the report is producing more questions than answers in many ways. It appears that a laboratory in Manchester which was not accredited was analysing smear tests from women in Ireland. A good deal of material is emerging. In light of those disclosures and in view of what is happening with the national maternity hospital and the ongoing issues with ethical governance there, it would be useful to have a debate in due course.</p>

It raises a question about inclusivity in sport, however, and whether that pertains to the migrant community, older people, younger people, men, women, LGBT brothers and sisters or those living with disabilities. It was an issue that came up on the doorsteps in the local elections, when people asked about inclusivity in sport as part of local recreation strategies. I call on the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Ross, or the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, to the House to talk about a national strategy for inclusivity in sport. They should take the example of the brilliant Union Cup and the excellent voluntary effort of the Emerald Warriors to spread it out across the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I wish to raise the issue of the district hospital network, specifically with regard to Belmullet hospital. On Friday, 31 May the HSE announced that all temporary staff would not have their contracts renewed and that all agency staff would be let go with immediate effect. This came as a bolt from the blue for the staff, the community and the GPs, including myself. If staff numbers are diminished it would lead to a direct degradation of the hospital. It has been fiercely opposed by the community and I commend Senator Conway-Walsh for facilitating a public meeting last night, at which there was a massive turnout. I have spoken on many occasions in this House, on the Order of Business or in Commencement debates with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, about the district hospital network. These hospitals play a vital role in preventing admissions to, and facilitating discharges from, acute hospitals and this is especially important in the case of the hospital to which I refer, which is over 50 miles away from Castlebar.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> The district hospital network should not be seen as a relic of a bygone era as, with appropriate investment, its hospitals can facilitate respite care. GPs and public health nurses can admit patients to these hospitals and some of them even have palliative care beds. They get people off trolleys in acute hospitals because patients can be referred back to the district hospital. They are a vital cog in the delivery of a modern health system and I would be grateful if the Leader would arrange for the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, to come into the House in the next few weeks to discuss the national district hospital network.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> I am delighted with the announcement about Spinraza. I am thinking of Grace O'Malley, the nine year old girl from outside Ballinrobe who came up here with her parents earlier on in the year, and it is a fantastic announcement.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">I convened a meeting last week in Leinster House at the request of the Irish freight industry, led by Seamus Leheny of Freight Northern lreland and Verona Murphy of the Irish Road Haulage Association. We were accompanied by a number of representatives from transport companies north and south of the Border, many operating in the transportation of food and perishable products. Last night, I visited a refrigerated freight company less than 20 miles from the Border, which is responsible for nearly 30% of the agrifood freight between North and South, in order to see at first hand how complicated a process this was. It is a depot where over 2,000 palettes per night were shifted in the business of feeding people north and south of the Border, seven days a week, 365 days of the year. It paints a bleak picture of what will happen after Brexit and there are particular concerns within the freight industry regarding a no-deal Brexit, especially the impact in the area of agrifood. Concerns were raised last week in Leinster House about the number of extra vets necessary to carry out inspections, with one company stating that it would need 35 vets per night because some loads would have to be inspected three times.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">Concerns were raised about groupage work and hundreds of loads with multiple drops per lorry every night. Concerns were also raised about supply chains, resourcing and the potential impact on agriculture, farm businesses and, ultimately, jobs. Concerns were further raised about stockpiling currently and the negative impact that has.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> Seamus Leheny shared some interesting facts about cross-Border traffic on social media in recent days. The A1 crossing between Newry and Dundalk is currently a frictionless, strategic crossing. On 5 June, in one 24-hour period, 8,390 goods vehicles crossed the Border via the A1, namely, 3,038 articulated vehicles, 919 rigid vehicles and 4,434 large goods vehicles, averaging 167 vehicles per hour or one lorry every 35 seconds. If we consider six of the 300 crossings, we find that 13,483 vehicles crossed in the same 24-hour period. If we consider that the average delay at a border is ten minutes, with agrifood presenting extra complexity due to sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, controls, and the fact that 33% of the sales to the Republic of Ireland is agrifood, we can then deduce that at peak times this equates to 115 lorries carrying agrifood and subject to these controls, with up to 50% undergoing physical inspections. These means that one lorry would need to be inspected every 32 seconds. In one hour, there would be a backlog of 70 trucks stretching 1 km down the motorway. Bearing in mind that these trucks work on a delivery window for perishable goods of 45 minutes at depots, very large penalties and costs will be incurred. A no-deal Brexit will create paralysis on the Border, add costs and cause friction and congestion. Ultimately, trade and business on both sides of the Border will suffer. No technological solution currently exists. The complexity of this situation cannot be understated and the potential damage to the economy cannot be overstated. When this group was asked about the one takeaway point from the meeting, it cited uncertainty and lack of clarity as the main concern. I request the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come into the House to answer questions specifically on what plans are afoot to deal with these issues, what role the Government can have in addressing fears and concerns for the freight industry across the island, North and South, and what can be done to answer criticism from this industry that a degree of intransigence in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is presenting major concerns for some within the industry. This issue is not currently understood by politicians or civil servants in Dublin, Belfast or London. It is complicated and difficult but it must be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">I warmly welcome the revised fair deal rules which came before Cabinet today. They have been long awaited and are much needed and they will alleviate the situation in which farmers and small businesses find themselves. The new rules will see a three-year cap on a 7.5% contribution from farmers and small business owners. This has been advocated by the farming organisations in particular. In the course of my public representation duties, I have encountered individual farmers who have been severely impacted by the current regime under which no cap applies and people face the prospect of an unlimited fee, tax or charge being applied to an asset. This provision impacts on the future viability of farms and small businesses because it is like carrying a massive charge or loan on a property. The 7.5% contribution can be more than the income one would earn from a business or a farm in terms of one's profit. The current regime means that many farmers delayed going into a nursing home when they needed that care. We are all living longer and we have to look after our elderly. We have to make provision for their care and it must be paid for. People need to contribute towards that cost but it cannot be an undue burden that people cannot manage. Some fairness has prevailed in this matter being approved by Cabinet. Likewise, I hope we can begin to examine the introduction of a similar fair deal type statutory model for home care packages.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> With the Cathaoirleach's indulgence, I also warmly welcome the announcement today of the approval of the drug, Spinraza. While the number of families concerned is small, the impact of its approval will be tremendous for them. I am sure they are breathing a sigh of relief for their loved ones who badly need to know they can secure a continuous supply of this medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">I wish them all well and I compliment the Minister for sticking with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">I do not have a particular ask of the Leader today, <i>per se</i>, but I have set out a job of work for myself and I hope for other colleagues as well. I wish to talk briefly about reconciliation within the context of competing narratives, in particular as we continue to navigate our way through these most crucial years of the decade of centenaries, as they have become known. I think back to the example that I hope was set in Belfast City Hall where councillors invested £3.5 million in a permanent exhibition telling and reflecting the competing narratives and experiences of our collective past. While it has been testing and challenging at times, all of us, right across the traditions, have met the challenge head on, even though at times it has been hard and difficult for us. I think of that as one example.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> I also think of the impressive sight of a portrait of the rebel countess, Countess Markievicz, being hung in Westminster as part of the centenary of the 1916 Rising and the 1918 election and history that was made. In this building too we reflect in equal stature people from a pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty perspective. We do not shy away from that, which is important. As we head further into the decade of centenaries we will all have to think of how we challenge ourselves and challenge each other to respectfully engage with our past, learn from it and build a better future for all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> I will outline the piece of work that I will undertake as a Belfast man. On this day in 1981 Kieran Doherty was elected Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan. He was an Anti-H Block/Armagh candidate. He was also a hunger striker in Long Kesh at the time. He died a short period after being elected and never got to take up his seat in Leinster House. Navigating again through the challenging and at times contesting and competing narratives of our past we reflect on how we also might reflect Kieran - his experience, community and constituency of that time who hold him in the highest regard, as we do in Belfast as well – his loss and sacrifice in this building alongside people who sacrificed in a similar vein.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">I wish to ask the Leader of the House if he would consider the point made by Senator Davitt regarding representations made by Councillor Suzanne Doyle, a member of Kildare County Council, along with the campaigner, Ray Quinn, that the Minister for Justice and Equality could come into the House to give a response to the well put together document which also has the signatures of all councillors in County Kildare. They are taking the issue very seriously and we should respond in a serious manner to their request.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> Following on from what Senator Lawlor said, I had intended raising the issue of insurance as it is the most crucial issue currently. We have heard about many hard cases yet there has been no response. An all-party group composed of the Government and the Opposition should be tackling this issue. I do not know whether the Judicial Council Bill will make any difference. I read an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 16 May saying that a judge said a crash victim was prone to exaggeration before awarding her €10,000. At one time I praised the President of the Circuit Court, Mr. Justice Groarke, because I thought he was doing great work. In this case he said Ms Cantaragiu was "prone to misdescription, exaggeration, misrepresentation, apparent falsehood and a lack of accuracy about injuries, previous medical history and her attendances with doctors". He said he believed her complaint of injury to her neck and lower back was "probably correct", and that he would award her general damages of €10,000, jointly and severally against all the parties involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_115"> In today's edition of the <i>Roscommon Herald</i>, there is an article about a prominent businessman, Martin Mulligan from the Roscommon side of Athlone, who has been in business with his wife for 40 years and employs 16 people. The cost of his insurance has risen fourfold from €7,000 to €30,000, which will put his business in jeopardy. We are all wringing our hands and everybody, including the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is speaking about the issue, but nobody in the Government takes it seriously. That is why I asked the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to return to the House and outline what exactly is happening. If the passage of the Judicial Council Bill is necessary, why can it not be passed? We have plenty of time. The House was adjourned last week. That Bill should not be blamed for preventing this issue from being addressed. I do not know what is going on because, quite frankly-----</p>

          <p eId="para_130">I, too, congratulate Senator Grace O'Sullivan, who follows current and former Members of the Houses who have been elected to the European Parliament over the years, such as Deputies Fitzgerald and Kelleher, as well as Mr. Jim Higgins, Ms Deirdre Clune, Ms Avril Doyle and Mr. Joe McCartin, all of whom were once Deputies and Senators. I assume there are other cases of former Members who were elected to the European Parliament. I wish Senator Grace O'Sullivan well.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> I support Senator O'Mahony's point about the redress board and the compensation awarded to people. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection now asks those claiming social welfare for various details. When he was Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen apologised to people such as those outlined by the Senator for how they were treated by the State. It is unbelievable that the Department would hound those people, given that the then Taoiseach apologised to them. One wonders what a Taoiseach's apology is worth. I hope Senator O'Mahony receives a prompt response to clarify the matter quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for apologising to Ms Angela Kerins following the recent Supreme Court decision. In a recent interview on how the Oireachtas will conduct its business in future, the Ceann Comhairle indicated that an internal group of civil servants had been assembled to examine the decision's implications and the broader functions of the Oireachtas. He also said the group was considering streamlining how committees function, perhaps by giving the Business Committee a role. He went on to say changes were imminent and that he hopes to put proposals to the Dáil in September to amend its Standing Orders. Will the Leader outline the role of this House in the changes that may be brought about, or in setting up an internal committee to review how committees are established and their roles and responsibilities? He might give some indication in that regard because in the past three years, the Business Committee has not shown any respect for this House. If it is to have a role in how this House runs or in how we conduct our business, I will have grave reservations.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I apologise that I was not here earlier. I hope I will not be repeating what other Members may have stated. The Judicial Council Bill has received support right across the House from Senators of every view and outlook. Amendments were facilitated on Committee Stage in order to see the legislation through. We were promised that further amendments would be tabled on Report Stage. The time to be taken to formulate those amendments, which was originally thought to be a week, has extended to more than a month. Will the Leader tell us when it is proposed to take the remaining Stages of the Judicial Council Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> Like Senator Leyden, I do not believe judicial guidelines provided for in the Judicial Council Bill will be the be-all and end-all when it comes to how the State deals with compensation culture. As far back as 2004, the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which was introduced when I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, facilitated the introduction of extensive powers requiring people to swear affidavits, created criminal offences and required solicitors receiving instructions in civil litigation to explain clearly to their clients the implications of exaggerating claims. The courts were given the express power to throw out an entire claim if any part of it was materially exaggerated. That was done in the naive hope that civil litigation would be made more reasonable as a consequence. Perhaps it has become more reasonable as a consequence. At least, that law is in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> Senator Ó Céidigh tabled a perjury Bill which also received unanimous support in the House, as well as support from the Department of Justice and Equality. I was given to understand Government time would be made available for that Bill in order that it might progress. However, we are now about to have yet another session on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, for which there is no public demand and which is a solution in search of a problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_142"> I pay tribute and congratulate our colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, on her election to the European Parliament. I know she will be a wonderful MEP.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> Yesterday, I visited Westminster. Like the Taoiseach, I am concerned with the tone of the Conservative Party leadership race. Everywhere I went yesterday, I was asked about the backstop and whether it can be renegotiated. Every time I stated that it absolutely cannot be renegotiated and that the only deal is the one on the table. The next month will be trying for the EU, the Government and, indeed, the British people. What is happening is a charade. It is not understood that there is only one deal in town, namely, the withdrawal agreement. I am concerned - the Taoiseach said this in the Dáil only a few minutes ago - that what is happening in the UK represents a disregarding of the responsibilities of national politicians. Yesterday, I told every politician who asked me about the backstop that there is no way there can be a border on the island of Ireland and that the matter is not up for negotiation.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">It is very concerning. All parties here are holding the line that the only agreement in town is the withdrawal agreement, which was agreed by diplomats from both countries and the EU. It is just very frustrating.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">I thank the 18 Members for their contributions to the Order of Business. I join with all colleagues in congratulating our colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, on her election to the European Parliament. We wish her well and look forward to the second by-election on the agricultural panel in Seanad Éireann. I also congratulate all Members elected to the European Parliament and wish them well in their term of office. I welcome our colleague and friend, Michael Mullins, and the friends of Senator Hopkins to the Public Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> I also join with Members in raising the issue of Spinraza and congratulate everyone involved. I pay tribute to the Minister for, as Senator Noone noted, his perseverance and willingness to continue the campaign. I welcome the decision today. </p>
          <p eId="para_147"> Senator Horkan raised the remarks today of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. In the context of the conversation, the Minister and the Government note the remarks and articulation by Professor Coffey and other members of the council. I remind Senator Horkan that it was the previous Government that set up the council in order to have an open and frank dialogue and to shine a light on our economic policy. I challenge Senator Horkan to look at the proposals by his own party colleagues and front bench and every single promise made by Fianna Fáil in the run up to the next general election - whenever that is - that, along with those of Sinn Féin, would probably bankrupt the country. Let us be clear. We are a small open economy and we are at risk. To to be fair, the Minister recognises that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has a role to play. He takes its advice. Our surplus is 0.2%, we have balanced the books and put aside a rainy day fund, unemployment is down to 4.6% or below, and we are investing 25% more in infrastructure. The Government has committed to reducing our debt burden. We are creating more jobs than ever before. However, I accept the point that there needs to be prudence. This requires prudence on the part of everybody in politics so that they do not grandstand with the electorate and promise everything and we have an honest debate about what we can and cannot achieve. I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House. The summer economic statement will be put before the House before we conclude for the summer recess. I take Senator Horkan's points regarding that. </p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Many of us share the Senator's concern that the ban on smoky coal should have been introduced a long time ago but as he knows, the ban is of benefit to the country in terms of health, health outcomes, fresh air and breathing. However, we live in a litigious society and there is the threat of litigation. As the Taoiseach said in the Dáil today, that is part of the reason but I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Senators Gavan and Bacik referred to tomorrow night's Private Members' business. The Minister has articulated a view that we need to be careful in what we do to ensure fairness around tips for workers and that there is transparency in that matter. Tips are for workers. The Minister will bring forward a payment of wages Bill in due course. We will have that debate tomorrow night and I look forward to the Minister coming to the House for it. </p>
          <p eId="para_150"> Senator Gavan spoke about the HAP scheme. Again, rather than delaying the House in giving a huge amount of time to the matter, I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House for a debate. Alternatively, Senator Gavan might be best served by raising the issue as a Commencement matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell raised the issue of healthcare assistants. She spoke about the need to fill vacant positions and tackle the critical skills shortage that exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">She also raised the issue of being able to age with dignity and care. We concur and agree with all of these points. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has always said it is not about downsizing; it is about right sizing. I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House and have a debate on the matter in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> Senator Norris raised the issue of litter on the north side. I do not necessarily agree with the Senator. The issue has also to do with a cultural attitude to littering. It is not about having plastic bags. It is about getting the mind right regarding litter.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> We all share the Senator's concern about the stabbing on O'Connell Street this morning. The Government has reopened Garda stations. We have increased investment in An Garda Síochána. As Senator Norris may have seen from the latest report by the Garda Commissioner in the allocation of the new recruits predominately to the north side of Dublin and to Drogheda, the Government is committed to ensuring that there is adequate policing in the areas to which the Senator refers.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Senator Noone also raised the important issue of bottle banks being removed. The point the Senator makes is that in the context of those on private property, but also on public property, we need to find alternatives to give people an option to recycle and to be able to become, as I say, culturally in tune with what is the right thing to do. I commend the Senator for that suggestion. I thank her also for raising the issue of the European Union being able to negotiate on the issue of our drugs basket.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Senators Davitt and Leyden raised the issue of the Parole Board. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is acutely aware of the pain and trauma suffered by victims of crime. The Minister takes great care in reviewing the recommendations of the Parole Board. There is, as the Senators will be aware, a Bill imminent. The Minister is working on that Bill. It will be before the House as soon as it is ready. The Minister is extensively engaging with others on that particular matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Senator Boyhan raised the important matter of sewage in Dublin Bay. It is one to which a response needs to be activated quickly. We saw the benefit of Irish Water where Cork Harbour is now clean and where we have seen the elimination of dumping of raw sewage into the harbour. Dublin Bay will benefit from similar activity by Irish Water in tandem with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Both Senators O'Mahony and Paddy Burke raised the issue of the payment by the redress board to an individual in receipt of a social welfare payment. Both Members make valid points regarding the issue. It is one for which I do not have an answer. It is one with which I do not necessarily agree. Senators O'Mahony and Paddy Burke might be best served by putting a Commencement matter before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Senators Horkan and Bacik raised in a roundabout way similar issues about women's health and men's health. I would be happy to have them debated in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I join Senator Richmond in congratulating the Emerald Warriors on the successful hosting of the Union Cup. It was a good weekend of inclusivity for men's and women's rugby in Dublin. I congratulate all involved on what was a wonderful showcasing of Ireland, and as Senator Richmond rightly said, of the voluntary effort by the Emerald Warriors' committee. I commend all involved. I thank Senator Richmond, who is wearing the tie this afternoon in the House, for his support of, and representation of the Oireachtas at, the event at the weekend. I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Ross, or the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, come to the House to have a debate on inclusivity in sport. It is something that we need to see debated, but also we need to encourage men and women in sport to be more inclusive in attitude.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">Especially boxing, yes.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Senator Swanick raised the issue of Belmullet hospital. I understand both the Minister, Deputy Ring, and Councillor Gerry Coyle have been very active in the matter and have been engaged with the HSE, which has refuted the accusation that there will be no more admissions. There is an issue around three temporary contracts from three staff members who have been redeployed and have been given the option following discussion with the representatives in the area. The district hospital in Belmullet and Áras Deirbhle are very important locally to the people of Erris and beyond. I am told there is no imminent threat to the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I am sure Senator Swanick can table a Commencement matter on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Senators Lawlor, Leyden and McDowell raised the issue of insurance. I am pleased to inform the House that the Judicial Council Bill 2017 will be taken in the House next Thursday and there will be an opportunity for Members to submit amendments, if they so wish, by the following Tuesday. The Government is prioritising the passage of the Judicial Council Bill 2017. We have had debates on insurance on a number of occasions. I hope Members will be aware of what is happening when they make comments in the House in regard to the priority of Government business. We are all aware awards are too high. I agree with Senator McDowell that one Bill, in itself, will not end the spiralling awards or costs. There needs to be a cultural change here and that requires an absolutely honest conversation around the issue of insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> The Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018 is also ready to be debated and was to be on the schedule for next week but for some reason, it will not be on the schedule until the week after. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is ready to proceed with it. It was not the fault of the Government that it was not available for next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Senator Marshall raised the very important issue regarding haulage and freight and the need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House. I will be happy to facilitate a debate at the earliest opportunity. Senator Mulherin raised the new fair deal scheme rules to be brought in for small and medium-sized enterprises and for farmers. I welcome and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on his proposals which were brought to Cabinet today. We will have a debate on the fair deal scheme in a matter of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> Senator Ó Donnghaile raised the issue of reconciliation. It is important in the context of our centenary of commemorations that we have a conversation around commemoration. Senator McDowell was involved in a very informative television programme recently and I saw the programme on Dolours Price last night. Senator Ó Donnghaile referred to Kieran Doherty being elected on this day in 1981 along with Paddy Agnew. June 1981 was a tremendous period for the Fine Gael Party. We won 65 seats under Garret FitzGerald in the election that year. It was not a good day for Mr. Haughey as Members opposite will recall. I am sure Senator Leyden is still smiling.</p>

          <p eId="para_179"> Senator Paddy Burke raised the issue of the Committee on Procedure of the Dáil and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Seanad, on which the Cathaoirleach commented, and the apology by the Ceann Comhairle to Angela Kerins. It is time that we, as a House, took a stand, independent and separate from the Lower House. We are joined to the Lower House as, constitutionally, we are part of the Oireachtas. The people decided not to abolish this House. There is an obligation and duty on us as custodians of this House to stand up for it. I believe some of the Members of the Dáil Business Committee would rather that we were not here at all. We should have an honest discussion at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on how we are viewed, our role under the Constitution, and where we are in the Oireachtas. We should not allow for the airbrushing or removal of Seanad Éireann or its Members from committees, or from dealing with certain issues pertaining to the matters of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I concur with Senator Paddy Burke's sentiments on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">The subsection provides that the published statement may set out different selection procedures in regard to appointments to different judicial offices. I fully understand why one might have different procedures for appointments to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. However, in paragraph (b), does the phrase "a particular judicial office" refer to the Chief Justice, the presidency of the Court of Appeal or the presidency of another particular court? Or does it refer to a level of office, such as High Court judge? Assuming, for instance, that a vacancy in the Court of Appeal, as an ordinary member of that court, comes under the category of "a particular judicial office", then there may be different procedures where applicants for that vacancy already hold judicial office. How will this differential published statement operate where there are some applicants who already hold judicial office and others who do not? That is the question I am raising.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">The wording of subsection (2) is a little sloppy. It would be sufficient to say, "The published statement may set out different selection procedures in relation to appointments to different judicial offices." That would cover it all because it enables the appointments commission to establish different selection procedures in respect of different judicial offices. Why is it necessary to include the second paragraph referencing "a particular office where applicants already hold judicial office"? I do not understand the need for it given that the first paragraph already gives the commission power to do different things in terms of different judicial offices. In addition, the wording of the subsection is quite opaque and certainly cannot be said to be written in clearly understandable English. It states: "... the subsequent provisions of this Part shall be construed and have effect in a manner that enables the setting out, in the published statement, of selection procedures that, in relation to the foregoing appointments, are different from one another." That is a mouthful.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Finally, subsection (3) states: "In addition to the selection procedures, the published statement shall contain a statement of requisite skills and attributes which stands approved under <i>section 54</i>." Without rehashing the whole argument again, there is no mention of experience, only the reference to "skills and attributes". Surely experience is the most crucial criterion?</p>

          <p eId="para_235">I do not agree. The published statement may set out different selection procedures depending on the judicial office or, indeed, the procedures that may have been applied from time to time. It deals with the various offices, be it at District Court, Circuit Court or High Court level, and so on. Paragraph (b) covers a situation where the applicant may already have been a serving judge of the District Court, Circuit Court, etc. The statement setting out the selection procedures is something that may, on occasion, be done, depending on the commission. The published statement shall contain the statement in respect of the attributes and skills, in accordance with section 54. I do not see how the section can be called opaque, as Senator Norris described it.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">Subsection (2)(b) provides that the published statement may set out different selection procedures in respect of appointments to "a particular judicial office where applicants already hold judicial office".</p>
          <p eId="para_237">For instance, take the case of a vacancy for an ordinary member of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. Is a District Court judge to be given a different mode of selection procedure from, say, a senior solicitor applying for the job on the basis that a District Court judge is already the holder of judicial office, even though he is, so to speak, a number of rungs down the judicial ladder? Is section 52(2)(b) to be interpreted as really meaning that there can be different selection procedures in relation to applicants who hold judicial office rather than different selection procedures in relation to a particular judicial office? That is the ambiguity at which I am looking.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> I can understand if there was a different selection procedure in relation to applicants who hold judicial office.

          <p eId="para_240">It would be fine if section 52(2)(b) read “different procedures in relation to appointments to different judicial offices and to applicants who already hold judicial office”. However, when the words “a particular judicial office” are inserted, I am just wondering what practical effect that particular formulation of words means. In other words, does one say that an ordinary member of the Court of Appeal can be the subject of different selection procedures where District Court judges are applying or does it mean something else?</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I believe section 52(2)(a) covers section 52(2)(b) with the words “different judicial offices”. More importantly, I am not sure why there should be a different selection procedure just because somebody is a judge. What is the point of that? Would the fact that some applicant had already held a judicial office be a help or a hindrance? What happened to the whole notion of merit? I would have thought people would be promoted on merit rather than on anything else.</p>

          <p eId="para_243"> The wording of section 52(2)(b), “a particular judicial office”, is a distinction from the office already held.

This will be a particular judicial office which will be the one to which the vacancy shall apply.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">I slightly disagree with Senator Craughwell on that. My view is that one can differentiate between serving judges and other persons who have never been appointed. I have no problem with that as long as there is some capacity to distinguish between different types of serving judges applying for judicial office. It is strange to say that a District Judge who wanted to be an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court should be in a radically different position from, say, a senior solicitor or senior barrister who had practised in those courts for 25 years and that the latter should be interviewed but the judge should not. That seems to be a strange situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">The section refers to "a particular judicial office". It is worded in this way in order to distinguish between the office held by an applicant who is already an officeholder and the new office to which the vacancy applies.

Section 11(8)(a) provides that persons such as consultants and advisers can be contracted or appointed to "advise and assist the Commission in its consideration of applicants at a preliminary stage in the course of the selection procedures". Section 11(8)(b) refers to the provision of an "an evaluation or an assessment of an applicant’s suitability for appointment that would assist the Commission in making any decision in the course of carrying out those procedures". Is it intended that outside bodies, advisers, consultants or other persons covered under section 11(8), will be carrying out evaluations of serving members of the Judiciary?</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I move amendment No. 97da:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_321">In page 34, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_322"><b>“53. </b>No statement under this Part shall provide for the interviewing of any applicant who is a serving judge in the Superior Courts in respect of any application to the Commission by him or her in respect of any vacancy in a judicial office in any of those courts.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I want to make clear that serving judges in the superior courts should not be interviewed by the commission in respect of any vacancy for a judicial office in any of those courts. This is a matter of fundamental importance to me. As I have said on a number of occasions, and I do not want to unduly emphasise or be repetitive in respect of this, every member of the High Court is <i>ex officio</i> capable of functioning, at the invitation of the President of the Court of Appeal, as an ordinary member of that court and is capable of being asked by the Chief Justice to serve on the Supreme Court. One is <i>ex officio </i>qualified to serve, if invited, as an ordinary member of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court if one is a member of the High Court. One's appointment to the High Court carries with it the obligation on the part of the Government that chooses one in the first place not to appoint somebody who would not be suitable to serve in the Court of Appeal or in the Supreme Court because, under the law, any person who is a High Court judge may, if invited by the President of the Court of Appeal or the Chief Justice, serve in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court as an ordinary temporary member of that court for any particular case. It follows as a matter of law and logic, in my view, that one is already deemed suitable to be a Court of Appeal member or a Supreme Court member to determine any particular case.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">That raises the very obvious question of what kind of questions one could be asked by a committee charged with interviewing applicants that would be in any way relevant to the outcome of the deliberations of the judicial appointments commission. What subjects could it discuss with them? One thing it cannot discuss with a candidate is what one's attitudes are to matters legal. We will deal with that in a subsequent amendment. What can it ask a candidate about? Can it ask about one's background? One's background is irrelevant. One is already a member of the High Court. What possible subject could there be at one of those so-called interviews of a judge? Can it ask whether one plays golf and what is one's handicap?</p>

          <p eId="para_340">What kind of questions would it be proper for an interview committee to put to a serving judge? That is the reason I have at all times opposed the idea of requiring serving judges to go through the evaluation procedures this Bill proposes. I would like to hear, if somebody could tell me in the course of the next 40 minutes, what kind of questions could be put by way of interview to serving judges that would assist the commission in determining whether to rank them among themselves or alternatively to prefer them or not to a non-judicial applicant. I do not believe there are any questions or topics that are in the remotest way relevant. It would be bad enough if one asked them as part of the application process to do a little essay about why they should be appointed, but what sense would there be if one starts to interview them on their attitudes to social issues or ideological views or trying to probe them to see if they came from a fee-paying school or a non-fee paying school with a view to getting diversity on the Bench? What sense is there to any of that? In any event it would be information that would be available from their curriculum vitae, which I presume would have already had to accompany their application.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> I appeal in particular to Senators Conway and Noone to tell me what questions they believe could be lawfully, correctly and appropriately put to a woman member of the High Court as to why she should be made a member of the Court of Appeal. Let us remember that under the daft procedures of this Bill so far, there has to be a majority of lay people on the interview committees. What question could they possibly ask an applicant?</p>

          <p eId="para_346">Following on from my colleague's contribution, assuming we find questions, those questions would have to have a marking scheme associated with them in order to be able to list the best answers from the worst answers. I find the whole thing unbelievable at this stage. Somebody will have to draft the questions and, as Senator McDowell said, what questions will we ask and how do we decide? Senator McDowell adverted to the judge who gets through a lot of case work very quickly versus the judge who takes a lot of time over cases and reserves judgment quite a lot. At the end of the day is one less productive than the other? Are we measuring them by the speed at which they can drive cases through the courts? Finding questions that would not be biased in some way is going to be extremely difficult. From what I can see, having found the questions, finding a marking scheme that allows one to mark the responses to those questions in order to prioritise people would become a total and utter nonsense. I am very interested to hear the answers to Senator McDowell's questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">The idea of interviewing a judge of the superior court is completely redundant. It has already been decided that he or she is qualified because he or she is able to sit on the Supreme Court. They are automatically deemed to be qualified. My colleague, Senator McDowell, asked my two Fine Gael colleagues what the questions should be. I think that question would be more appropriate-----</p>

          <p eId="para_354">Yes, that is just what I was going to say. I have the greatest of pleasure in agreeing with Senator Noone. I think that the question would be more appropriately directed at the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> If the interview committee decides that a judge is unfit to be in the Supreme Court, does that mean that he or she can never sit again? How could an unfit person sit in the Supreme Court? The thing is absolutely mad. One finds somebody is unqualified and then he or she happily goes back to sit in the Supreme Court as if nothing had happened. It is a complete and utter nonsense and I imagine the Minister knows it.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">One cannot possibly ask them those questions because of their independence. All of this brings us back to the fundamental point that serving judges in the superior courts should not be put through a process which ignores the fact that they are already deemed by law to be suitable to carry out the functions in respect of which they are applying to be considered for appointment by the President. The idea of holding interviews for such persons is redundant.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> In dealing with the previous section the Minister seemed to imply that the procedures committee might recommend to the commission that there not be interviews at all, but I am not sure whether that is what he is saying. If it is the case - this is the point on which I did not want to prolong the debate on the previous section - it is for the Houses of the Oireachtas, not the commission, to decide that issue. If it is to be the law that judges will be exempt from having to attend an interview, it is for us to decide that issue. It is not for an independent commission to decide that it will be done one way for a while and that we will then change the pattern and go back using to another way because we prefer live interviews. It is for the Houses of the Oireachtas to decide the appropriate procedure to be used or, if they are so persuaded, that there should be no interviews for serving members of the superior courts because holding them would serve no useful function.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">As my colleague said, where a judge is interviewed for the first time before he or she is appointed to a superior court - he or she may make it to Chief Justice - his or her organisational skills will be so important. How are those organisational skills to be tested at the point of entry if judges are not to be interviewed as they move along? We are back to the questions an individual should be asked. In over 40 years at work I have never met anybody who wants to move into a promotional position who has said he or she wants to be interviewed because there are things he or she wants to say. At that stage one's record speaks for itself. Why would any judge of the High Court want to go through an interview process to be appointed to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court? Why would a judge want to put himself or herself through it? He or she has already been through a selection process and appointed. Why would he or she say, "Hang on a minute; I want to do an interview. I want all of those in the commission to know what a wonderful person I am and about my membership of the GAA," and whatever else Senator McDowell was talking about. I cannot see the rationale behind it. I would like Senator Noone to explain what exactly she sees that is going on.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">The Senator had no difficulty with the principle of being interviewed. However, he has a huge problem with a sitting judge, in applying for what might be described as a "promotion", being interviewed. Looking at other jurisdictions, there is a facility which allows such an interview to take place, for example, in Scotland. If one looks at the current judicial appointments board system, there is provision for holding interviews. What we are doing is facilitating the commission in holding interviews in the same way we facilate the holding of interviews under the current judicial appointments board system.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> As far as sitting judges are concerned, I have said on numerous occasions that I intend to revisit the means by which we arrive at selecting those to be appointed to the three most senior posts of Chief Justice, President of the High Court and President of the Court of Appeal. I have indicated this time out of number, but I have not been able to do it because we have not yet reached Report Stage. In fact, I was hoping we would complete Part 8 of the Bill today and that we could get to Part 9 and complete other matters on Thursday in order that we would then have the remainder of the session to complete Report Stage. Perhaps we might be able do so within the next two weeks. That is still my intention and I am asking for the co-operation of Senators in that regard. I will come back on Report Stage with a formula to be used in selecting the persons to be appointed to fill the three most senior positions. Senator McDowell mentioned the positions of president. In fact, only today, the Government approved the appointment of the successors to the current President of the Circuit Court, Mr. Justice Raymond Groarke, and the current President of the District Court, Judge Rosemary Horgan. An advisory group to the Government, comprising the Attorney General, an individual from the Top Level Appointments Committee and a senior experienced expert judge, held a series of meetings. Having sought expressions of interest and placed an advertisement in the national newspapers, it duly recommended to the Government a number of names, from which it ultimately made a selection. I intend to propose a similar formula on Report Stage. In the meantime, I decline to accept the amendment which goes too far. Nobody is mandating the holding of interviews; rather, as happens in similar jurisdictions, there may be provision for the holding of interviews should the commission deem it to be appropriate in the circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">The Minister has stated I have consistently argued that sitting members of the superior courts should not be obliged to go through an interview process or to the commission. That is my view. The Minister then states he is considering an amendment under which at least the three most senior positions would be exempt from the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Does that hint at ordinary members of the Supreme Court also being included? Does this "at least" mean that anything more than "at most" those three positions should be the subject of a different procedure?</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> The Minister also states that he has been precluded from putting forward his ideas for section 44 as a result of the length of this debate. Alas, nothing could be further from the truth. He has at all times - as have I and other Members of this House - had the right to table amendments at any point during the past year. However, he is refusing to so until Committee Stage is disposed of. That is his choice. What he is attempting to do is to say that he has somehow been prevented from indicating his position on this matter as a result of the length of this debate, whereas he could certainly have tabled his amendment to section 44. The matter was well signalled in advance when we dealt with it and there is nothing stopping him from circulating his proposed text for section 44. That text would have been of assistance to many of us when we dealt with the other sections that refer to people appointed under section 44, particularly as we do not know the Minister's intentions in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> I wish to place on record the fact that it is not correct to state that the Minister has been precluded in any way from indicating his proposed arrangements for the three presidencies of the superior courts.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">The Minister further states that at least those three positions will be dealt with by means of an amendment from him. Will it be no more than those three positions? We are being deliberately kept in the dark on that issue. I have stated again and again that I see no reason whatsoever for the commission having any function in determining who becomes an ordinary member of the Supreme Court. Put simply, this is a matter for the Executive. It is also a matter to be decided on the basis of criteria which the commission is not entitled to take into account. How many times have I said that? The commission is not entitled to state, "Mr. Justice McDowell is a liberal and we recommend him on that basis" or "Mr. Justice McDowell is a conservative and we recommend him on that basis." That is <i>ultra vires</i> of the commission and the statutory scheme but those are precisely the criteria by which the Supreme Court would decide whether it wanted me to serve in the Supreme Court if I was in the High Court or the Court of Appeal. What would my attitude be to personal injuries or to matters of European and Irish law where they conflict? Those are the issues the Government should take into account when it is composing the membership of the Supreme Court and they are the precise issues about which the commission cannot ask questions or form a judgment. In actuality, it is not even suited to forming a judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> This applies not merely to the lay members of the commission, it also applies to the members of the Judiciary who will serve on this proposed commission. It is none of their business whether the State decides to appoint another liberal or another conservative to the Supreme Court. It is for this reason that I have championed the idea that the so called promotion - I do not like that word - of people to the higher courts among the superior courts is exclusively a matter for the Executive, having taken the advice of the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice and Equality and anybody else from whom it wishes to take advice and engaged in its own consideration, to deal with. It is nobody else's business whether the Executive decides to appoint a liberal or a conservative to the Supreme Court. Nobody else has a legitimate voice to express in respect of that matter. Nobody else is <i>ex officio</i>. The Chief Justice or the other members of the commission cannot be told to-----</p>

          <p eId="para_442">Yes. It is not open to the Chief Justice, as a functioning member of this commission - if it is ever established - to state that he or she is opposed to an appointment or does not favour a particular judge because he or she is a conservative or a liberal. That is and always has been the fundamental flaw with this legislation. That is why, when we raised the issue of what useful purpose an interview could serve, we concluded that it could only be to give the non-legal members of the commission an opportunity to eye these people up and form superficial conclusions about them in the course of conversation. It serves no useful function whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> The Courts and Courts Officers Act 2002 was enacted by the outgoing Government of the day in the wake of the controversy surrounding the Reynolds-Spring coalition due to a judicial appointment. That Act states that where somebody is already a judge, there is no need for him or her to have anything to do with the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. The implication is that these people are already qualified and should not be the subject of any requirement to make applications to an outside body to determine whether they should be recommended for particular positions. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board legislation specifically provides for interviews. The board has always had that opportunity to interview people who it does not know. The one thing the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was at least acknowledged by its very title to be, was purely advisory in nature. It it has been a constant undertone to the political debate surrounding the legislation before us that it is more than advisory and that it is intended to produce particular results and to put before the Government choices which are embarrassing not to endorse.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I have listened carefully to the debate. I have listened to the Minister and Senators Conway and Noone and I note that none of them has come forward with any useful purpose that an interview, as opposed to a CV, could serve. I note the provisions in the Bill which state that a record should be kept of every interview. I presume that is with a view to ensuring that there is equality of treatment for interviewees. Otherwise, I cannot see what particular purpose would be served by preserving the marking scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> I do not believe there is an analogy between a competitive process such as that relating to Top Level Appointments Commission, TLAC, appointments in the Civil Service or to the appointment of CEOs of vocational educational bodies and the appointment of somebody to be an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I see no analogy whatsoever between the two. There is an absolute distinction in constitutional terms, and the Cabinet is under no obligation to conduct its duty of advising the President by reference to any particular statutory framework. I have made that point again and again. The Cabinet is free to appoint people from the serving Judiciary to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, and is obliged to do so in accordance with its own judgment. It can take advice from anybody it wants but it must, in the last analysis, be free to decide, for example, that it wants liberals rather than conservatives, more women rather than fewer women, more men rather than fewer men, or anything else. That is entirely the constitutional prerogative of the Executive and it is not capable of being determined from the outside by legislation. I am disappointed that, in the absence of any explanation as to what useful purpose could be served by an interview process, we are failing to take the obvious step, which is to excuse sitting members of the superior courts, all of whom are capable of functioning in all of those courts as a matter of law, from submitting themselves to an interview process.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> I have one final issue to raise, which the Minister referred to on a previous occasion. Under the Government's original Bill, the shortlist of three was supposed to simply set out three names. It was an Opposition amendment which inserted the provision about ranking the candidates in terms of preference. I did not have an opportunity to check the Dáil record, so I do not know whether the Minister opposed or accepted that amendment on Committee Stage. It is now being put forward as a feature of the Bill which answers some of the criticisms of it. Is this a road to Damascus type of conversion to the ordering of candidates in terms of the commission's preference?</p>

          <p eId="para_480">The purpose of this amendment is to include those organisations which carry on gambling and betting online, by telephone, through television sets, via radio and by way of other types of electronic betting. I have received legal advice that the Bill as drafted would make promotion of all gambling without a gaming permit illegal. As the definition of gaming in the Bill is not limited in its scope and clearly extends to any gaming activity, whether land based or via private members' clubs, retail bookmakers or online, the effect would be to make online gambling and retail bookmakers illegal. Will the Minister comment on that legal advice?</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> As I said, the amendment seeks to bring online operators under the remit of the regulations that will apply to terrestrial betting. The Minister accepts that the online system now accounts for a much larger share of betting in this country than was the case in the past. Indeed, recent studies show that housewives and househusbands who are at home all day are spending fortunes online.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">One cannot switch on a television set after 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. without being enticed to get involved in bingo, roulette and all sorts of gambling. In 2015, when I first spoke on gambling in this House in the previous Seanad, I made the point that it had gotten out of control online. There was no control mechanism. I introduced amendments providing for time limits so that a user could not be online for longer than, say, an hour. I sought Government health warnings on betting slips and other measures. Every Senator in this House spoke in favour of the amendments I brought forward but they were voted down. I am still unable to rationalise that. </p>
          <p eId="para_483"> I am trying to make sure that everybody involved in gaming or gambling is brought under the same umbrella and are all subject to the control of the Minister of the day or of the legislation. The amendment seeks to include the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_484">Betting Act 1931;</p>

          <p eId="para_493"> The Minister of State and I have discussed this many times and I know he is deeply concerned about it. With the rate at which technology is moving forward, God knows where we will be in five years. We hear the horror stories of people waking up in the middle of the night, taking a smartphone out from under the pillow and using it for gaming and gambling. That is what we are trying to address here. I will leave it at that and see what the Minister of State's response is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2019-06-11T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_494">I am happy to second Senator Craughwell's amendment. There are one or two points to which I want to draw the Minister of State's attention. I was coming over to this House from my other place of work and in Cuffe Street I found myself sitting behind a van. I will not use names because I do not want to abuse my position. It was from a city outside of Dublin. The name of the business included the word "casino" and it had a .ie web address. The back of the van advertised slots, roulette, poker, jackpot and multigames and featured a huge picture of a roulette wheel which covered both doors. Two things occurred to me when I saw that van. First, it shows how flagrant the abuse of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 is. On the back of the van was geographical information referring to Athy, Carlow, Cork, Dublin, Mallow, Naas, Waterford and Wexford. It occurred to me that to the best of my knowledge, the District Court has authorised gaming to be carried on by way of machines in none of those places. As such, the reference to slots was strange.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> Senator Norris and I have remarked to each other that in Dublin the number of casinos featuring gaming machines has exploded. This activity is flagrant and takes place right before the eyes of the public. Even under the existing law, all of the machines in question are liable to be seized and removed by members of An Garda Síochána in my view. Huge money must be made from them. In England there has been debate about fixed-odds betting terminals and setting maximum stakes for them, which has been the subject of controversy. Their availability in so many places in England is frightening. I thought we had a law which prohibited all of that. I wonder what the Garda Commissioner, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Justice and Equality is going to do to enforce the law and close these places down. As far as I can recall, in the last 20 years Dublin City Council has never adopted a resolution which would permit such places to operate in the city. I do not believe that Cork, Mallow, Athy, Naas, Wexford or Waterford have adopted resolutions to that effect either. However, all of these operations seem to be carried on illegally and flagrantly, such that this multicoloured van with a sophisticated paint scheme was driving through our streets, clearly servicing such bodies in several locations where it is a criminal offence to operate slot machines and gaming arcades of the kind in question. </p>
          <p eId="para_496"> I support this Bill and I oppose the unsuccessful efforts to amend it to make more people victims to the undoubtedly addictive nature of gaming machines. I fully recognise that what Senator Craughwell has said to the House is correct. A Sky TV customer cannot fail to be struck by the vast amount of advertising of various bingo and online roulette games which seem to be permissible in the UK. My own experience is this. I have no particular objection to controlled online gambling on horse racing or football matches if it enhances the pleasure that football and racing fans get from those sports, which appears to be the case. However, I strongly object to a situation where we have established a law giving members of local authorities the right to determine whether gaming machines should be permitted to operate in their functional areas and that law is utterly ignored and trampled upon by people who must be making a fortune from doing so, while the powers of An Garda Síochána in respect of such machines simply are not enforced. </p>
          <p eId="para_497"> I do not want to comment on it, but I know this has come before the courts in recent times. It has been a long time since this became apparent. I regret to say that in some cases, some members of the district Judiciary have been codded by people claiming to have licences from the Revenue Commissioners in circumstances where no such licences could or should be made available because the local authority had made no resolution under the relevant part of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. Whatever the case is, I wish this Bill every fair passage and I ask the Minister of State to take Senator Craughwell's point on board.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy David Stanton)<recordedTime time="2019-06-11T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_498">I am a bit surprised that this amendment has been proposed. I do not recall the amendment being proposed or even discussed on Committee Stage. Normally it would be raised on Committee Stage and would then be debated on Report Stage. I am a bit perplexed by that.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> I recall some discussion, not all of it approving, of the fact that gambling is increasingly moving online from traditional land-based manifestations. This brings significant regulatory challenges that must be addressed in our proposed major reform. This is not a minor matter, as colleagues will surely agree. It is a major issue. We are talking about establishing a totally independent regulator, as has been done in other jurisdictions, not an office in the Department of Justice and Equality. That regulator could employ up to 120 people with various skills and would cost a large amount of money to establish. This is serious business. The legislation to make it happen, on which we are working at the moment, is quite complex. However, we can all appreciate that Senators in 1956 would not have foreseen the advent of the Internet - television was then in its infancy - or the provision of gaming services by remote means.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The gaming envisaged was local in nature and taking place in carnivals, shows, circuses and so on, and through local lotteries and bingo. Licensed gaming by machines was provided under certain conditions in amusement halls for minimal stakes and prizes. One of the provisions of the Bill is to increase those amounts to more sensible levels. I am not, however, providing for a radical move away from the architecture of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. As I stated on Second and Committee Stages, the Bill seeks to address certain deficiencies with regard to the conduct of gaming and lottery activities, currently comprehended by and regulated under the 1956 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> The Bill proposes a number of interim reform measures for the licensing and regulation of gaming and lottery activities concerned by the 1956 Act, pending the development of comprehensive reform of gambling laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> There is no proposal in this Bill to repeal sections 12 and 13 to end local authority involvement in passing resolutions to permit gaming in their area. That is not here even though I note that some Senators would like to include it. I am, however, not proposing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Senators will note the recommendations contained in the Report of the Working Group on the Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling, approved by Government on 20 March of this year, would transfer all future responsibility for licensing of all forms of gaming to a new gambling regulatory authority. At that time, and with new regulations in place, the involvement of the local authorities and other bodies currently concerned would cease. That is what we will bring forward in the future, but that is not here now.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">We will debate that provision at that time. I would be interested to hear what colleagues have to say about it, but at that time. That is not what we are doing here.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> It would appear that the thrust of the Senators’ amendment, and having regard to other proposed amendments ruled not in order, would effectively allow a free-for-all approach to online gaming. This is what the proposed amendments would do. The proposed widening of the scope of the 1956 Act at this point to enable persons to engage in remote gaming would happen in advance of any modern regulatory reform. We have to be careful to not open the door at this stage. The playing of gaming machines by remote means would totally undermine the provisions of the 1956 Act, which only provides for their physical playing in a licensed gaming or amusement hall, in areas where a local authority resolution allowing gaming is in force. There is no licensing pathway for remote gaming under the 1956 Act and I would be concerned about the lack of regulatory oversight that is envisaged by the Senators, particularly with regard to player protection, identification of problem gamblers, prevention of underage gambling and other issues. The proposed new gambling regulatory authority upon its establishment will deal with the licensing and regulation of gambling of all kinds, including remote gambling. I suggest that we refrain from considering any extension of the provisions of the 1956 Act to encompass remote gaming in the absence of the establishment of such a dedicated regulatory authority for gambling.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> I now turn to the issue of the drafting of the Bill, and I know that Senator McDowell will appreciate this. The Senators’ proposed insertions in the Bill would create uncertainty as the terms sought to be included do not appear anywhere in the text of the Bill or of the 1956 Act. The proposed amendments would include definitions but they do not do anything or appear anywhere else in the legislation, and therefore would not have any impact, so why do it? What would be the point? I am not in a position to accept the Senators’ amendment. It would not assist in the limited reform of the 1956 Act and might risk unintended consequences. I appreciate the Senators' sincerity and real interest in this issue but I do not believe this is the way to do it. I ask them to consider withdrawing the amendment at this time. We will be back with the major reforms at a later stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">I appreciate the Minister of State's bona fides on this. I am trying to achieve a level playing pitch for terrestrial and the extra-terrestrial organisations. When we discuss the various gaming houses in town there will be a migration from organisations where human beings are watching what is happening and able to intervene where they see compulsive gambling and gaming. Consider the reports from Paddy Power that show that in 2014, for example, some 77% of its profits were made online. This is what I am trying to do. There are 45,000 people in Ireland who are addicted to gambling. I believe the Minister of State is saying that he intends to come back to deal with this in a further Bill at a later stage. Will the Minister of State guarantee that he will not impact negatively on those organisations that operate in Dublin today? I do not refer to the slot machine guys who operate outside the law. I refer to the various clubs that operate within the law in the State. Are they going to be protected in this scenario? They have some concerns over and above the issues I have expressed here. We have to deal with the online concerns. The Minister of State has admitted this. Perhaps this is not the place to do it but before I make up my mind whether to press the amendment or not, will the Minister of State indicate how soon it will be before we find a solution?</p>

          <p eId="para_509">Private members' clubs are currently not covered by the law. We know this. There is no intention in the proposals being brought forward by this Bill to have any impact on those clubs. That is not the intention. Beyond that, the Senator will be aware that I have been very open on the intention of establishing a regulator. I have changed that from being an office in the Department of Justice and Equality to being an independent regulator. I beefed up the proposal and gained Government approval. We had a year long inter-departmental working group, which looked at every aspect of this. I can assure the Senators that it is extraordinarily complicated, and Senator McDowell has already alluded to that. It is not easy. As soon as that report was cleared by Government I published it so everyone could have sight of it, read it and give us feedback on it. We had an open day at Farmleigh House recently to which all the interested groups were invited, and they did attend. I believe there were 120 people there. We held a one day seminar on this issue. The work goes on. We are now updating the 2013 heads of the Bill so we can bring forward the legislation, hopefully in the autumn, for the consideration of the Houses and establish it. I reiterate that the definitions the Senator's amendment proposes to insert into the Bill do not appear anywhere else in the text of the Bill or the 1956 Act. With respect, those definitions would not do anything but they may cause uncertainty. They will not have any impact anywhere when they are not referenced anywhere else in the legislation. I hope the Senator can accept my bona fides here. Again, the Senator will be aware that when we bring forward legislation to the Houses in the autumn, Senators - and the Deputies in the other House - can amend and change and make suggestions, to which I am very open. Any advice we can get on this will be welcome at that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_527">We held an extensive debate on the issue then. As I stated then, I have no function in regard to the national lottery, its regulation or licensing. That is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the National Lottery Act 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">In that Act, the Minister did not provide for any prohibition on bookmakers, be they land based or remote, on offering bets on any or all of the numbers drawn in the national lottery each week. I must take my guidance in this matter from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who very recently reiterated his position opposing this proposal. There appears to be no particular evidence that betting on lottery numbers is undermining funding for good causes currently or that it threatens the profitability of the national lottery operator in the long term, which, I must point out, is now a private company. There is no evidence to show this other betting is having any impact on the good causes or the profitability of the private company.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Senator Mark Daly in his Committee Stage contribution made comments to the effect that betting on lottery numbers leads to a loss of revenue to the Exchequer with no tax paid on such bets. That is not correct. Licensed online and remote bookmakers offering bets on lottery numbers and all licensed Irish betting shops must pay tax on every bet that they take. They must pay the current necessary licence fee. Bookmakers' shops also contribute to the Exchequer by providing many jobs in towns and villages all over Ireland. The product offered in betting shops also differs. Bookmakers offer bets on one, two, three, four or five numbers being drawn, which is not possible with the national lottery. I further understand that bookmakers do not offer bets on the whole six or seven numbers, as the national lottery does. Online operators offer bets on the outcome of the national lottery, Euromillions and other lotteries, with players having to choose the corresponding numbers relating to those draws. The product offered in betting shops differs, where bookmakers offer bets on one, two, three, four or five numbers being drawn. In terms of cost to customers, bookmakers accept bets of 0.05 cent and upwards whereas the national lottery minimum stake is €5 for two lines without the plus option. The essence of the Senator's proposal appears to be to enhance the monopoly position of the private operator of the national lottery by ending the possibility for licensed bookmakers, land based and remote, to offer bets on the outcome of the Irish national lottery draws. The Senator's proposals would, however, allow offered bets by licensed land based or online bookmakers on any other lottery, just not the Irish one.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> I expressed a concern on Committee Stage that accepting this amendment might lead to further demands from the national lottery, perhaps seeking to prohibit the local lotteries that support our sports clubs and community organisations. A similar argument to that made by the Senator could be made that they also impact on the turnover of the national lottery. The local football, rugby or hurling club that has a lottery could be said to impact on the national lottery. For the reasons I have outlined, the Government is not in a position to support this proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">I totally get where Senator Clifford-Lee is coming from with this amendment. The national lottery's relationship with the people of Ireland is twofold. In the first instance, hundreds of thousands of people play the lotto every week who would not dream of going into a betting shop and do not bet online. Practically every old age pensioner in the country plays the lotto. The second point is that there is not a town or village in the country that has not benefitted from national lottery funding since its inception in 1986 under the late Jim Mitchell, who was communications Minister at the time. I spoke against the privatisation of the national lottery in the previous term. Unfortunately, the economic circumstances back then were of a nature that this was an opportunity to raise €400 million or €500 million in one go. The Government in its wisdom went for it. I did not agree with it. I did not believe the national lottery should have been handed over to a private company. It is interesting to hear the Minister of State speak about the private company that is running the national lottery and giving it a competitive advantage over others. Had it not been privatised we would not be talking about it as a private company but that is neither here nor there. We are where we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> I share the sentiments expressed by Senator Clifford-Lee in her amendment but I also see logic of the Minister of State's position in terms of giving a company that was privatised a competitive advantage over others.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">Senator Clifford-Lee's amendment, in subsection (4), defines "lottery gain" as having the meaning given to the term under the National Lottery Act 2013. That is not confined to national lottery gains. It is a generic description of what amounts to a lottery gain and it does not have to be run by the national lottery. In fairness to the Senator, her amendment would cover non-national lotteries.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">The Minister of State has indicated that in the proposed new legislation on gambling regulation the Government intends to remove from local authorities any function in respect of whether gaming machines operate in their jurisdiction.

          <p eId="para_568">I agree with Senator McDowell on that point, as I indicated on Second or Committee Stage. We cannot take away the local knowledge. I do not think that is the import of what the Minister of State intends to do. Rather than take power away from local government, we should be retaining certain functions for local government. In his earlier contribution Senator McDowell spoke about the proliferation of casinos and gaming machines in Dublin. The same could be said of other parts of the country, in particular around Cork city. I appeal to the Minister of State, and I am not saying that because I am a Member of this House or looking to keep councillors happy, but because this is genuinely important. When we were campaigning for the mayoral election in the plebiscite we talked about keeping power local and having accountability and transparency at local level. I earnestly believe that in the context of this Bill, the Minister of State has done a supreme job both in his previous incarnation as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and now as a Minister of State in this area. He deserves gargantuan praise and credit for what he has done, how he has steered this through and managed to bring a lot of people together.
