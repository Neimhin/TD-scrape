#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I welcome Dr. Seán Healy, director, Sr. Brigid Reynolds, director, and Ms Michelle Murphy, research and policy analyst, Social Justice Ireland.By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person(s) or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.I now invite Dr. Healy to make his presentation on budget 2012, the possible impact on the poor of current developments in the socioeconomic situation and implications for Government policy.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to meet with the joint committee.  I welcome the number of members in attendance, which is always a positive sign for witnesses.Social Justice Ireland is an organisation of individuals and organisations.  Approximately 60 organisations are members of Social Justice Ireland, all of whom are committed to the building of a just society wherein human rights are respected, human dignity is protected, human development is facilitated and the environment is respected and protected.  A copy of our brief has been circulated to the joint committee.  It is a 28 page presentation which members will be glad to note I do not intend to read.  As we have been allocated only five minutes to make a presentation we will tailor our opening remarks to that.  It is obviously not possible to present in a five minute presentation even a general outline of what we are doing.  However, we will highlight some issues and then respond to any issues on which members would like further information.Social Justice Ireland is of the view that Government has choices, even in these difficult times.  While we have concerns about the parameters within which Government is working, in terms of the bail out, targets and so on, we have prepared this presentation based on Government parameters.  The bottom line for us in preparing this presentation was how to produce a set of proposals, fully costed, that would reduce borrowing by €3.8 billion in 2012.  That is what we have done.As I stated, the Government has choices.  We believe it is possible to reduce borrowing by €3.8 billion and still protect the poor and vulnerable.  In this regard, we would do a number of different things from those proposed by the Government.  First, we would provide for a different ratio between tax increases and cuts to services.  In particular, we would increase overall taxation, but not income tax, by €2 for every €1 cut in services, which is not quite the reverse but almost a full reversal of what Government is proposing.  When talking about taxation in this context we are talking about all taxes, local charges and social insurance.  The reason we would come at it from this angle is that Ireland is one of the lowest total tax take countries in the western world.In the European Union, depending on which set of data one considers, only two or three of its 27 member states take a lower proportion of their GDP in total tax than does Ireland, as understood in that broad measure.  Were one to take the approach we suggest, that is, a ratio of tax increases to service cuts of 2:1, and do this through 2015, Ireland still would be a low tax country in 2015.  EUROSTAT's benchmark is that a country with less than 35% of GDP in tax is a low tax country.  This is the actual measurement used to measure what is a low tax country.  We have worked out that were Ireland to continue with such an approach of using a ratio of 2:1, less than 35% of its GDP would be going on tax, in the broad sense we have described, in 2015.In pages 24 and 25 of the submission, we have spelled out in detail the proposals regarding all the various expenditure changes and reductions, as well as all the tax changes.  For example, we would introduce an anti-bad nutrition tax and would impose a tax of one third of one cent on each text message sent.  Similarly, we would increase taxation on gambling by €40 million and would introduce a levy, not an increased tax, of 2.5% on corporate profits.  The difference between a tax and a levy in this context is that the latter melts away when we return to a balanced context again after a few years.  The submission also lists a number of other issues.We have made a few suggestions on the expenditure side.  As my time is limited, I will highlight one point in particular, namely, our proposal to create 100,000 part-time jobs for people who are long-term unemployed.  This would reduce the numbers of the long-term unemployed by approximately two thirds.  At present, they comprise close to 8% of the total labour force.  More than half of those who are unemployed have been so for more than a year and therefore are designated as being long-term unemployed.  Social Justice Ireland thinks there is a serious danger that a major cohort in the middle of this group will be completely missed.  On one end of the spectrum, people are just coming in who have low skills or have no experience of the labour market.  This group is being intensively challenged in a variety of ways by Government policy to upskill or to become involved in the labour market and so on.  While this is fine, the problem is such people form only a relatively small proportion of all those who are long-term unemployed.  We think there is an enormous number of people who are long-term unemployed, who have skills and who wish to use them.  Moreover, they did use such skills up to a few years ago when they had the opportunity to so do.Social Justice Ireland proposes that the Government should create a new programme, based on a programme we piloted between 1994 and 1997, called the part-time job opportunities programme.  It was taken into the mainstream by the Government in 1997 and the Minister responsible for so doing was Deputy Richard Bruton.  I note his Minister of State at the time was Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  They took it into the mainstream in 1997 and a couple of years later, the programme had melted away.  This is as programmes of this nature should do, because the economy had recovered.  There were jobs in the marketplace which people took up and consequently, the programme simply melted away, which is as it should be.  Moreover, this is what would happen again under this programme.  Basically, the idea is that people would be offered jobs in either in the public sector, from the Department's own office right down to the library in the local village or town, or in the community and voluntary sectors.  People would be offered the hourly going rate for the job and would work the number of jobs required to get their social welfare benefits, plus €20.  This is the same arrangement that would apply, were they on a community employment programme.  They would be free for the rest of the week to take up another part-time job if they could get one.  If as a result they earned enough money to be in the tax net, they then would pay taxes like everyone else.  However, they would keep their social welfare benefits for the period during which they had a contract for this programme.This proposal is different from all existing schemes and would create part-time jobs.  It is a win-win-win situation.  There is a win for all those who would take up the positions and incidentally, it would be completely voluntary.  There also are wins for whatever organisations by which the participants are employed.  There is a win for the local community, which will have a service provided that had not been provided heretofore or that had ceased because of people being let go or whatever.  There also is a win for the households and families of the people themselves, because they maintain their skills and their participation in the labour force.  As a result, such people are job-ready when jobs become available in any form.  Finally, it also benefits the economy because when activity takes place, even without great gain, a kind of dynamism operates that generates other activity and this also is important within that process.Consequently, we strongly recommend that this proposal be implemented.  It would involve a relatively small amount of money and would have a huge impact.  Moreover, from the Government's point of view, it would have the dramatic effect of reducing long-term unemployment quite substantially.  It would be reduced by two thirds from its present level, which surely is the target of both the Government and the Opposition and even of the troika, the IMF and so on.  While the submission contains many other proposals, I will not outline them as I have not been given the time to so do.  However, I would be happy to deal with any question any member might raise.  If members seek elaboration on my comments or on any issue included in the aforementioned 28 pages, we would be more than glad to do so.  Incidentally, all costings provided here have been generated by the Government.  These are not costings we imagined or guessed or anything of that nature.  Any figures not produced by the Government were generated by reputable research that has been peer-reviewed and the numbers will stand up to any review.  I thank the Chairman.

To clarify the rule we have, as everyone has received the submission and has had a chance to read through it, it is better to have more time for a question and answer session than for a presentation.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Members have had the opportunity to hear presentations from Social Justice Ireland in the past and an important point it makes is there are choices to make.  It is important that as a Parliament, Members do not get into a corner by thinking no choices are available, as there are choices to make.  Sinn Féin supports the ratio of taxation to cuts mentioned and discussed by Dr. Healy, as well as in the submission.  The point that Ireland is a low-tax state when compared with our neighbours also is important and it is possible to achieve an efficient and competitive economy with a higher tax take.  The Nordic countries are examples in which this has been achieved with great success.  I am very attracted to the part-time job opportunities programme mentioned by Dr. Healy and have a couple of questions in that regard.  In what sectors does it best operate?  Approximately how much does Dr. Healy reckon it would cost the State?  When the programme operated in 1997, what benefits did it bring to the organisations for whom the individuals worked?  I refer to the type of productivity questions people might have in this regard etc.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The part-time job opportunities programme operated principally in the public, community and voluntary sectors but not in the private sector because of the obvious problem with deadweight, whereby people who already had paid jobs would be replaced by people in this context, which obviously would not be not acceptable.  The programme was only available to fill positions that had not been filled in the previous year.  This was to avoid the danger, even in the community, voluntary or State sectors, that people would be let go and replaced immediately by people from the long-term unemployed register.  The other issue is it was well received at the time by trade unions and so on, because the programme recognised the going rate for the job.  We had no problem in working out with both the Government and the trade unions what was the accepted going rate for the job.  That was what got paid, depending on whatever the jobs were, and there was an enormous range of jobs.As for the cost to the State, for each position one creates in the public sector, it would cost only €1,000.  It would cost the State €20 per week for 52 weeks of the year, because the social welfare money would be switched over to the Department, office, library, local authority or whatever body actually employs the person.  The participants work for that amount of money, plus €20 per week, which is the same amount of money people would receive, were they, for example, on a community employment programme.  However, in this context, such people work the number of hours required to get the social welfare payment, plus the €20 top-up, at the going hourly rate for the job.  For argument's sake, members should consider an example of a job that pays €15 per hour.  The social welfare payment rate for a single person is €188 and €20 on top of that amounts to €208.  One could divide €208 by 15, which is roughly the number of hours a person would work, somewhere between 13 and 14 hours a week.  That person would be free during the remainder of the week to take up another part-time job.  The person would pay tax on the money earned if he or she earned a sufficient amount to be brought into the tax net and would retain his or her social welfare benefit and entitlement to a medical card.  In terms of the cost to this programme to the Exchequer, there would be nothing added other than the €20 a week.  If a job were created in the public sector, it would not be necessary to put in place materials, grants, supervision grants and so on because the places these people would work already exist, whether in libraries, offices or elsewhere.  There would not be a difficulty in that context.We have discussed this matter with a number of Ministers.  We had an interesting discussion with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  He was positive about it and did not envisage any great problem with creating quite a number of these jobs in a variety of projects.  We thought that was positive.  We also discussed it with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government because there are many possibilities in that area.  He was also very positive about it.  We discussed it with the Minister for Social Protection who probably would have the main role in regard to this programme if it were rolled out.  She seemed positive about it and did not believe there would be a problem in the context of delivering it.  There might be resistance within the system but I suspect such resistance might be in the Department of Finance which might think such a programme would create jobs for life.  That is not what we propose.  We propose creating these jobs in transition until the economy recovers.  Instead of having people on the dole, signing on and getting their money, if they were prepared, on a voluntary basis, to take up these part-time jobs, our proposal is to let them do it.If the jobs were created in the community and voluntary sector, however, the necessary supports would have to be provided because that sector does not have the resources to cater for such a programme.  There has been a growing demand for the services provided by community and voluntary organisations and in terms of delivering them they are at bursting point.  Those organisations would have to be supplied with more support, as in the case of community employment placements but less support would be required in this case.In a period of 18 months 90,000 people could be employed in the public sector, many of them in local authorities, libraries and so on delivering local services and 10,000 could be employed in the community and voluntary sector.  The cost that would be involved would be small in the grand scheme of things.Sr. Brigid Reynolds will speak about the experiences of people who worked on such a programme and of its impact on communities.  She and I directed this type of programme from 1994 to 1997.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The experience was very good.  From the point of view of the people who got jobs, as one person said, "I have something to talk about when I go home in the evening".  The person had a job and it gave the person a great sense of being useful, contributing etc.  From the point of view of the community, many services were closed or the hours they were open were very reduced. Many libraries were almost closed at that time and I believe the same will happen again from what I have heard.That programme was the start of the provision of assistance in schools.  It was the first programme that examined the need for assisting children in the classroom and that later became special needs assistance provision.  This programme is where such provision began.What I found exciting about the programme was the creativity it released because people began to see possibilities.  We had some very interesting projects such as one in Tralee where the people started what has become an autumn festival, and Siamsa Tire from Galway helped them out.  The people on that programme realised they could extend the tourism season for a longer period into late October.  There were also places such as the school of music where people learned how to play instruments.  Those places got more people, people were taught music and there was even a person who taught people how to make fiddles.  Many people were involved in tourism projects in that people marked trails, climbed mountains and put down markers in different places of interest and wrote short histories about those places which involved a little research.  There were many projects in the area of health care, especially in the area of disabilities and helping to increase the dignity of people with disabilities.  Many creative projects were initiated because of the many skilled people involved in that programme, just as there are many skilled people unemployed now.From the point of experience, the programme was very positive and people had great experiences as a result of being part of it.

The growth in the number of people with skills presents opportunities in every community members represent.  For example, we are trying to develop a Boyne walk in County Meath, the full length of the river but we have come up against a wall due to the lack of manpower and funds but such a programme would provide an opportunity for the carrying out of that work.  Often when one puts forward an idea to politicians, they say it is great but it does not progress from there.  Does Dr. Healy believe he had real traction with the Ministers responsible or what more needs to be done to progress this idea?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	8	There are two issues involved.   One is that there is not an appreciation among some people of the economic value of such a programme.  Second, there is a fear confined, not totally but principally, to the Department of Finance that it would create public employment from which they could not row back when jobs come into the marketplace and it believes these people will become permanent public employees.  To deal with both issues, on the economic front, Sr. Brigid Reynolds talked about the experience in Tralee as one example where people created an additional festival to expand the tourism season.  One of the pilot areas was north Kerry and the people there came to us with a committee that had 11 working groups that were trying to develop this type of festival that would expand the tourism season.  We gave them one worker in each of the 11 working groups and suddenly they had a viable organisation that generated that festival, which is held to this day and has expanded the tourism season in north Kerry, particularly in Tralee and its environs.  It has had a positive economic impact.County Laois was another pilot area.  The Sliabh Bloom Mountains now have documented walks and guides and to this day there is an economic value from that project because such provision draws in the tourists. Finglas-Blanchardstown was another pilot area in which a centre was developed and it was able to obtain funding from private business sources to help develop the training capacity of a fairly substantial nature for people who wanted to top up their keyboard and software skills.  There has been an economic benefit from that which would not otherwise have been obtained.When people do these calculations they do not use dynamic economic models, rather they use a spreadsheet.  There is no dynamism in a spreadsheet that shows the cost of creating one position would be €1,000 per year but does not show the great benefit that would be gained from it.  One could spend €188 a week giving a payment to a person who is long-term unemployed who does not do any work, as such, but if one were to give the person another €20 a week, one could create something dynamic that would have obvious benefits including economic benefits.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I thank Dr. Healy for his introductory remarks.  I did not get an opportunity to read through his presentation in detail but some of the information on protection against child poverty etc., is compelling.  I am not sure if Dr. Healy would agree with me but I believe there must be a child poverty analysis of how the budget will impact on families and children.I am not necessarily convinced of the 2:1 ratio proposal as I believe there are more tax opportunities available than people realise.  There is no assets tax in this country, an issue we have consistently raised.  Other countries apply such a tax.  Assets could be earmarked for taxation.  Household wealth here increased by €45 billion in the past year and such wealth accounts for €319 billion.  That wealth could be taxed.  I agree with Dr. Healy that social welfare payments should not be touched, but at least €10 billion could be collected from an assets tax.   Year on year it would have a huge impact on protecting social welfare payments without going after people on the lower-end of the scale through taxation.  The information and facts are very impressive and I will read through it.  What do the witnesses think of the idea of an asset tax?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	10	We will deal with both issues, beginning with child poverty about which Ms Murphy will speak.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	11	At present, 218,000 children are at risk of poverty.  Updated figures are being released today but the number has increased by 35,000 in two years.  We see child poverty as part of household poverty and believe budgets need to be poverty-proofed with regard to households because if a household in poverty a child there will be in poverty.  Until such time as households can be brought out of poverty the issue of child poverty will not be addressed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I draw the committee's attention to what happened to working poor households in the most recent budget.  Households headed by a person with a job which were already in poverty were hit in six different ways, one of which, namely the reduction in the minimum wage, has been changed by the new Government.  However, the other five are still in place.  These households were brought into the tax net, the universal social charge was applied to them, service fees were increased or introduced for services which were previously free, and child benefit was reduced.  These are five different ways of taking money out of the pockets of the working poor and there is something profoundly wrong with this.  This is why we strongly support the idea of household analysis to show all of the impacts of budgetary decisions.  I am concerned that if it is approached in sections, whereby health, education, social welfare and housing are worked on separately there could be a huge cumulative negative impact on poor people and vulnerable households.With regard to an asset tax, we thought we would be doing well if we could get the Government to make reverses on tax issues.  There is certainly scope for a greater tax take on assets, as other countries have shown.  The bottom line is that each country has a welfare state agreement and various types of welfare states and social contracts exist; they may not be written down but they exist.  The Nordic countries are at the top end whereby everything is handled by the Government.  If one's child is ill one does not have to skip work because the state will step in.  If somebody does not have a job something will be created for the person, such as providing services.  The quid pro quo for this is that 45%, 47% or 48% of GDP is paid in taxation.  At the other end are countries with the opposite approach which keep taxes as low a percentage as possible of GDP, and as they do not have much income available they keep services and supports at a low level.  Ireland is in this category and only two EU member states, both of which were in the former USSR, take a lower percentage of GDP in tax than Ireland.  If we take such a low percentage of GDP in tax we do not have the money to improve welfare rates or services.We argue that the way to deal with this is straightforward.  Everybody in the political process should try to spell out what type of Ireland we want.  Where do we want Ireland to be in ten years time?  This is a good question to ask.  What should then be asked is what is required of Ireland in this context, how we get there, how will it be paid for and how will we divide up the provision of services and taxation between the private sector, the State sector and the community and voluntary sector.  We should try to generate debate on these issues so people have a sense of where we want to go in the coming decade and how we will get there.  If this framework was at the core of discussion we could have intelligent debate on levels of taxation and what constitutes fairness in this context.The previous Government's commission on taxation wrote a report which identified 111 tax breaks with 20 more for property, giving a total of 131.  It made recommendations on all of them and we support 130 of those 131 recommendations.  The report did not recommend scrapping all of them.  It stated some should be retained, others revised or reduced and others eliminated.  The recommendation we do not support is the idea of taxing child benefit.  If the other 130 recommendations were put in place we would have a much fairer tax system.  Income tax rates would not need to be increased but there would be substantial overall increases in taxation without placing Ireland in the super-tax bracket.  It would mean 80% of the benefit of a particular tax break would not go to the top 20%, which is what happens at present, and no tax break would be in place for which it was not known who benefited or what it cost, which was the case for 30 or 40 tax breaks which were in place when the commission reported.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	13	A €10 or €5 decrease in child benefit has been touted.  What is the view of Social Justice Ireland on this?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Social Justice Ireland believes there is no justification whatsoever for reducing child benefit in any form, either by reducing it, taxing it, means testing it or using vouchers.  It is a payment which is not adequate to look after a child and is made for all children.  Let us approach the perceived problem in a different way and I will give an example.  Forget poor households, because everybody is in favour of looking after them although in practice this does not happen for working poor households.My example is of two households side-by-side each comprising a couple with an income of €100,000.  They are taxed in exactly the same way and have the same amount of money in their pockets.  One of the households has two children and the other has none.  The household with the two children receives an additional €1,830 for each child giving a total of an extra €3,660.We do not deny the Government finds itself in a very difficult situation.  It must pay its way and reduce its borrowing.  In this case, the Government proposes to take away money from the household of four and leave the household of two with the money it has.  To us this seems to be perverse in the extreme.  We suggest leaving the money for the children with the children, and if extra money is required taking it from everyone with €100,000 if this is what it takes, or finding it another way such as through eliminating or reducing tax breaks which benefit only or principally the better off.  The idea that it is just to take away money from a child in this context does not stand up.
#MichaelMullins	unknown-#MichaelMullins-party	unknown-#MichaelMullins-dob	unknown-#MichaelMullins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Dr. Healy stated Social Justice Ireland rules out the idea of a voucher system being put in place but we must consider that significant amounts of money go through social welfare to households where children are still neglected.  This is not because there is insufficient income going into the households, it is due to how it is being used and spent.  In addition, there may be all sorts of social difficulties including drug abuse and alcoholism, so the children are still neglected.  Although it may impinge on people's civil rights, that whole area needs to be investigated to see how resources that are being channelled to families are actually spent.  I would know of many cases in my own town where children are being neglected, not because there is insufficient income but because it is being badly managed.  Perhaps Dr. Healy could comment on that at some stage.I noticed one or two interesting figures in Dr. Healy's submission.  He plans to raise €892 million by a 2.5% levy on the corporate sector.  He will be aware of the recent furore at EU level when a certain leader of a country attempted to interfere with our corporation tax rate.  Would this type of levy not do serious damage to the potential for future investment here and possibly scare off some of our multinationals who are creating significant levels of employment?Social Justice Ireland would save €445 million in student fees by having all students pay for their third level education, by organising loans which would be repaid after they complete their education.  I see a major flaw in that, however.  If small businesses and individuals cannot get loans from the banking sector here, how does Social Justice Ireland envisage students being in a position to do so?  The banking sector is unwilling to loan even to legitimate, viable businesses.I give Dr. Healy great credit for his efforts to raise additional taxation on the gambling sector, particularly Internet gambling.  I would even go for a higher figure if I had the opportunity to do so.  Internet gambling has a most unfair advantage over legitimate high street betting shops who are paying taxes.  One can gamble on the Internet tax free but it is an area that needs to be addressed and has huge potential.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I congratulate Social Justice Ireland for being a voice for the less well-off in society.  The current statistics are damning, as we are talking about 600,000 adults living in poverty and almost 200,000 children.  Many people in that group feel they do not have a voice and have been abandoned by the major political parties and most certainly by the trade union movement.  They are easy prey for cuts, which has been the case down through the years as there are not too many people to stand up on their behalf.  I am interested in SJI's jobs initiative and would like to know the exact responses it received from various Ministers.  I attended the SJI press conference a few months ago, and I make it a point to go to all SJI's press conferences.  Its proposals on jobs seems to be pragmatic.  With a number of amendments it could have the capacity to take people off the live register.  I would like to know what the Minister said about it.Dr. Healy has answered my question on child benefit.  It should not be means tested.  I have been a politician for a long time and I meet many women from various income groups who require that money for different reasons, as Dr. Healy knows.  This can be verified by the Combat Poverty Agency, MABS, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul and Social Justice Ireland.  It will be a disastrous situation if we reach a stage where we touch child benefit.I would like to hear Dr. Healy's views on corporation tax and the vast profits that are taken out of the country by multinationals.  One may debate cutting child benefit but if one mentions raising corporation tax one will be accused of driving investment out of Ireland.  I imagine that if one were to impose an extra 1% or 2% tax on big companies' profits they would hardly decide to leave.  I would like to hear Dr. Healy's views on that and whether he has made them known to the Government.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	17	We will divide the questions up between us, but I will deal with the corporation tax issue.  The furore about our corporation tax rate was, with due respect, caused mostly by the Government itself and vested interests who had a serious interest in protecting the good deal they have at the moment.  Why those interests would not protect themselves is no mystery, of course they will do so and try to keep the good situation they have.  In that context it is important to note a few things.  A great many corporations do not pay 12.5% in tax.  I would draw the committee's attention to a provision that was introduced not in the budget but in the Finance Act 2009, which might situate this somewhat.  There is a provision for a tax credit to be made available for companies that invested money in research and development, which people can make an argument for.  People have different views about it but it was provided.  However, there was an additional provision stating that if there was insufficient tax to benefit from the full value of the tax credit, then a cash repayment would be provided to the company.  That says to me that, in practice, the company is paying zero tax.  We therefore have a 12.5% rate but they are not paying any tax.  We are actually paying them back a bit - not on the taxes they paid, but on top of the profits they are already making on the basis that they have done some research and development in Ireland.  With due respect, there is an issue here that needs to be addressed.Many people seem to be under the impression that most, or all, companies pay 12.5% in corporation tax but many do not.  According to one study, the effective tax rate averages out at 11.5% or something of that nature.  However, last week there was a big song and dance by an eminent Irish businessman who runs a prominent airline.  He said that child benefit should be eliminated and described it as a subsidy for having sex.  He said he had four children himself but did not need this money and that is fair enough.  While I try not to support his company's public relations drives, which is what that was all about, I would be much more impressed if he was paying 12.5% tax on Ryanair's profits.  According to a recent report, however, I understand that he pays about 7% of his total profits in tax.  That is 7% more than the company I was talking about earlier.  I want to make the point, however, that Michael O'Leary pays his own taxes in Ireland, which a lot of major net worth people do not do.  He does and fair play to him.  I am not singling him out at all for any bad comment, it is just that he was in the media last week on this issue.  I would be much more impressed if there was a compulsory 12.5% tax on company profits that they had to pay.  I suspect we would then be in a different kind of situation as regards the tax revenue we get.The second point, however, is that even if we introduced a levy, it will melt away in a few years time.  It is interesting to note where that proposal came from originally.  It was adopted by Social Justice Ireland, we did not create it.  We got it from Michael Smurfit who is not a noted socialist.  Last year, he proposed that there should be a levy of 3% that could be paid for a number of years.  As long as the number of years was specified, he could see the corporate sector making that contribution towards helping Ireland to rescue itself from the serious situation we are in.  This does not sound like a very radical proposal if people such as Dr. Michael Smurfit are supporting it and I do not see corporations heading off over the hills.  While people may be jumping up and down there is no research or genuine evidence to suggest there would be a mass exodus of investment from Ireland if a 2.5% levy were applied for a number of years.  While we would still have a low corporation tax rate by international standards, Ireland provides other benefits that are very important for Americans or other transnationals coming here, who are using Ireland as a base for Europe and all sorts of other things.  We have a skilled labour force, a very positive approach to inward investment and so on.  We have many other things going for us as well as the tax regime.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	23	There was a suggestion to give vouchers to force people to spend child benefit on children.  It is very degrading especially for women to suggest they would neglect their children.  If there is neglect - criminal neglect - it should be dealt with in the proper way.  However, most parents would spend their last penny on their children before spending it on themselves.  It is degrading and discriminating.  Above all it is not practical.  For example, if a child wants to go on a school trip, would a parent bring the voucher into the school?  I believe some shops would refuse to take them.  It would be extra hassle for people who do not have private transport and cannot move to the place.  Would the Government designate certain shops or places where it can be spent?  As the administration of it would be very costly, it would not be in any way practical in addition to being very demeaning of people.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Social Justice Ireland agrees with what was said about small and medium-sized enterprises accessing funds.  We have proposed for some time that the Government should buy back the ICC Bank whose business specialised in giving credit to small and medium-sized enterprises.  The Department of Education and Skills has a policy document on student fees that outlines five different options for a student contribution income contingent loan in terms of the State providing the loan facility or a combination of State and bank.  It also provides costings for all these facilities.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I will elaborate on the ICC Bank proposal.  For three years we have been advocating having a strategic development bank, which is contained in the programme for Government.  We are somewhat concerned that it might not work as proposed.  We would have been more impressed if the Government simply bought back what the available part of ICC Bank.  That bank had worked for 50 years as an investment bank for small and medium-sized enterprises from the 1940s to the 1990s when we sold it because we thought we no longer needed it.  The main two pillar banks were never the funders for small and medium-sized enterprises - other banks did that.  Even with all other things being equal they do not have the experience and expertise required to provide the funding for small and medium-sized enterprises.  I believe we need a special investment vehicle in that context.  We have suggested buying back ICC Bank and capitalising it sufficiently so that it can leverage that to substantially higher levels and take if from there.  Obviously the student loans would not necessarily be tied to the two pillar banks, which have an "interesting" approach to investment at the moment.

The proposal would cost €140 million and would raise many families out of poverty.  We throw around millions of euro much more easily than we did a few years ago - it is now billions of euro that scare us.We already discussed the part-time job proposal.  In October I asked the Minister the question and found her response dismissive.  In the present crisis any proposal should be considered in a practical manner.  I want to tease it out with the witnesses further.  I was involved in a number of CE schemes that had that type of work and had intended moving on to the social economy when that existed or a co-operative.  It did not happen because of the sponsors of the scheme at the time.  For instance they worked with Waterways Ireland here in Dublin.  Plenty of work could be done to prepare Ireland for an increase in tourism in the future.  The Government has stated that there will be further jobs in that sector in the future.  We need to invest and this would be a quick way.  The fear I have, perhaps the witnesses will be able to allay those fears, is that some of these jobs will become yellow-pack part-time jobs.  While if a person can get another part-time job, it makes it beneficial, it also creates a poverty trap.  Was part of the proposal to have retraining and upskilling available as was one of the benefits of CE?  That means that as well as the work experience benefiting the community and the economy, the person can also retrain.The other issue is the displacement of jobs previously done by full-time workers.  For instance Dublin City Council has a maintenance department which has been run into the ground over the years so that it can no longer carry out the maintenance needed.  If it availed of this kind of work, there are many skilled people, especially former construction workers, who could help Dublin City Council or any local authority return the housing stock to social housing very quickly.  While that might not displace an existing job, it is displacing a job that previously existed and is not likely to come back.Various figures on emigration are in circulation ranging from 40,000 to 70,000.  What is the witnesses' information in this regard?  What is its effect on the economy given that many of the people now emigrating are skilled workers?  In previous generations unskilled workers were welcomed to their host countries.  However, most of the countries now taking Irish people are restricting entry to the highly skilled.  What will be the effect on the economy in five or ten years when, hopefully, we start growing again but will not have those skilled workers?
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I thank Dr. Healy and his team for their presentation.  We have discussed these issues previously.  We do not live in a high tax country, which is the message that must go out.  Page 3 of the presentation shows a table of the effect of taxation rates in Ireland.  I am not necessarily advocating that in current circumstances there should be a huge hike in tax rates but the value judgment of society during the past 14 years has been that with money in one's pocket one could pay for private education and grinds for one's children, purchase a car rather than take public transport and rather than depend on the public health care system could sign up to a private health care plan.  I am an advocate of a more fair, equitable and progressive system which would allow for all those things to be free.  As a society we need to discuss this issue.  I was interested to hear Dr. Healy's remarks in regard to a ten year discussion about Irish society.  The best we can come up with now, in terms of ambition for Ireland, is a return to the bond markets.  That is what all this pain is for, which is a pretty raw and uninspiring ambition for families experiencing tough times.Dr. Healy mentioned the six ways the previous budget hit the poor particularly badly, one of which is no longer in existence.  Which was the most difficult?  I assume it was the universal social charge.  Many kites have been flown in the past few weeks - playing with people's emotions - to the effect that the universal social charge will be tweaked or changed to take the pressure off the lower paid.  Perhaps Dr. Healy will give us his views on that.My final question is in many ways cruel and unfair in that it asks the delegates to differentiate between those on social welfare and the working poor, which differentiation should not be made.  Are the people most at risk of poverty those on social welfare who have a level of protection in terms of medical cards and so on or those who find themselves in the bracket of the working poor where the level of debt is unsustainable?  The latter may perhaps be people who purchased their council houses in recent years and whose incomes have dropped significantly since then.  I am interested in hearing the delegates views on that issue.On vouchers, I have a problem with the type of narrative which comes from the point of view of benefiting the child.  So many families are struggling and should not be tarred with the same brush as the small minority who cannot cope for various reasons and dysfunction in their homes.  To offer a family doing its best for its children a new voucher system would be the final insult.  I would welcome the delegates' comments on those issues.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I thank Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Ó Ríordáin for their contributions.  On Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point on refundable tax credits, we believe that the two main tax credits should be refundable.  We have shown how this could be funded.  The amount involved is relatively small and would have a huge impact on more than 100,000 employees.  With one stroke their income could be increased.  This would impact on households and approximately 240,000 people, which is incredible capacity.  It would also go some way towards tackling the working poor issue.  That proposal has much going for it.  The tragedy is that the cost of doing this was over-estimated by the Department of Finance, by a factor of 21, from 2001 through 2010 when it estimated the cost to be approximately €2 billion and €3 billion.  This issue was discussed at a previous meeting we had with the joint committee prior to the general election.  Some members present today attended that meeting as part of the previous Government.  The tragedy is that this could have been done at that time when the real cost was less than 5% of the estimated cost, which was unfortunate.  That is not the only time these types of mistakes were made by the same source.  We must be careful about what numbers are given in response to questions.On the part time jobs opportunities programme, we must ensure part time jobs are protected and do not become yellow pack jobs.  Part-time jobs melt away when an economy picks up.  It is in the interests of the organisations involved be they local authorities, community and voluntary organisations, local libraries who want to get maximum capacity from people to ensure this does not happen.  If people think they are working yellow pack jobs they will not be too positive about them.  Paying the going rate makes a difference.  Yellow pack jobs often require people to work 19.5 hours regardless of income.  When the going rate for a job, as accepted by unions and employers, is respected within the process it has a huge impact on people.  The participants to whom we spoke believed they had real jobs and were making serious contributions.As regards whether this creates poverty traps, the answer is "No" because there is no loss of welfare benefits and so on.  If a full time job becomes available a person can take it and is not tied to the part time job.  More than half the people involved during the three years in the mid-1990s when we piloted the scheme left to take up a job.  We created 1,000 jobs in different areas, including off the west coast where we created more jobs than Údarás, which we were very proud of.  However, that is another story.  The reality is that we created 1,000 jobs within 162 organisations, with more than 500 of the people involved moving on to full time jobs or training of other types.Training is not built into the programme.  Government is already providing a substantial amount of training in a variety of ways and is committed to further development in this area.  Also, it is targeting those developments at the people who need upskilling in a variety of different ways, including some of the categories mentioned today plus others.  However, many unemployed people already have skills.  These are people who worked for 20 years or more and are not all construction workers.  They have good skills which will be needed in ten or 15 years time.  We could create jobs that utilise these skills.  People who need further training should enter the training process but we should not confuse the two.  There are different programmes to assist people who need improvement.  We must keep things simple.  It seems to us to work better that way.I do not see any danger of displacement.  The reality is - taking the example of Dublin City Council given by the Deputy - that the council has allowed its maintenance and refurbishment section to wither on the vine.  It has lost most of its capacity and does not have people to do this work.  This did not just happen during the past few years.  People with real skills in the construction area could be taken up by the councils.  Maintenance and refurbishment saves money for councils in the long term.  These ideas need to be examined and piloted.  If there is no long term gain, so be it.Serious questions on emigration are not being answered.  The numbers in this regard are tricky owing to the fact that people who were migrants into Ireland in the first instance are returning home.  What bothers me most is that the Government's medium term fiscal strategy document published only a few weeks ago predicts a fall in unemployment levels during the next few years.  However, it is almost completely accounted for by people either leaving the labour force or emigrating, not by an increased number of jobs.  This worries me enormously because it appears as though a policy option is being taken to the effect that emigration is a route.  My colleagues and I were talking about this while waiting outside the room and we seriously question whether that route will be open.  Britain could well be heading into a recession as it is in a dodgy position.  Europe - the eurozone, in particular - obviously is in trouble.  However, it is not just the eurozone, as very slow growth is forecast for the entire European Union.  The United States is Ireland's third major place of export - of people as well as products - and it will not be possible to get in there to a great extent, as the position on green cards still prevails.  As for Australia, much tighter controls operate there.  Consequently, where are people going to emigrate to?  While it is true that skilled workers are leaving, they are struggling a lot in the places to which they are moving and I do not discern great space for large numbers to emigrate.This leads us back to stating we must deal with our own issues here, which is what we should be doing.  Perhaps we should return to the idea of having a ten year strategy, in which we consider where we want Ireland to be ten years from now.  Consideration should be given to what kind of society it will be, what services and what level of employment it will have.  We should examine how services will be provided and in what combinations, how they will be paid for, what the tax level will be, how much people will be obliged to pay and what the contribution will be.  These questions should be addressed in order that people will have a clear picture.I emphasised that Ireland is a low tax country, a point Deputy Ó Ríordáin also highlighted.  Chart 2 on page 3 of our submission is one of the most powerful visuals one could use to show that our effective tax rates are low by any standards.  I make the point to all members present, be they Government or Opposition or from the Dáil or the Seanad, that it would be much more sensible to look at effective tax rates, that is, the total amount one pays in tax as a percentage of one's total income.  I refer to both tax and social insurance in this regard.  It all goes together and includes the levies and everything else.  The chart shows what the effective rates look like.  In our discussions in Ireland we have a fixation with marginal rates, but if one considers effective rates, one gets a much better picture.We consider the universal social charge to be a move in the wrong direction.  It was based on a false premise that people should be making a contribution - as if they were not.  Before the introduction of the charge and the tax was applied to people much further down the income chain, it was argued that such persons were making no contribution to the State's coffers.  This completely ignored the level, for example, of income from low income households being paid in VAT.  When one examines the distribution of VAT payments across society and breaks them down into 10% deciles, one gets a simple chart on which one can see that a very low proportion of income from the top decile goes on VAT.  However, as one moves down the income chain, the percentage rises and the proportion becomes dramatic.  Our point is that there must be recognition that VAT is a tax people pay.  Moreover, it is a tax that everyone, even the poorest person, pays.  They do so because they cannot survive otherwise.  They pay VAT on most items they buy, albeit not on food.  Consequently, such persons pay a lot of their income in VAT and are already making a tax contribution.  The universal social charge went in the wrong direction and should not have been put in place.  There certainly should be some alleviation in that context.I will refer to two other issues, one of which is in this context.  Members will not be surprised that I will not differentiate between the working poor and people in receipt of welfare benefits.  We need a situation where every man, woman and child in Ireland has the resources required to live life with dignity.  That trips off the tongue, but at another level, it is absolutely doable, even though we are in a difficult position.  However, Ireland is not a poor country.  Despite everything that has happened to us in the last four years and more, this is not a poor country.  We must make choices, but such choices should not be between the deserving and the non-deserving poor, which is an awful distinction of which I have been hearing more recently, or between the working and the non-working poor, which I personally consider to be nonsense.  I acknowledge they are different groups, but both are living without sufficient income to live life with dignity.  They are making choices between having money for food or fuel.  This is not a choice people should be obliged to make in Ireland in the 21st century, as we have the resources.I will make one final point because I did not answer Deputy Halligan's question earlier.  He asked me what were the responses of Ministers to the proposal regarding part-time jobs.  Perhaps I might use the word "enigmatic," but that might be glorifying it.  Please allow me to go through the Ministers with whom we have discussed the proposal.  We have discussed it with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, neither of whom made any comment or gave any reaction, response or observation.  Members know them better than do I and can make their own interpretation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	31	We also presented it to other Ministers, many officials and advisers to various Ministers, including advisers to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  Advisers tend to be people who are interested in how proposals would work and so on and consequently were probing it.  It appeared to us that early on Ministers in both parties perhaps did not get it.  We were proposing measures such as this last April and May and perhaps people were just newly in office and hundreds of things they had not been dealing with previously were coming at them every day.  Perhaps it was simply a question of it being early days.  More recently, we have had engagement and some traction with it in discussions with Ministers such as the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and others, but I still have serious doubts as to whether the proposal is being taken seriously.  I still have serious doubts as to whether it will be picked up and implemented.  I would consider a failure to do so to be almost incredible because there are very few options or proposals that would provide one with the kind of bang for one's buck one could get with this proposal.  In addition, there are very few proposals that would have such an impact in reducing long-term unemployment.

It is clear that all members agree with the proposal and, as a committee, they might be able to do something to push it forward, even within the time constraints.  Other recommendations can be considered.  As a vote has been called in the Dáil, I will take the remaining questions in case Deputies are unable to return, as the committee must vacate the room by 11.30 a.m.  There is time to take the questions and we can either return for the answers or, if necessary, receive get them in writing.  Questions from two Deputies are outstanding, namely, Deputies Ryan and Conaghan.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I wish to make a brief observation on child benefit.  As everyone is aware, child benefit is not an automatic payment.  In order to receive it, one must apply for it.  This is in reference to the position of Mr. Michael O'Leary in this regard.  Certainly, if child benefit is going into that household, it is because someone there has applied for it and if he is not interested in it, perhaps it is Mrs. O'Leary.I compliment Social Justice Ireland on its fantastic submission.  The underpinning analysis of the mix between tax and cuts is one I personally support.  However, the reality of the next budget is we will not have that mix.  There will be a ratio of cuts to taxation increases of approximately 60:40.  At the last election, the Labour Party advocated a 48% tax on higher incomes.  It was slated for this and attacked by other parties for being the party of tax and spend.  How does Dr. Healy think one might overcome this?  How does he think a point can be reached at which some political consensus can be arrived at or a sense developed as a country that this mindset ought to be changed in terms of what we might do?I refer to the 60:40 mix with which we actually will be faced.  Are there any priorities in the organisation's document Dr. Healy would advocate achieving within the 60:40 mix with which we will be faced?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	34	One would be to overcome the public resistance to this and to ensure the public understand it.  A simple thing that should be done, which we have advocated to every Government since early 1990s, is that the discussion at budget time and subsequently in the Dáil, Seanad and public arena should focus principally on the effective tax rate.  The key issue is the amount of the total income earned that a household has and the amount of that income that is collected in tax?  When taxes are changed a person will measure not the rates or whatever that have been played around with but the impact of the changes in tax in terms of the money in his or her pocket as to whether he or she lost or gained another euro.  That is the bottom line.  That is the effective tax rate.  As a contribution towards the debate on this issue, we would say to the two Ministers with responsibility for finance, other Ministers, Deputies and Senators that in everything they do they should always focus primarily on the effective tax rate and put the issue into the public domain in order that people begin to realise that when they talk about the amount of money they will keep in their pockets or the amount that has been taken from them, they are talking about the effective tax rate.  That is what impacts on them and they need to make that connection.  That is the first issue.The second issue is that we need to put this issue into the broader European context.  We need to have this discussion.  We have had garbled versions of it with references to Boston versus Berlin but that is an extraordinary garbled version of what we are talking about.  It is much more nuanced than that.In our welfare state and other European countries there are different options taken by countries on what to provide and what people have to pay for.  If the provision is small, the tax is small but the provision then has to be made up from private money.  As a member said, that means that public transport is not available in many areas and one has to drive a car, or a school may not be built when one wants it to be in place because it comes down to public provision and the money is not available to build it, or a health care facility is not available in one's area and one has to drive a long distance to access such a facility.  There are serious issues involved and that is the reason we need a much longer-term debate and engagement on where Ireland wants to be in the next ten years.In terms of what to choose, we would choose the kinds of measures we suggested within the 60:40 mix rather than the 2:1 mix.  We would choose the kinds of measures that would not impact on households.  I would put in anti-bad nutrition tax, text tax and gambling tax.  My view is that a corporate levy is a flyer if people were to take it up.  I would be careful about taxes that impact on households.  There is the likelihood that there will be a carbon tax, a household tax and a variety of other measures that will hit households as well as cuts in child benefit.

Some of what has been proposed will focus our minds for next week and some of it is for the long term, so we might be able to engage with the witnesses again next year.  I thank them for attending.
