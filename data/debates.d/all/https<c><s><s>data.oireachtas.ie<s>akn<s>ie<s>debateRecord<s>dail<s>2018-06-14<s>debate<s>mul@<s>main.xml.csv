#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	Before we go into the questions, I point out that six and a half minutes are allocated to each question, with 30 seconds to put the question, two minutes for the Minister's reply, a minute for the Deputy to put a supplementary, a minute for the Minister to reply, a final response from the Deputy, and a final response from the Minister. I am sticking to this rigidly, because, day after day, we find that four, five or six people sit here waiting for their questions to be answered and, because we break the time regulations, they lose out and that is not fair. When the Minister's two minutes are done, I will say that it is on the record. It is the same for the Deputy when the minute is up. I will say that we have to move on.

I have a quick question. The Minister knows that the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has been announced and that Pillar 2, from which the money for rural development outside the farm gate comes from, is proposed to be cut radically. Has the Minister started early negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that this does not have a huge knock-on impact on the Leader programme? It is well down already-----
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Deputy.

#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	We are ten seconds over already. The Minister has two minutes.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	The European Commission has proposed, as part of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for 2021 to 2027, that approximately €78.8 billion would be allocated for rural development funding over the next seven-year period. I understand that this equates to approximately €1.85 billion for Ireland and represents a reduction in the region of 15% on the current funding period. It should be noted that the proposal published by the European Commission is the initial MFF proposal. The final outcome will be determined by negotiations at EU level over the coming year. Achieving Ireland's priorities in these negotiations will be a key issue for the Government. The matter has been discussed by the Government and work is well under way to achieve a satisfactory outcome from negotiations. I, together with my Government colleagues, will carefully monitor progress in these negotiations at EU level over the coming months. A decision regarding the level of funding required for the various elements of Ireland's rural development programme, including Leader, can only be made following the conclusion of the overall MFF negotiations. I assure the Deputy that I will continue to strongly defend the Leader budget as the MFF negotiation progresses.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	I thank the Minister for his co-operation.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	I thank the Minister for his reply but the situation is simpler than he has outlined. While obviously the Government will try to get as much money as it can from Brussels, if it decreases, the Minister can increase the national contribution. He could say today, if he had the assurances of his two ministerial colleagues, that no matter what happens, we will revert to the €400 million that was in the Leader programme and that we will make up whatever shortfall from Brussels that arises. I hoped to hear today that no matter what happens in Brussels, the Government is committed to a hugely increased Leader programme the next time. The Minister might clarify whether he has had those discussions and let the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform deal with how much of a rebate he gets from Brussels but have the Government commitment to go back to the €400 million minimum for Leader.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	We have had negotiations at Cabinet about the CAP. The Deputy knows that is important, particularly for rural people, rural life, farmers and agriculture. On the Leader aspect, the negotiations are ongoing. We cannot show our hand yet. We have to wait and see what the negotiations will finalise. As the Deputy knows, Commissioner Hogan indicated that if the rest of the European Union increased its contribution by 10%, we would be able to increase Leader funding.As such, we have to wait and see what the final negotiations are. At Cabinet level, I will ensure we maintain the funding for Leader, but we have to wait and see what happens. This must also go to the European Parliament where our MEPs will have a contribution to make. This has a long way to go yet.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	I cannot understand the mentality of putting extra money into Brussels to get a percentage of it back when it would be much simpler for the Government to put it straight into the Leader programme and not lose a lot of money in transmission while having a whole lot of rules added to it in its transmission back here. I seek a commitment that Leader will revert to the €400 million plus level between 2007 and 2013. The current Leader programme is significantly underfunded, not because of the European cut, albeit there was one, but because of the cut in the Exchequer contribution. Every year, inflation eats into this. Over a 21-year period from 2007, there will be a 40% decrease in the value of money at 2% per annum.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The Deputy is correct in that we want Leader funding and I want to see it maintained. He knows, however, having been around a long time himself, that if one goes to a fair, one does not put one's best bid forward first. The Government, in particular the Taoiseach, will negotiate on CAP. They will be long negotiations and we cannot show our hand until we see what the proposals are. There is a proposal on the table, but it is only that and there is a long way to go. The proposal will have to go to the Government and the European Parliament and a lot of discussion on it will take place in the next number of months. This has to be finalised by May 2019 and we will not put our hand up and say what we are going to do at national level. We have to wait and see what is agreed on the proposal put forward by Commissioner Hogan. There is a great deal of negotiating to be done between now and then and I will monitor it. I will be watching this in relation to the Leader programme and working with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, who will be fighting to ensure that CAP funding is maintained for Ireland given the serious potential effects for farmers in rural Ireland.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	Many parts of rural and regional Ireland are crying out for a public banking service. It is a model we are seeking to have rolled out as quickly as possible. Has the Minister received the report on this from the Department of Finance and when will it be made public? For almost six months, we have been told it will be published within a couple of weeks. We need to get it done quickly and we need to put plans in place to move this forward. We are always told that a problem with the banking sector is the lack of competition. Here we have a bank that wants to enter the field and we should do everything possible to encourage that and bring it forward.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	I thank the Deputy for the question. Officials from my Department and the Department of Finance have been working closely together since last year to investigate the feasibility of a new model of community banking for Ireland, including through the German Sparkasse model for the development of local public banks. The project team carried out detailed research into the concept with a particular focus on the Sparkasse model. As part of its investigation, the project team also met with a number of stakeholders, including the organisation referred to by the Deputy. The organisation in question submitted a proposal to officials of both Departments for a possible model of local public banking in Ireland and this proposal has been analysed in detail. My Department has also conducted a wider public consultation to seek views on the concept of a community banking model. The invitation to submit responses was open to all and was extended in particular to main stakeholders and Members of the Oireachtas. The consultation ran for four weeks and 16 submissions were received. The submissions have been assessed, and the views of the respondents have been taken into consideration and will be reflected in the forthcoming report. The report has now been completed and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I submitted it to Government for consideration in recent weeks. I anticipate that the report will be published shortly.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	While that is welcome news, we have been hearing for a long time about imminent publication. As such, the Minister will understand the frustration that is out there. A large section of the public, in particular in rural Ireland, has seen bank services withdrawn. I have spoken to the Minister about this on numerous occasions as high street banks have closed down all over the country. Not only are banks closing down, small businesses and farmers are finding it more difficult to access loans at appropriate rates. That is the reality for many people, in particular in rural areas. The public banking model is about regionalised banks which focus on the region in which they are situated to provide keen interest rates and look after the people. It is not driven by profit and making maximum profits for shareholders. It is a model which resonates strongly with the public due to the negative experience they have had with the financial sector in Ireland. I appeal to the Minister to get the report published. We have heard for some time the phrase "in a few weeks". Reading through newspaper articles, I see we have been told the report would be published within a number of weeks on several occasions, including last January, last April and, again, today. We need to get this report published as quickly as possible.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	The Minister for Finance and I have agreed the report and we want to get it published as quickly as possible. The Deputy is correct about the financial sector. I am not afraid to say it and have done so on many occasions in the House. We do not have functioning banks for small businesses. We have banks but they are not functioning. As a sitting Deputy, my constituents are coming to me and pointing out that, notwithstanding the fact that they have good collateral, they cannot get loans from banks. That is the experience with the two major banks. I would like competition in the market. We will get the report published as quickly as possible. We are engaged in consultations with other stakeholders and agencies at the moment. We want to publish the report and I guarantee that it will be published shortly.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	The fear people have is that the other stakeholders are, in the main, the big banks. One of the problems we have in this country is the influence of the main financial services providers. They are a major influence in stopping anybody else from coming into the market. People are fearful that the Department of Finance is somehow or other being influenced by those who are on the field and who want to ensure that no one else gets onto it. I trust that the Minister is doing the right thing and I hope we will see a result soon. I hope that not only will the report published but that a pilot using this model will be rolled out, first of all in the midlands before being extended to eight regions around the country. That has to happen before the end of the year. That is how urgent this is. In particular with Brexit coming at them, businesses cannot continue to survive if they are dependent on the mainstream banks which are not functioning for them, as the Minister has acknowledged. Let us put this in place. Let us give a commitment that the Government will ensure that this model is in place before the end of 2018.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	The report will be published and Members can discuss it when that happens. People in this country have suffered because of the behaviour of the banks and we must be careful about what banking institutions we put in now. People talk about the banks every day here. I read only last week in the newspapers about difficulties in some of the financial institutions. The taxpayers of this country have suffered enough. The ordinary citizens have suffered because of the main banks and what they did to the country and its economy. When the report is published, we can discuss it further.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	The community services programme is important. The way it always worked was that the minimum wage was paid to each company, along with the employers' PRSI, for all participants, plus a grant for the manager. In certain cases, there was supplementary funding. That continued to be the way until 2014. Since then, however, the system has changed and companies must now come up with funding themselves to supplement the grant provided to pay the minimum wage. Will this continue?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	The community services programme, CSP, supports 400 community organisations to provide local services through a social enterprise model. Funding is provided as a contribution to the cost of a manager and an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions. More than €46 million is available to support community organisations under the programme for 2018. The CSP contribution is not aligned to the national minimum wage. It is a fixed annual contribution that is required to be co-funded by the organisations concerned from other sources, for example, from income received from the public use of their facilities and services. Having said that, a CSP support fund was established in 2016 to help organisations to secure their sustainability and assist them in meeting their obligations regarding wages. The fund provided additional funding to select organisations on a reducing scale over the three-year period from 2016 to 2018. My Department will commence a review of the CSP later in the year. The review will consider, among other things, how the programme fits with overall Government priorities as well as my Department's other community programmes and policy objectives. Decisions on the structure of funding supports for CSP-funded organisations will be taken upon completion of the review.

A company with five full-time equivalent staff now has to find €10,000 simply to pay wages, not to mention meeting all the other overhead costs faced. As the Minister is aware, some of these companies provide meals-on-wheels services or run community centres where there is no major revenue stream. Yet, they keep these places open all day or provide fundamental community services where there are limited income sources. Is it the Minister's intention to return to the situation that obtained up to 2015, when the full wage was covered for the full-time equivalent staff who were approved under the community services grant?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	This is an important programme. I like this programme and it is working well. Deputy Ó Cuív knows that what we give is a grant. We are not the employers. For me or the Department to commit to what Deputy Ó Cuív is asking for would cost €3 million. We are supporting 1,670 full-time jobs and we have 300 managers. That amounts to almost 2,000 people. A sum of €3 million is a great deal of money. At present, we have new organisations that want to come in on the programme. Some of the older organisations are being reviewed. I would have to find €3 million. I will give one commitment to Deputy Ó Cuív. We are undertaking a review of the programme. No review of the programme has been done for a long time. However, I will have to find extra money if I am to meet and support his request. We provided €600,000 to support groups that were finding it difficult to meet their costs, especially with regard to the minimum wage. Over 150 applications were received. We provided grant aid to and supported more than 100 of these. We are aware of the problem and we are providing support. However, to cover the cost of the minimum wage would cost me and the Department €3 million. If I were to provide €3 million, I would have to start looking at the 1,670 people on the scheme and the 300 managers. I would have to find that money some way. The only way I can find it is either by getting extra funding or reducing some of the schemes in place.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	Funnily enough, even during the downturn every Minister responsible could find the money. We paid more than the minimum wage because we retained the wages of the people employed under the programme at the level they had been. That was fine until the current Taoiseach became Minister for Social Protection. Then, hey presto, in 2015 - suddenly and for the first time since the scheme started - the grant did not cover the minimum wage. The Minister says €3 million is a great deal of money. It is a great deal of money to the Department.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	Yes.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	However, it was a mean cut in the Department of Social Protection. The then Minister cut €3 million from the programme out of €20 billion. In fact, when he cut it initially, it was €1.5 million. Will the Minister go back to the Taoiseach, ask for his money back and undo the mean cut that the Taoiseach introduced in 2015?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	Deputy Ó Cuív knows that I inherited this scheme on 1 January. A total of €46.2 million came with the scheme. I increased the allocation by €850,000 to bring in 12 new organisations. It was the first call since 2008. There had been no call for new schemes since 2008. Deputy Ó Cuív knows that the period between 2013 and 2015 was difficult for both the economy and the country in general. I inherited this scheme and I have increased the funding for it this year. I will go back to Government and seek further funding. I am going to have this scheme reviewed. I am going to see what I can do in respect of the minimum wage. However, I am keen to make clear and to put on the record of the Dáil that we are not the employers. We support the schemes. Deputy Ó Cuív is correct. These schemes cover a social aspect that neither Government nor State agencies cover. Without these schemes, we would have a major difficulty so I want to support them. When the review takes place, that is one of the things I will be examining.
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	During the past 12 months or more the Minister has allocated funding for the local improvement scheme. I commend him greatly on that because the scheme had been stalled for several years, much to the detriment of rural communities. It is back now and it is really popular. Most local authorities will say that the funding given by the Minister is great but that they want triple or quadruple what they are getting. Does the Minister have extra funds for the scheme this year?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I understand the Deputy is referring to plans to allocate extra funding to the local improvement scheme, LIS, in 2018. The LIS is a scheme for carrying out improvement works on private and non-public roads. The type of roads covered under the scheme are not under the normal maintenance of the county councils. However, they provide vital links for people living in rural areas and need to be maintained to enable people living in rural Ireland to access their homes, farm land or amenities. For many years, there was no dedicated funding for the LIS due to the constraints on the public finances. However, I allocated €10 million in funding for the LIS in September 2017. The scheme is administered by the county councils. The councils prioritise the roads to be repaired and carry out the works. Based on demand for the scheme and the capacity of local authorities to complete further works before the end of last year, I allocated an additional €7.4 million for LIS roads in November 2017. Building on the success of last year's scheme, I approved €10.8 million to county councils for LIS roads in February of this year. In total, over 1,100 LIS roads will have benefited from the investment of €28 million made by my Department since last September. As part of the 2018 LIS scheme, I requested each county council to compile a secondary list of suitable LIS road projects which they could complete if additional funding becomes available for the scheme later this year. I will be monitoring the situation in the context of my Department's overall expenditure performance over the coming months.
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	I thank the Minister. I am in not here to criticise him in any way for what he is doing because he could do no better than he has done to date. It is simply a matter of encouraging a deeper look to determine whether there could be an extra allocation of funding at the end of this year. In south west Cork I know of €2 million or €3 million worth of projects seeking funding. Those involved cannot get it because they have an allocation and they are trying to work through that allocation. That allocation was not in place two or three years ago although it was desperately needed at the time. Yet, it is in place now. The money is welcome but I appeal to the Minister to concentrate and take a closer look. It could help areas like Castletownbere, the road out to Mizen Head and back into Skibbereen, as well as Bantry and such places. Projects in these areas are seeking funding allocations.I would appreciate if the Minister would consider giving extra investment for it this year.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	To be fair to Deputy Michael Collins, he did acknowledge that there was no scheme for many years and that it is up and running now. A total of €17.5 million was spent on the scheme last year. There was no dedicated LIS scheme in recent years. Councils receive money from rates and other contributions. I agree with Deputy Michael Collins that there are many roads in rural areas that we need to address. I would like to see local authorities and perhaps the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport putting funding into the scheme. There are many roads with problems because we did not have a scheme for many years and if everybody put a bit into the pot we would get more roads done. A total of 1,100 roads have been completed in 12 months and if we could get a bit of extra funding from the local authorities and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport perhaps we could get more roads done. Perhaps elected representatives could speak to county councillors to suggest that councils should put some money out of their own resources into the LIS. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, is a rural Deputy himself and he is aware that people make a contribution to the scheme in addition to paying their taxes and water charges. The State also makes a contribution. I would like to see local authorities making a contribution but instead some local authorities charge us for the work and we could get more roads done if they did not charge us for their staff time.
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	I will definitely take that on board. I will speak to my brother, Councillor Danny Collins, to see if he could push Cork County Council to come on board and co-fund these projects going forward. Between the LIS and the community services scheme it is a fabulous opportunity for communities to make progress. I accept that, unfortunately, they will have to contribute a little but that is fine given the long-term benefit. I plead with the Minister to consider allocating more funds to the scheme going forward as we are only barely reaching what needs to be done. I commend the Minister on dealing with 1,100 roads to date but thousands of roads have not been addressed. I look forward to the Minister having a chance to announce further funding for the scheme before the year is out.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	The Minister will hardly announce the new funding today.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	I am looking at my Department's finances at the moment. I like the scheme, I want to support it and there is a need for it. A very serious problem has arisen in recent years given that no scheme was in place. There is a big build-up of roads that need to be addressed. We will continue with the current funding allocation and if I can find further funding between now and the end of the year I will make it available. I have asked the local authorities to get a LIS project ready if we have funding. I also asked them to prioritise the funding they have been allocated. Some of them did very well with the funding they were allocated but others did not do so well. The weather has been fairly good in recent months and local authorities are carrying out work on the roads. I would like to see them deal with LIS roads. I put on record that I will put in a condition that any local authority that does not spend its allocation by the deadline will not get additional funding if it becomes available in September. We set a deadline of July and the local authorities asked if it could be extended until August, which we allowed. Deputy Michael Collins might come back to criticise me on the basis that Cork got no money.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	That is quite clear from the Minister.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	As the Minister is aware, the north fringe is a vast new urban district which was started nearly 20 years ago but was stopped for nearly ten years. Up to 20,000 people live there in areas such as Clongriffin, Belmayne, the coast and Burnell, yet we do not have many of the key services one would expect in such a big district such as education, health, sport and recreation. People believe it would be beneficial to have a multifunctional community centre in the heart of the area, namely, in Clongriffin. My question is whether the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, could be used. The Minister could become one of the stakeholders in such a project.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 45 together. My Department supports the local community development committees which are responsible for overseeing local and community development funding and identifying local needs through the local economic and community plan, LECP, process. Dublin City Council's LECP includes as a strategic goal the provision of a range of public, safe and affordable amenities, activities and facilities that are accessible to people of all ages and abilities. In line with this strategic goal, a community centre was recently established in Clongriffin, on the north side of Dublin city. The centre is leased by Dublin City Council and the amenity has been available to local community groups since its official launch on 14 May last. My Department provides a range of supports to communities and community centres nationwide, in both urban and rural areas, by helping citizens to participate in the development of their communities and by providing funding to improve facilities. The public participation networks enable citizens to have a greater say in local government decisions which affect their own communities. These networks are represented on the local community development committees. In addition, the community enhancement programme which I launched last month can contribute towards the renovation of community centres. My Department also provides funding under the Leader programme, which can support the development of community centres outside of the five main cities. Separately, once a community centre is in place, the community services programme supports community businesses to provide local services and create employment opportunities for disadvantaged people. Under the programme, my Department can provide a contribution to the cost of a manager and an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	The Minister mentioned Leader and the other programmes. It seems that this significant new urban district is falling between the cracks. We had the opening of a new hub, which essentially is a small space. We have a very vibrant community in Clongriffin and the adjoining districts. Besides the local "Dubs" and people from all over Ireland, including the Minister's county, we also have up to 40 different nationalities. People have seen what is done in other areas. Unfortunately, we are not a strategic development zone but we have seen a major new multifunctional community centre placed beside the secondary school in Phibblestown in the Taoiseach's constituency and in a number of other areas, thereby creating a centre for the area. We have also seen developments in many comparator cities, for example Stockholm, which also has a major new urban district on the north of the city but where key services were put in at the start, whereas Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and main developers such as Gannon and Kearns have been incredibly slow to put in the key services that are required. We campaigned for ten years for a railway station. I welcome what the Minister outlined and I urge him to consider becoming a stakeholder in the area. I know the energy the Minister has put into looking after the urban spaces in Westport, Ballina and Castlebar in his constituency.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	I agree with Deputy Broughan's sentiments. I have visited some of the communities in Limerick and Dublin and in some rural areas. We have the community enhancement programme, the RAPID programme and the community facility programme. I joined two of the schemes together because the grant aid provided was small. Local community development committees, LCDCs, community groups, elected representatives and chambers of commerce can identify the areas most in need of grant aid. I accept that the amount of grant aid available is not significant. The inner city is not Deputy Broughan's area of Dublin but we provided €3.5 million for it given the level of need and demand. Cherry Orchard received funding last year because of the problems associated with the area. The community had raised its own funds. It has a large hinterland and it had no centre. I agree with what Deputy Broughan has said. I want to see communities such as the one he has spoken about supported. Now that the economy is beginning to lift I want to see places like that getting the same opportunity. A total of €190 million is available under the SICAP programme over five years. I want to target disadvantage in communities on an individual basis and help the citizens who might not have got a chance in recent years. Many people have been targeted through the SICAP programme in particular in recent years and they have set up their own businesses. Some of them have accessed further education. We are now creating jobs for them. We must give them the opportunity and the supports.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	There is a tremendous community spirit among the residents and many local community activities but people feel the need of a multifunctional community centre. The area was developed on the basis that it would be the size of Waterford city which means up to 50,000 people. I accept that Waterford will expand in the future. It is a huge new urban district.People feel it is at a critical point in its development. If we do not come in with community facilities in the next year or two we could lose the area and would then be facing remedial measures, which we do not want. The indicative cost is about €6 million or €7 million. It would be important for the Department to be one of the stakeholders or pillars to allow this to be done. Part of the problem is that we have two county councils doing opposite things on the other side of the border, with smaller community spaces. We need to have everybody together in a multifaceted effort to create a community. In respect of pastoral centres founded by different religious organisations but belonging to the whole community, is the Minister in favour of supports for them as well?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	I would be supportive of anything that is good for community. It does not matter what religion, colour or creed - I want to support communities like that. There is a scheme I urge the Deputy to investigate himself and to talk to Dublin City Council about. It is a new €2 billion urban regeneration fund that will be opening some time in June. The Deputy might look at making an application with the city council under that fund. These are the kind of projects that should be supported. Maybe the county council and other State agencies would assist the Deputy and the community to make an application. Applications will be open in June, announcements will be made in November and there will be a second round next year. This and all the existing schemes are there to support communities. Deputy Ó Cuív had a question about the communities programme. We provide funding for staff and managers to support them. The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and all the other schemes are there. I urge the Deputy to look at that urban regeneration scheme. I want to see areas of disadvantage getting an opportunity to draw some funding out of this as well. It does not always have to be where we want to create jobs. We also have to create a society and give people an opportunity.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	Coming from a west of Ireland constituency that is doing well, no doubt thanks to his own role, I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is aware of the consequences for employment in rural Ireland of a hard Brexit. They have been well documented to date. There could be negative impacts and consequences for rural industries, especially agriculture, agrifood and processing, which constitute the backbone of employment provision for many thousands of our people in villages and towns across rural Ireland. What steps are being taken to ensure the Government is fully prepared to deal with such an eventuality?
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, has the primary responsibility for leading on Brexit negotiations on behalf of the Government. My Department has been making and will continue to make contributions to Brexit discussions, and is providing policy advice relevant to its remit as and when required. This Department was established to bring a greater level of co-ordination and cohesion to policies that impact rural Ireland and communities in order to ensure that economic recovery can be felt right across the country. Part of that involves ensuring the potential impacts of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union are mitigated in those communities most likely to be affected by Brexit. Regional and rural businesses face enormous potential challenges on this front, particularly in the Border region, and this is relevant across a number of policy areas of my Department. In this context, considerations around the impact of Brexit are shared across different policy areas, rather than being assigned to a single unit or to dedicated staff. In addition, my role in the Cabinet committee on the economy gives me a specific forum to raise issues for rural Ireland relating to the economy, jobs, the labour market, competitiveness, productivity, trade, the Action Plan on Rural Development, and the digital economy, including managing and mitigating the risks associated with Brexit.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	The Minister of State is aware, of course, that regional and rural businesses are extremely vulnerable and susceptible to the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, particularly given how the negotiations are drifting. In the Border region this is particularly pronounced but it is also apparent right across the country. It is extremely difficult to perceive any upside in respect of the current impasse in the negotiations. There is a clearly fractured British Government on one side, whose members are busy negotiating among themselves and cannot get agreement. How can Monsieur Barnier and his team at EU level try to achieve something in that context? It is all in a very precarious balance. A White Paper has not even been furnished by the British side to enable substantive, sustainable or significant negotiations to take place. There are critical issues that affect the whole of Ireland, such as how to achieve a frictionless and open Border and preserve and protect the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. I am concerned about how far advanced we are. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is leading matters but what input has the Department of Rural and Community Development? Does it have any staff specifically assigned to ensure there is input into all areas and the necessary strategies are formulated and put in place? This is of momentous importance to all our communities.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	We have tabled a similar question, No. 24. I support Deputy Penrose in that respect. My question was to ask the Minister if we have contact with the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland around this issue. Swanlinbar in County Cavan is part of my constituency. It is in the same parish as Kinawley across the Border. There is such a movement of people and business; everything that happens crosses the Border. It is just like two townlands beside each other in any part of rural Ireland. There needs to be an emphasis placed by those on both sides of the Border on working with the authorities on both sides to come up with solutions for the people who live in these areas because they are all our people.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	Clearly, Ireland wants the closest possible relationship with the UK post Brexit. Everything we are doing is to ensure that happens. We are still of the view that the optimum outcome for the UK is for it to remain part of the Single Market and the customs union. That is a matter for the United Kingdom and it is in the throes of debate on those very issues. There is detailed work going on across Government in respect of this area. The Deputies contributing now are from the midlands and Border areas. My colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has a particular affinity with ensuring that everything possible is done to mitigate the impacts of Brexit on the Border areas. There are ongoing negotiations across all of Government. The Taoiseach paid a very positive visit to Northern Ireland last week, to both sides and traditions, and was well received. There has been ongoing engagement. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, met recently with the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, MP, in respect of agriculture and food. There are a number of dedicated measures including the €300 million Brexit loan scheme for businesses which was launched in March and increased funding to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation as well as the €25 million Brexit response loan scheme for the agrifood sector and additional supports also for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia in terms of marketing and promotion.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	We need a very close working relationship. In the context of our exports and imports, there is great interdependence and has been for years. There are people travelling and the common travel area is obviously protected. The relationships are significant and, as Deputy Martin Kenny said, we are intertwined at all levels, even at micro level. I read an interesting article in The Sunday Business Post about Drum, a small area. Fields are straddling the Border. There is no thought given by those hard Brexiteers. One of them was mouthing last week, Boris Johnson. He did not even know and obviously has never visited the area and has no concept of the degree of interdependence. We have it in the agri industry, for example Lakeland and the dairying industry, as well as the pig and sheep industries. There is such a degree of interrelatedness and interoperability. There has to be free flow of goods. Apart altogether from the significance of the Good Friday Agreement and all it entails, mere common sense would dictate that this is critical. North, South, east and west, there has to be free flow. The Minister of State and the Government will have our full support in trying to achieve this.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	It is hugely important that everyone in this House is on the one side and, clearly, they are in terms of the necessity of getting the best deal possible in terms of Brexit.Obviously, it was a decision for the UK. We wished it did not happen but it is the reality that has resulted from the decision made by the UK. There is a team effort from every part of Government to ensure that the best possible deal will be achieved. It is very important that people at senior levels in the UK Government are acutely aware of and visit communities in Northern Ireland. It is certainly not too late. I know there have been some visits but we need to ensure they know about the cross-trade nature, the cross relationships between communities and matters relating to, as Deputy Martin Kenny said, parishes, the number of road crossings and the number of farmers with land on both sides of the Border. There are real issues that are either impacting or could impact on communities, particularly those along the Border, so it is hugely important that we continue the team effort within Government and within this House to ensure that the best possible deal is achieved regarding Brexit.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	The Minister recently announced funding for the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, which has been up and running for the past couple of years. Can he give an indication of the types of projects that have been funded to date and, specifically, in the context of the current scheme, as advertised? What will be the selection criteria for the projects that fit into that scheme?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	The outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure and for the maintenance, enhancement or promotion of existing outdoor recreational infrastructure. The scheme facilitates the development of numerous greenways, blueways, walks and other trails across the country. In 2016, 117 projects throughout Ireland were selected for funding of €7.4 million from a total of 221 expressions of interest received from local authorities, local development companies and State agencies during 2015. Under the 2017 scheme, 251 projects were approved for funding of €13.6 million from a total of 376 applications which were received by my Department from local authorities and State agencies. The applications under both the 2016 and 2017 schemes were assessed under the following general headings: the collaborative nature of the application; the element of match funding available; the provision of detailed costings of all elements of the project; and the amount of added recreational value that the project would bring to the community, the region or nationally. I launched the 2018 outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme on 1 June last, with an allocation of €12 million to continue to support important local, regional and national rural recreation projects this year and into 2019. Details of all projects funded under the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme in 2016 and 2017 and the scheme outline for 2018 can be found on the rural recreation pages of my Department's website.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	This is a very good scheme of which I am very supportive. I tabled this question because I had some slight concerns following the Minister's announcement. I am very conscious of the fact that he represents rural Ireland so well. When he launched this scheme, it was noticeable that he spoke about improving recreational facilities significantly to enhance the quality of life of people who live close to the projects and to support sustainable economic development in rural areas. He went on to say that increasing tourism is a key pillar of the action plan for rural redevelopment. My concern is to ensure that these projects would not all be rurally based. There is a very significant need for these projects in urban areas to enhance tourism but also for people's well-being in terms of healthy lifestyles. In respect of the Minister's emphasis on rural Ireland, which I understand because there is nobody better than the Minister when it comes to looking after rural Ireland, it should not be the case that people in Dublin and other urban areas do not have facilities such as the Great Western Greenway in the Minister's county. I want an assurance from the Minister that while he referred to rural Ireland in his press release, urban areas will be treated equally in the context of this grant.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	The outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme is the name of the scheme. It is an all-Ireland scheme. It is for everybody - town, village, rural area or city. On this occasion I am looking at allowing Leader companies come in with regard to the smaller schemes. I will leave the two bigger schemes to the local authorities. The Deputy is quite correct. These have been a tremendous success. They have added value, particularly to the tourism product throughout the country. I have visited towns and villages - cities not so much - in respect of the scheme but it does not matter whether an application worthy of support relates to Dublin, Mayo, Cork or Kerry. I know we gave major funding. I will ask the Department to let the Deputy know whether we have funded anything in the Dublin area. I cannot remember off the top of my head but I know we made a major investment of €1 million into walks in and around Cork city.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I have to bring the Minister to some of the urban areas. Last year, South Dublin County Council ran what one might describe as a participatory budget competition whereby the local communities were able to promote ideas and vote on them. One of the issues they voted on and where they recommended that money be spent involved the restoration of what is called the Silver Bridge. It is also known as Guinness Bridge or Farmleigh Bridge. It crosses the Liffey from Waterstown Park in Palmerstown to Farmleigh. It joins the two parks - Phoenix Park and Waterstown Park. It has huge potential. The funding that is available for that involves a feasibility study relating to restoring the bridge, connecting the two parks and developing a greenway and facility along the Liffey. I would hope that projects like that would be considered in terms of this scheme. While it is right in the heart of Dublin, it addresses the issue of tourism and the greater issue of healthy living and exercise. I hope projects like that would be considered in the same way as rural projects.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	When I was in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, there were some schemes there, particularly for cities and bigger towns. I want to make it clear to the Deputy that the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme opened on 1 June, the closing date is 27 July and it is open to everybody. Every application will be considered on its merits. I will set out the guidelines. It is a three-phase scheme. Measure 1 is for small-scale small maintenance or promotion of existing infrastructure where the maximum grant payable is €20,000. Measure 2 involves medium-scale repair or upgrade and new trail development where maximum amount payable is up to €200,000. Measure 3 involves larger-scale repair or upgrade and new strategy trails and development where the maximum amount payable is €500,000. I am talking to some State agencies at the moment to see whether they will come and support me with further funding but this funding is there. This is funding from my Department. I will talk to the State agencies to see whether they might top up some of these schemes. Local authorities can make ten applications for smaller schemes, four for medium schemes and one for a big scheme so they must prioritise the scheme or schemes they want - one large scheme, four medium schemes or ten smaller schemes. If a project is worthy of support and the application meets the criteria set out by the Department, it will be considered regardless of whether it involves a rural or urban area.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 224 together. I am leading a Department whose mission is to help build vibrant and sustainable communities across the country in both rural and urban areas. To do this requires a mix of policy initiatives and actions to improve economic development and to address gaps in meeting the social needs in these areas. Many of these initiatives form part of the Government's published Action Plan for Rural Development and framework policy for local and community development which include a range of measures which will contribute significantly to addressing isolation and social inclusion in communities. The Department is committed to the successful delivery of a number of programmes which will greatly benefit rural and urban communities. These include the new five-year social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which runs from 2018 to 2022 and is our country’s primary social inclusion intervention. It is a €190 million national programme that is delivered locally to help those in the greatest need. The new community enhancement programme, which I launched last month, will provide capital grants worth €4.5 million to projects which target disadvantage. The new version of the seniors alert scheme came into effect on 1 November 2017 and has seen a surge in demand. The Leader element of the rural development programme 2014-2020 will provide €250 million in financial resources to address the challenges facing rural areas over the course of the programme period, particularly under the themes of economic development and social inclusion. I launched CLÁR, a targeted investment programme for rural areas, in March 2018. The programme provides funding for small-scale infrastructural projects in disadvantaged rural areas that have experienced significant levels of depopulation. The town and village renewal scheme is another initiative under the Government’s Action Plan for Rural Development and is part of a package of national and local support measures to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland. Funding of €15 million has been earmarked for the 2018 scheme and it is hoped that up to 200 projects will be approved for funding this year. All this funding will bring benefits to rural and urban communities by addressing isolation.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	I thank the Minister for a comprehensive reply. We all recognise the important role he has to fulfil in restoring public confidence in rural Ireland and in areas suffering from social deprivation, perhaps over a long period. I want to ask about the degree to which the Minister might direct attention to particular areas. Notwithstanding the applications that will be made by various communities throughout the country, it is also important that he identifies projects in particular areas, with a view to restoring the kind of public confidence in all areas, rural and urban, that is required. There has been a tendency in recent years to run down the morale of communities in both urban and rural settings, with obvious detrimental effects on encouraging investment. What issues might the Minister focus on to restore public confidence in those areas?
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I will allow Deputy Fitzpatrick to make a brief comment.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	Will the Minister outline the amount allocated under the local improvement scheme in 2018, both nationally and in County Louth, and whether there will be an additional round of funding?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I agree with Deputy Durkan that we should not demoralise community groups and, instead, we should support and help them. If we did not have these community groups to help provide certain social services, we would have a serious problem where Government or State agencies are not providing those services. That is why, earlier this year, I looked at the situation of some of these community groups in regard to the funding I had available. Whether it is the Tidy Towns or a show, for example, these give a village or a town a lift. That is why I launched the community enhancement programme through the amalgamation of two programmes, and provided €4.5 million. I let that funding move down to the LCDCs, into the local communities, so they can identify where the local needs are. I do not want people to allocate funding to an area that does not need it. I want to make sure the people on these committees identify where the needs are, and that is why we have put the funding in place. The seniors alert scheme has been raised by the Deputy on many occasions. While there was funding in the kitty, it was not being drawn down. I will answer a question on that scheme later.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	I wish the Minister well in his important work in this area. Might it be possible to engage in a public relations programme on the restoration of pride in local areas? Restoration of pride is important, both for people living in the area and people who look at the area to live in or invest in. It would be of huge benefit if the Minister was seen to be restoring pride in local areas, whether urban or rural, and creating the aura of confidence that is necessary for business and communities to survive.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	I compliment the Deputy because, while he may not believe this, I asked departmental officials this week to look at organising a community weekend. We have a problem in this country in that people living in local areas do not know one another. My neighbour came in to me on Monday just when I was leaving for Dublin, and handed me a leaflet explaining there was a get-together on Friday night in my area. There are a number of people living in the area but we do not know each other because we are all busy, moving around and working. There are young people and families with young children who do not have an opportunity to meet. We are, therefore, having a get-together on Friday night. I have asked my officials to sit down and look at this, and we are going to have a community weekend where people will get to know one another again. They might have a street party or might go into one another's houses, and at least introduce themselves to one another. What has happened is that people are getting busier and working harder, and they sometimes do not have the time for a social life. If they met their neighbours for even half and hour or an hour, they would at least know they are there for one another. I compliment the Deputy on the question.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	Deputy Heydon did not get to take his Question No. 6 earlier. He believed there would be five Priority Questions when there were only four today. I have the prerogative to allow him to ask his question now but I would like to get the agreement of the House. I intend to accommodate Deputies Willie Penrose, Maureen O'Sullivan and Niamh Smyth afterwards. Is it agreed to allow Deputy Heydon to take his Question No. 6? Agreed. I ask the Deputy to forgo his introductory remarks and to limit his contribution to one supplementary question.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	I launched the 2018 town and village renewal scheme on 27 April this year with an allocation of €15 million for projects which will run over a 12 to 18-month period. Local authorities are required to seek expressions of interest from communities for proposals under the scheme, and each county has been invited to submit up to 12 proposals to my Department for consideration. The closing date for the submission of applications is 30 June. During July, my Department will assess all the applications received, with a view to announcing successful projects as soon as possible thereafter. Projects will be expected to commence before the end of the year and should be completed by the end of 2019. Successful proposals are likely to include activities which have clear positive economic impacts on rural towns and villages. They will also demonstrate close collaboration between communities and business interests in the design and delivery of the projects. More than €31.6 million has been approved for over 450 projects across the country since the town and village renewal scheme was introduced in the second half of 2016. I anticipate that up to 200 further projects will be approved through the €15 million being allocated under the 2018 scheme. The scheme is an important part of the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development. The Government's commitment to supporting rural Ireland is further demonstrated through Project Ireland 2040, which will result in the creation of a new €1 billion rural regeneration and development fund, which I will launch shortly. The new fund will provide an opportunity to deliver ambitious and integrated projects which will further support the revitalisation of our rural towns and villages.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair. I thank the Minister for his response. Kildare has experienced positive benefits from the town and village renewal scheme to date. I agree with the Minister's point about collaboration with local business and that economic activity and drivers are crucial. We have seen this in Ballymore Eustace with the €92,000 towards the walking trail, which will have a direct tourism benefit. It is also evident in Narraghmore, where €80,000 in funding will contribute to the development of a country market in an old hardware premises that was disused and had fallen down. Likewise, €100,000 has been provided for Monasterevin and the €67,000 in funding for CCTV in Athy shows the flexibility in the scheme, as well as the €95,000 for the upgrading of the town square. We are working closely with Kildare County Council on applications for this year and we are also working with local communities in areas that hope to submit applications.Kilcullen and Rathangan are two towns, in particular, where we have considered a public benefit element and I hope their applications would be looked on favourably. I hope further applications will be submitted by Castledermot, Monasterevin and beyond. I thank the Minister for opening up the scheme. It is beneficial and we look forward to working with him.

He was correct that this has been a positive scheme with tremendous work being done. In his county, €796,403 has been allocated to a number of projects, some for which he lobbied hard. They are making an impact and the town and village renewal scheme is working well. I want the scheme to continue. I hope we will see some good projects on foot of it.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	I am somewhat flummoxed at the thought of the Minister not knowing everyone in Westport. He has received a submission from my colleague, Mr. Seamus Rodgers, a former councillor in Donegal who is concerned about the islands. There has done much work for islands not only off the coast of Donegal but off the west coast. There are some islands in the Minister's area and he knows the cost associated with maintaining the road networks for the island communities. It is much more expensive than it is for inland communities.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I thank the Deputy for his question. Statutory responsibility for the development and improvement of roads, including those on offshore islands, lies with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. However, since 2017, my Department has funded a local improvement scheme, which is a scheme for carrying out improvement works on private non-public roads. Often these roads lead to multiple houses, parcels of land that support agricultural activity, or amenities such as lakes, rivers or beaches. The scheme is funded by my Department and delivered in conjunction with the county councils which administer it and carry out the improvement works. The county councils assess and prioritise the roads for improvement works and advise my Department of the projects they intend to carry out within their funding allocations. A local contribution is also made to the cost of the works.  It is solely the responsibility of the local authorities to select and prioritise the road projects that will received local improvement scheme funding in their areas, including on the offshore islands, in line with the scheme criteria and the council's funding allocation.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	The allocation is not sufficient, as it takes much more resources to repair roads on the offshore islands. It is vital we provide supports for access and egress for the islands. The road network is vital for our island communities in terms of transport, employment and fisheries. The local authorities may allocate funding to the islands but it might only cover the cost of road maintenance for 1 km of road compared to 2 km elsewhere because of the significant impact of erosion on the islands. We want to ensure the sustainability of our islands to enable people to live on them. The former councillor, Seamus Rodgers made a detailed submission to the Minister. I ask him to review it to ensure some progress and to work in collaboration with the NTA, which might not be aware of our islands, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the local authorities. The Minister's Department is critical and pivotal in ensuring and highlighting the importance of our island communities and the protection and enhancement of facilities, including the road infrastructure.

There are three islands in my constituency, although I acknowledge there are not many in the midlands.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	There are none.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I compliment my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Kyne who opened up a scheme for the islands. Deputy Penrose was correct in pointing out that the islands incur extra costs to transport materials in and out of them. I would like co-operation between the local authorities, the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and my Department. The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, has responsibility for both Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht islands. There should be a scheme to assist island communities. They are a special case and have a special need. It is important we maintain and look after our islands. They are a great tourist attraction and we want people to live and work on them and to be able to travel on roads of a good standard. I lobbied for island communities in recent years, as I have three islands in my constituency. The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, opened up a scheme when he had responsibility for the Gaeltacht. We had other plans and we hope to continue with them.

#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together. My Department is currently finalising revised dog breeding establishment guidelines, taking account of the submissions received during the public consultation process, a summary report of which has been published on the Department's website. In recent months, departmental officials have been engaging with the members of the original working group and with other stakeholders to ensure that the revised guidelines reflect, where appropriate, the views received during the consultation period. I expect to have the revised guidelines ready for my approval to publish later this month. That is a commitment I gave in February in responses to parliamentary questions in the Dáil.  I want, and I am sure we all do, the highest standards achieved by dog breeding establishments in Ireland and will oversee the progression of any necessary legislative changes required in this area. My immediate priority is to finish work on revising the guidelines. Amendments to the relevant legislation, if necessary, will be progressed subsequently. My Department is currently identifying legislative amendments that may be required. Broader issues relating to enforcement and licence conditions were also raised in the public consultation. I have asked my officials to consider whether further measures are required in these areas. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the enforcement of animal welfare standards for all animals, including dogs, is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the Animal Health and Welfare Acts. Both Departments work closely with each other to ensure a co-ordinated approach is taken in this area.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	There is an urgency about these guidelines given the dreadful reputation Ireland has as the puppy farm capital of Europe. The conditions on puppy farms are poor and there is a lack of enforcement of regulations. Deputy Clare Daly and I constantly receive calls from individuals, organisations and animal welfare groups about those conditions. I checked the DoneDeal website this morning. It has 2,000 advertisements for the sale of puppies and that does not take into account the number of puppies available in each. We know the appalling conditions on some of the farms. These are all the issues that must be taken on board. The rescue communities have to pick up the pieces and while they are being funded, it is not sufficient. The puppy farms are a profit-making operation, churning out puppies all the time. We read of the seizures being made by customs officers practically every week. For example, a couple of puppies were seized last week. They puppies have to be rehoused and retrained and the animal welfare groups take all that into account. Having regard to what the Minister of State said in his reply, I hope there will be much better conditions and improved enforcement.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy. We all recognise the important issues regarding puppy welfare. A number of submissions were made during the public consultation process. I expect to publish the revised guidelines by the end of this month. We can also be positive about some of the changes that have been made under the Animal Welfare Acts, including microchipping, and the trends in dog control statistics. The total number of dogs euthanised in local authority pounds was 996 in 2017 compared to more than 1,600 in 2016. That indicates a continuation in the annual decline in the number of dogs being euthanised, which is down from a high of more than 21,000 in 2002. There is positivity in the area, notwithstanding the issues that have arisen. At the end of December 2016, 248 dog breeders were registered with the local authorities and 275 inspections of dog breeding establishments took place. The total number of dog breeding establishments on the register with local authorities at the end of December 2017 was 258.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	The problem with inspections is that they are scheduled by appointment and, therefore, the dog breeding establishment knows when the inspector is coming. There needs to be on-the-spot appointments. If a fault is found, a notice is given to improve. Enforcement is not strong enough. There are two other aspects, one of which is related to revenue. We need to consider the number of dog breeding establishments in Ireland and their revenue. I have been trying to pursue that with the Minister. There is also a serious environmental issue. Hundreds of dogs are being bred on puppy farms and there is the issue of dog poop and what is happening in that regard. In his response to a Topical Issue matter I raised with the Minister previously, he agreed that the scope of the existing guidelines needs to be enhanced because they are benign. They represent a minimal standard that is no longer acceptable. We need to move much more radically on this issue. Responsibility for animal welfare comes under three Departments - the Minister of State's Department, and the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.When it falls between the cracks like that, abuses take place. Another question is whether puppy farms should exist at all. Puppies are not livestock and are not bred for slaughter or food production. I hope that the guidelines will be more robust and have severe enforcement aspects.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	The consultation was robust and there were a number of submissions which we expect to be able to take on board. I note the Deputy's concerns about this being a cross-departmental issue. Some of the submissions also made that point and were of the view that it should be entirely within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, where vets have a role. The local authorities, which fall under a separate Department, have ultimate responsibility for enforcement. There is good collaboration, however, between the Departments, vets and local authorities. My officials have engaged with the relevant stakeholders, for example, local authorities and vets under the auspices of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, the ISPCA and Dogs Trust, on revising the draft documents. The Deputy is right concerning Buy N Sell, DoneDeal.ie and so on. She can take up the Revenue issues with the Minister for Finance, but it was a valid point.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 16 together. I thank the Deputy for her question. The town and village renewal scheme is a key component in revitalising towns and villages and sustaining our rural communities. It was introduced in 2016 and allocated €10 million to 170 projects in its first year of operation. In 2017, as part of the Action Plan for Rural Development, I launched an enhanced town and village renewal scheme with a focus on projects that could bring a positive economic impact to our rural towns and villages. Under last year's scheme, I approved €21.6 million in funding to 281 projects. I launched a further round of the scheme in April of this year, with an allocation of €15 million. The closing date for the submission of applications to my Department is 30 June and I anticipate that up to 200 further projects will be approved arising from this call for proposals. These projects will be completed over a 12 to 18 month period. In addition, my Department provided €7 million in CLÁR funding to 231 projects in 2017. More than 400 applications have been received under this year's CLÁR programme and I will be announcing details of successful projects shortly. I also allocated €1.4 million to Tidy Towns committees throughout the country last year to mark the 60th anniversary of the competition in 2018. I made €812,000 available towards the running costs of agricultural shows around the country. These shows attract many extra visitors to rural towns and villages. The new €1 billion rural regeneration and development fund, which was announced by the Government recently as part of Project Ireland 2040, will provide an opportunity to deliver ambitious and integrated projects that further support the revitalisation of our rural towns and villages. I will be announcing full details of the fund later this month. On the basis of the progress made to date, the target in the Action Plan for Rural Development to support the revitalisation of more than 600 rural towns and villages over the period 2017 to 2020 will be exceeded. My objective is to ensure that the investment made in these towns and villages has a sustainable impact that will make them more attractive places in which to live and work and to visit.

His remit, particularly in terms of the Action Plan for Rural Development, has the potential to do much for towns and villages, which have been stripped of services down the years. Their post offices, Garda stations, shops and banks have closed, but the Minister has it within his gift to put fire in the belly of communities to see a revitalisation of their towns and villages. Of the €21.6 million that the Minister allocated for 2017, how much has been spent? Will he meet his target? What are his ambitions for the 2018 allocation? Will there be an increase in the action plan or will that stay as is? The Minister referred to CLÁR funding. Tunnyduff national school in my community is dependent on such schemes. We are into the summer months and the school is breaking up for the summer. The announcements were meant to be made in May. I hope that the Minister will clarify when they will be made.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I thank the Minister for introducing these schemes in recent years. They have been of considerable benefit to rural Ireland. CLÁR, town and village renewal schemes, community involvement schemes, CIS, and local improvement schemes, LIS, have been crucial. Will there be a timescale this year for money to be spent under town and village renewal schemes? Will there be a definite funding stream annually? Will the amount be the same or will it grow in subsequent periods?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	I thank the Deputies for their questions. I will not be political, but there have been many closures of small shops in recent years. They are finding it difficult thanks to the Internet and so on. People sometimes forget that many small shops are closing because multinationals have entered their areas. I have seen this happen in my own area. It is not always a good thing. I would prefer small shops employing local people, but that is how life has turned. Deputy Smyth asked a valid question about the CLÁR programme. I am trying to get the scheme out as quickly as possible. The Deputy is correct in that many CLÁR programmes deal with lighting, safety schemes for schools, etc. They need to be notified quickly because they would like to get the work done between now and September. I am putting pressure on the Department to try to get the announcements made as quickly as possible. As the Deputy knows, there are three aspects to the scheme. I will try to get the safety element in particular announced as soon as possible, as that important work needs to be done while schools are closed. Both Deputies asked whether there would be further funding for the town and village renewal scheme. I have sat down with local authorities. A stream of funding is guaranteed for the next number of years. To be fair to local authorities, they did not have the capacity to deliver some of these schemes because they did not have funding. Now that they know that there will be a continuation of funding for a number of years, they will be able to build capacity and employ people and the schemes will continue. The town and village renewal scheme will last for 18 months. We expect that any funding allocated this year will be spent in 2019.
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	Has the Department met its targets for 2017's €21.6 million? Has all of it been spent? Will the Minister increase funding for the Action Plan for Rural Development in 2018? He mentioned small shops in towns being crucified by large multinationals, but the main problem is broadband. It is a major issue for the Government in the revitalisation of towns and villages throughout the country. The Minister is right, in that many shops have been put to the pin of their collar because of online purchasing, but it is up to the Government to ensure that broadband is available in our small towns and villages so that they can compete with multinationals and online buying. The Minister's Department will play a pivotal role in putting fire in the belly of communities throughout the country.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	One of the main advantages of the town and village renewal scheme has been how it has given communities another opportunity to re-engage with themselves in the first instance, join together and formulate plans. That approach has been missing in recent years. An important element is something that the Minister referenced in a previous answer. Extra staff need to be available to assist communities in putting action plans and applications together. Some applications can be detailed, so assistance is required. Is the Minister confirming that extra staff will be available at local authority level to assist communities in that regard? I believe I heard him say that in a previous answer.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	In 2016, I approved an allocation of €9.8 million. Of that, €9.7 million was spent. That is 92%. The point that Deputy Deering raised was one of the complaints that I received from local authorities. I met the CCMA, which complained that many schemes had landed on authorities quickly and they did not have the necessary resources.They know now. I actually wrote to them to give them a timeframe indicating when the schemes would open, when they would be closed and when they would be announced. Now they know that there will be a continuation of funding for the next several years and they can plan for that. They could not plan for it in the past. 
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	In April, the country was shocked and appalled by the revelations made by Vicky Phelan about her cervical smear test and how she had to go to the High Court to fight for justice, even though she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Vicky agreed to waive her right to privacy and also refused to sign a confidentiality clause, as she wanted other women to be made fully aware of her experiences. We then heard the heart-rending radio interview given by Emma Mhic Mhathúna, a young mother of four from Kerry who had also been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Both of these women, and many hundreds of others, were unaware that an audit had taken place which showed that they had false negatives. Some 209 women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer were not told about subsequent audits showing that previous smear tests could have brought about a different outcome. The Government committed to introducing mandatory disclosure in 2015, and it has indeed been HSE policy since 2013. Yet it was exposed at the Committee of Public Accounts that CervicalCheck, the HSE and the Department of Health were informed and the audit results were knowingly withheld from the women affected. As we know, the head of CervicalCheck immediately resigned her post and the CEO of the HSE left. It was and still is a national scandal. It has been an intense and emotional few weeks for the women and their families. It still continues. Even this morning at the Committee of Public Accounts, CervicalCheck and the HSE had to apologise to members and to the State Claims Agency for giving them incorrect information to the effect that all women affected had been told. The fact that Dr. Gabriel Scally, who was appointed by this Dáil to carry out the scoping inquiry on 8 May, has not been given all the information he requires to do what the Government and the Dáil asked him to do is absolutely outrageous. I agree with Dr. Scally when he says that it is unacceptable. He has rightly said that he will not be stonewalled. Yet there are agencies of this State willing to drag their feet, put up obstructions and continue to behave in an inexcusable defensive manner to the Government, the Dáil and most importantly the women involved, on the basis that they believe their actions are defensible. These women, who want to get their records to examine exactly what happened, unfortunately do not have the luxury of time. The scoping inquiry was to be completed at the end of June. It has now been delayed until approximately the end of summer. I know that the Government wants the scoping inquiry completed as soon as possible, but now it looks as though that will not happen. In the scoping inquiry, information is being denied and delayed unacceptably for various administrative, medical, legal and other reasons. Does the Minister believe it is acceptable that it has taken a full month to send documents to the scoping inquiry, and that these documents were not sent in an accessible form to the inquiry team, particularly when a deadline of the end of June was set? Does the Minister accept that the scoping inquiry is being buried under a mountain of paperwork and that the women affected deserve better? Finally, does he not agree that at this stage it would be more prudent to set up a commission of inquiry now, so that information can be sought rather than dragged from the agencies involved and so that a resolution can be found sooner rather than later?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It is an extraordinarily serious matter and the Government is taking it very seriously. As the Deputy knows, this was something that was never brought to the attention of the Minister or any previous Minister. The Government has set up a serious incident management team to address this, and as the Deputy acknowledged, a number of changes at senior level have been made. The scoping inquiry has been put in place and yesterday the Minister was absolutely clear, as was the Taoiseach, that full co-operation with the Scally inquiry is demanded of every agency. Moreover, serious unhappiness was expressed by the Minister with the fact that the documentation provided was not in searchable form, which made it difficult for Dr. Scally to do his work. The Minister has made it categorically clear to Dr. Scally that no such interruption in his work will be tolerated, and the Minister has been in touch with the HSE to confirm that. As the Deputy knows, the Government sanctioned the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to work with the women affected. They are working with them case by case and meeting them on an individual basis so their concerns can be fully addressed. In the interim period, Dr. Scally has made some very worthwhile proposals. He has made it very clear that guarantees should be given to women in the consent form that they will receive the information and that full disclosure will occur if any change in information from those smear tests is discovered. New guarantees will be put into the consent form and the HSE has indicated that will happen immediately. In addition, new information notices are being provided to anyone doing these tests, so that it is very clear to women that there is a possibility of a smear test not being accurate. That is categorically provided. In addition he recommended that women's expenses should be provided for. A payment of €2,000 has been provided immediately, so that no woman has any difficulty in accessing the services that are being made available. The Government has also provided a care package. This is being rolled out to women who need it so that they can have access to care and to support for any expenses that arise. This inquiry is really important. I believe the Deputy's question was addressed yesterday by the Taoiseach. He pointed out that a commission of inquiry results in longer delays. Each person will have to be lawyered up. We have seen these commissions' record of running for a very long time. Many of these women do not have such long periods to wait. It is really important that Dr. Scally, who we appointed, is allowed to do the work effectively, as he will do. He has already proved his effectiveness in the interim report he has given.

That is why my party leader raised the matter earlier in the week. It is as though some of our State agencies cannot help themselves. They are dragging their feet on this. I asked the Minister earlier if he thought it was acceptable that it has taken more than a month for incomplete information to be sent to the scoping inquiry. All the Members of this House want to make sure that we find out the truth in a very timely fashion and most importantly that the women and their families find out the truth. However, a change of culture is needed. I actually believe that some of our agencies, the HSE and others, are still acting in a very defensive manner and defending the indefensible. That is why we firmly believe that a commission of inquiry needs to be set up, with powers to compel. I do not want us to come back in the autumn still discussing the problem of the scoping inquiry not getting the information that it needs. Can the Minister give us assurances and tell us what the end of the summer means in the context of the scoping inquiry? Will this be completed by the end of June? Will it be July? Will it be August? These women do not have the luxury of time, as the Minister himself has said.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	The Deputy will also be aware that in answering questions, Dr. Scally said that while he did not have the power to compel, he expected full co-operation and was getting co-operation from those he had approached. There is no evidence that people are refusing to appear before Dr. Scally. I think if there was any suggestion that he was being interfered with, the Minister and the Government would take immediate action. However, we are confident that he will have the opportunity to complete his work. As the Taoiseach indicated yesterday, it is the Government's intention to have a full commission of inquiry in due course. However, the reason all parties in this House believed that the scoping approach was appropriate is that we needed to get quick access to certain important information. We needed to ensure that the system was changed. Already as a result of his recommendations there are changes in the guarantees that are written in to the consent form.There are new information packages and new supports. This has come about almost immediately - within weeks - as a result of his work.

Like previous Governments before it, its record on health has been absolutely abysmal. Nowhere is this more evident than in the context of hospital waiting lists. Since the Government came to office, hardly a month passes without the number of people on waiting lists increasing. The figures have risen every month since last autumn, with the exception of a small reduction in February. The figures released by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, this morning are totally shocking. The figures for May are up 6,200 on the previous month and the overall number has increased by more than 20,000 patients for the year. This brings the total number of people on waiting lists in the State to more than 707,000. That is the highest number ever recorded in the history of the State. When he came to office, the Taoiseach said he would be taking a special interest in the issue of health. That special interest has amounted to overseeing an increase in hospital waiting lists to record highs. Such failure has not been confined to the issue of hospital waiting lists alone. Since Deputy Varadkar became Taoiseach, more than 106,000 patients have spent time on hospital trolleys. He has presided over a recruitment and retention crisis in our hospitals and, as we heard again this week, there is chronic underinvestment in our mental health services. There has been a significant increase in those over the age of 75 who have spent 24 hours or more in accident and emergency wards. If this is the Taoiseach taking a special interest in health, I am loath to think what it would be like if he did not take that interest. I do not want to absolve the Government's partner, Fianna Fáil, from its role in all of this. When it cobbled together its deal to put the Government in office in 2016, Fianna Fáil stated that it would ensure that a plan was put in place to tackle waiting lists. Look at the situation now. We have record levels, with 707,000 patients on hospital waiting lists. The problem can be addressed but it is a matter of priorities and choice, and of making the right choices. It can be done by removing private health care from public hospitals and ensuring proper oversight of private practice limits, by stopping State funds going into private interests through the NTPF, and by ensuring there is adequate public investment in funding of public hospitals so they do not have to raise their own funds. All of this can help to bring down waiting lists. It is long past time that the Government got serious about tackling this issue. It might be late in the day and one year on, but it is time for the Taoiseach to take a special interest in health and fulfil the commitment he made to the people and make meaningful changes that will result in these waiting lists coming down.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The investment in health is now at unprecedented levels. It is encouraging that 22,000 operations are conducted each week in our hospitals. That is a very high number. Admittedly, there is a waiting list of 79,000. When we think of the 22,000 being treated every week, however, it shows significant progress is being made. The number of 22,000 per week has increased, and it has risen in each of the past five years. We are progressively making progress on tackling the waiting lists. The outpatient waiting list is down. The number of patients waiting longer than nine months, which is the target for an inpatient or day-case procedure, is now down 5,800, so it is significantly down in comparison to the figures previously provided. We are making significant progress. The number of outpatients treated in our hospitals each week is 64,200. Again, this is a figure that is increasing all the time. There is a waiting list of more than 500,000 outpatients but the Minister is introducing a new outpatient action plan to address this. The Deputy is aware the NTPF has been reinstated. It has already very successfully treated 7,500 people so far this year, taking them directly off waiting lists. The Minister will now address the outpatient waiting lists, which do present a challenge. It is well known that there is duplication on those lists. We need to properly verify the lists. A strategy is being put in place - it is close to being finalised by the Minister - to address the specific issue of outpatient waiting. We have to bear in mind that this is also in the context of significant improvements being made in the broader health service. There is a strategy to increase investment in primary care centres and we see that throughout the country almost 100 additional primary care centres have been put in place. For the first time in 25 years we have new investment in hospital infrastructure. It is hard to believe no new hospital capacity was put in place in our health system for almost 25 years but, as the Deputy knows, the Minister is investing in a new children's hospital, a new maternity hospital and a new forensic hospital. He has indicated in his ten-year plan that significant investments are coming in order to address needs, with almost 3,000 additional beds - some of them exclusively in hospitals dealing solely with elective procedures - being provided. This will be a significant addition to the investment and the range of resources to address needs.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	I do not know what planet the Minister lives on, coming in here and making a statement to the effect that the Government is making progress on waiting lists despite the evidence. That evidence is not just coming from me or the Sinn Féin benches, it is contained in the report published this morning, which states very clearly that the numbers on waiting lists in the State have increased by 6,200 in the past month. Since the Taoiseach assumed office, the overall number has increased by 20,000. The report is very clear that we have the largest number of patients on waiting lists ever recorded in the history of the State. The Government tries to slice and dice the figures and present them in a way that makes it seem that great improvements are being made. The only thing that can be relied on is the NTPF, but we know that is a privatisation of the system and it will never work. What we need is investment in the public service. What we need is proper value for money. What the Government is doing with regard to the NTPF is siphoning off taxpayers' money into private health care that provides for routine and simple procedures which should be carried out in public hospitals. These are procedures that cost three times more than if they were carried out in a public hospital, but there is an ideological blind spot whereby the Government believes that underinvestment in public services and dishing it out to private services is okay.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	I will finish on this point. Sarah Burke of the centre for health policy and management in Trinity College nailed it when she said that over a decade of pouring hundreds of millions into the NTPF is proof it does not address the underlying causes and the long waits for public patients. Will the Government accept this reality and bring forward a proper programme which, at its core, has investment in the public service so we can end the shameful episode of having 707,000 patients on hospital waiting lists?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	103	To address the issue of waiting lists, the Deputy is right that 162,000 people joined the outpatient waiting list in the past three months, but in that time 832,000 outpatients were treated in our hospitals. We are delivering care. Of course, any system will have people who are joining the waiting list as it is not an immediate service, but most of these patients are there less than six months and 75% are treated within 12 months. There is a system and a pipeline for dealing with them. When it comes to investment, the Deputy will have read the recent investment plan. From memory, €10 billion is being invested in our health services and, as I said, this is the first series of investments in almost 25 years in expanding the capacity, not just of our hospital system but also of our primary care system, to address the needs of a growing population and an ageing population. We freewheeled through the so-called Celtic tiger years and did not make those investments, but they are now being made because the hard earned recovery we have achieved will be used in a prudent way and we will invest it in elective-only beds and additional capacity throughout the country.That is the way we invest. We will support the Sláintecare policy, which I understood had broad party support across the House, as a consistent strategy to address health in the long term.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	104	I have just come from a rather extraordinary meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts where we were joined by representatives of the Health Service Executive, CervicalCheck and the State Claims Agency to discuss contradictions in evidence. Those contradictions have not been cleared up. The evidence given to us leads me to one of two conclusions. Either the Minister is not being told everything or is being misled or else he is simply not on top of this matter. It could be one or the other. The Government must immediately find out what is going on. CervicalCheck is run out of Limerick and I have spoken to the people who work there. They are good people. I am sure there are issues at a management level but the ordinary workers are good people. Dr. Scally has never set foot in the place and has not met those workers. The head of the HSE met them once and has now acknowledged that he must meet them more often. Dr. Scally has never spoken to the man who is over CervicalCheck. This is the biggest healthcare crisis in this country in decades, but after this length of time he has not sat down with the director of the programme. How is that acceptable? I do not have a great deal of time for Dr. Scally's report but he was very clear that the provision of documentation was not acceptable. Does the Minister know what we found out in the past hour? The head of CervicalCheck offered full remote and electronic access to the programme's records but the head of the HSE, who was sitting beside the programme director, had never heard of that offer. He thanked him for the offer and said he would take it up. What is going on? All of this information is available but we are four weeks on and Dr. Scally has received a dump of information that is not readable or searchable. Nevertheless, the head of CervicalCheck, whom Dr. Scally has never met, offered electronic access to all this information through the HSE but it was turned down. Some people might say "cover-up" but I wonder what is going on. Will the Minister and his Government instruct Dr. Scally to visit Limerick and the programme manager immediately? Will the Minister for Health visit Limerick and the programme manager immediately? We now know there will be more than 209 women affected so will the Minister outline to the House the likely number of cases? Will he guarantee in this House that the Scally report will come back in time and the Dáil will be recalled at the end of August to discuss it and commence the commission of investigation? Without a Dáil sitting, it cannot begin. The Taoiseach has given much detail and many commitments in saying there will be no further court cases, but what work has been done by the Taoiseach and this Government with the State Claims Agency to ensure this? I am not seeing it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	I reiterate the point that the Government acted very swiftly to address what is an appalling issue. We have worked hard with the affected women to get them immediate support and ensure they can have access to professional services to advise them. We have brought in outside experts and not relied on internal experts. We have brought in UK gynaecology services for advice and each person is being treated respectfully. The State Claims Agency has indicated it will work with those who make claims and seek to facilitate mediation wherever it occurs. Of course, there is another party involved, namely, the testing services. The State Claims Agency represents the State and that has implications. It is very clear that the approach being taken is one of supporting those women and minimising the trauma in pursuing a case if that is what they seek. The Houses sought an independent outside expert and we did not seek to appoint someone perceived as somebody already within the system. We sought somebody from outside with the necessary expertise. For the Deputy to suggest that this person should have already met a range of individuals-----

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	It is up to Dr. Scally to order his own work. We have provided terms of reference for him. There has already been an interim report and in my experience - I am a long time around this House - it is not often we have an independent expert appointed to do an investigation of this nature who has come back within weeks with very concrete proposals that will support the affected women with financial support and provide guarantees on consent forms. They will be provided with far more information than they have been getting. It demonstrates that Dr. Scally is reviewing processes. Of course, in ordering his work he will meet all those whom he needs to meet. Dr. Scally spoke about the difficulty he has experienced getting the records he needed promptly and in a readable format. I understand the HSE has stated it provided as much as was available in an electronic format-----
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	That has been proven to be wrong.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	It is working to ensure the other documents will be searchable for Dr. Scally. We have assured Dr. Scally that he will have the support of all agencies of Government in getting access to the records he needs. It would be inappropriate for us to be issuing instructions to someone when we have decided for him to come here to do an independent scoping report. If we did so, the Deputy would be back here, rightly, saying that the Minister was interfering with the independent work of somebody appointed to investigate this matter. It is exactly what would happen.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	110	The Minister has refused to answer my questions. I asked very specific questions but he has not answered them. I will say it straight that if the Government does not deal with this matter soon, the lifetime of this Dáil will be shortened considerably. This is a scandal and the Government is not on top of it in any way, shape or form. Members of this House have more knowledge of some of these matters than members of the Government who are responsible for this. The decision of the Dáil was to give Dr. Scally this inquiry and that he would report by the end of June. That has unilaterally been changed by the Government and not the Dáil. We really need something that is scoped, with key decisions and terms of reference needed by a commission of inquiry. What is being outlined here will go on for an inordinate amount of time and, unfortunately, women will pass away while that is happening. They want answers and guidance. They want to know the facts. This will not come back by the end of August. It will hardly come back by the end of this year if it continues going this way. It has gone beyond what was the idea of this Dáil. I can see that. Women will need to tell their stories but first they need the facts to come out. It is not what will happen. I ask the Minister, who has refused to answer my questions, to go back to the Minister for Health and put my questions to him.

We cannot come back seeking to instruct Dr. Scally in a different way every week. The Deputy asked if there are cases other than the 209 we know of. I do not have that information available to me. Part of the response was to examine cases that did not come to the attention of CervicalCheck and have an audit.There were, as I recollect, 3,000 such cases. A process was being put in place to identify whether there were additional cases that would have emerged from those. I am sure that process is ongoing and that the Deputy can get information in the usual way from the responsible Minister to find out how that approach is developing.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	118	I am sure the Minister is aware that this is national carers week. It is our annual opportunity to express our profound admiration for the work that carers provide day in, day out. I am sure the Minister will join me in that sentiment. In my county of Tipperary, 7,041 people provide regular unpaid personal help to a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability. This amounts to 4.4% of the county's population. According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, a total of 195,000 persons were providing unpaid assistance to others on the last count, with the largest percentage increase seen among those aged 85 and over, where the number rose from 1,318 to 1,776, a rise of 34%, which is huge. I want to focus, however, on the very disturbing revelation that 3,800 children under 15 years of age are engaged in providing care to others, accounting for almost 2% of all carers in the State. That is almost 4,000 children, a shocking figure, spending their childhoods looking after their sick and disabled loved ones and family members. We have spoken in this House recently about the harsh and cruel way in which children were treated. Such actions were disgraceful, and it is right that we condemn them wholeheartedly and without reservation. It is my belief, however, that in a few years we will look back and be appalled at how we could have allowed or indeed forced these young carers to bear such an extraordinary emotional burden. How can it be right that children as young as 12, 13 or 14 are left to meet the physical and sometimes medical needs of their adult loved ones? How can we stand over this? We cannot. All of us in this House are aware of the challenges adult carers face, and how difficult it is for them to find even a moment for themselves because of a lack of home care supports or other care packages that will give them some semblance of respite. If this is the case for adult carers, can we even imagine what it is like for the thousands of child carers in this State who must juggle school life, full-time care of their loved ones and trying to see a friend for some fun or games or whatever else young children should be doing? I want the Minister to make a commitment to me today that this Government will put as much energy into addressing the scandal of child carers in this State as it has put into other child welfare issues. It would represent an appalling vista for us to allow this to go on. But for these children, many of their adult family members or loved ones would not have any care provided to them, and this is unacceptable. We must salute the carers, young and old, but young carers should not be forced to do this. I salute in Tipperary Councillor Richie Molloy, who is the manager of the carers in Tipperary, and all the carers who give of such valuable time. Will the Minister give me a commitment that he will rectify this situation?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for acknowledging the extraordinary work that carers do in our community. There is no doubt that a huge number of families have very active family carers way beyond the 60,000 who receive carer's allowance or carer's benefit. A huge level of voluntary support is willingly given to support loved ones within the family. The State has over many years provided good but not adequate services in this area. I have always been impressed by the community services in our health areas, the public health nurse on the front line, the gateway to many services, and the home help services that are provided and are increasingly being delivered. The Deputy will be aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has recently recognised that there are gaps in access to home care packages and that he has had a recent consultation, to which I am sure the Deputy contributed, whereby he has invited all people who have an interest in this to make submissions as to how we should develop a statutory home care service for the long term to support carers, be they adult carers or child carers. The Minister of State is well advanced in this work. There is an obligation on us in this House to recognise that home care is as important as, for example, nursing home care, in respect of which we have had for many years now, under fair deal, a reasonable certainty for families as to how they will be supported if one of their loved ones enters a nursing home. We have not had the same certainty in respect of home caring. We have had a mixture of tax breaks, respite grants, carer's allowance and access to home help. The Minister has recognised, however, that we need to integrate that into a more coherent service in order that carers, be they children, as Deputy Mattie McGrath said, or adults, have a sustainable support on which they can depend. This is clearly a priority. We spoke earlier about hospitals and their needs, but often the unsung heroes in our health system are the carers who silently provide care 24-7. The State must recognise them in a much more tangible way. I am very hopeful, therefore, that the initiatives that the Minister of State is taking in this area will be very valuable. The Minister of State has also taken steps to provide immediate access to general practice care services free of charge to people on carer's allowance or carer's benefit in order that some of their concerns and pressures are addressed. This is an area where public policy clearly needs to evolve, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is working hard to ensure this.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	We have had enough consultation. It is obvious - the Minister himself admits it - that carers need support for the valuable work they do. The provision of care by children, however, surely cannot be acceptable, and I am worried about the Minister's comments in this regard. On a related matter, in December of last year, the Minister, Deputy Harris, in response to a prominent "Carers in Crisis" special on RTÉ's "Prime Time", for which I thank RTÉ, announced legislation to ensure that all carers in receipt of carer's allowance could access GP services without charge. While Family Carers Ireland reads this as a step in the right direction, it believes it should be applied more broadly in order that all full-time carers, not just those in receipt of carer's allowance, would be prioritised in the roll-out of GP visit cards. Therefore, will the Government consider using the non-means-tested carer's support grant, rather than the carer's allowance, to validate those providing full-time care for a loved one for the purpose of allocating a GP visit card? Will the Minister incorporate this into his forthcoming legislation? Consultation time is over. The needs are obvious. We all appreciate the work carers do alongside the district nurses and home helps, but we need to have it recognised and we need the scheme proposed by the Minister to be expanded to include all carers.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	121	The Deputy is right that the period of consultation is over. The Minister must still evolve a set of proposals, however, and I think most people would not regard simply adjusting the respite grant, or the carer's support grant, as that €1,700 is now called, as an adequate response.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	122	I did not say that.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	123	It was one of the suggestions the Deputy made. Regarding his other suggestion of expanding eligibility for the GP card, there is clearly an ambition on the part of the Government to extend primary care to a greater number in order that they are not charged to visit a GP. All these issues, however, would have to be considered in a budgetary context. What the Government has clearly signalled through the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is that we need to develop a more coherent policy in this area which would embrace access not only to medical care, as Deputy Mattie McGrath says, but also to the kinds of supports carers need. This is a range of supports, and they have not been adequately delivered through the existing services, good as they have been for many years. This is why the Minister of State took the time and effort to ensure that the input of people such as the associations Deputy Mattie McGrath represents, but also individual carers, would be brought to bear on designing a long-term system which would be statutorily based, so it would be an entitlement set out in law.

I wish to ask the Minister about the home building finance Ireland Bill. The Bill has been announced, re-announced, recycled and regurgitated as far back as last October's budget, when the Government announced €750 million. This was a fund to assist building homes. Eight months later the Bill has not been published, yet apparently housing, in respect of which the Government is failing abjectly, is meant to be the Government's number one priority. The moneys have not been utilised, not one affordable house has yet been built, and no affordable house scheme has yet been launched.I have asked the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, repeatedly and he says he will do it. He seems to say he will do a lot but never gets around to it. What is the cause of the delay with this Bill? When can we expect it to be published and what timeframe has been given for the Bill to go through the House?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	126	I am glad to tell the Deputy that this Bill was approved by the Government this week. I am optimistic that it will be published very shortly. It makes provision for €750 million to be extended. From memory, it is hoped that the provision will allow thousands of homes to be built. It is a finance scheme so it supports access to finance to developers who have had difficulty getting access to finance. It is not by any means a free grant but will be charged at a commercial rate. It will come before the House when there will be opportunity to debate the Bill. The Business Committee will decide how quickly it can be moved through.

We all know that improvements are desperately needed in this area, particularly in respect of building capacity in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. The Ombudsman's annual report, which was published this week, highlights the shortfall in staffing levels within the CAMHS team and the effect that this has on children and young people. For some time, these teams across the State have been operating at 50% capacity. CHO1, which includes my county of Donegal, has the lowest level of staffing at 51% compared to the recommendations set out in A Vision for Change. That is completely unacceptable. We know the impact this has on young people and their families as well as the staff who are charged with their care. They all deserve better. Promises were made by Government last year to address the disastrous staffing gaps within CAMHS. We were told it would be addressed-----

Will the Minister recommit the Government to doing everything that can be done to ensure that this happens without delay and set out very clearly how it intends to bring those recommendations contained within A Vision for Change into reality?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	130	I understand the HSE is in the final stages of recruiting staff required to deliver a seven days a week mental health service. It has recruited 114 assistant psychologists and 22 psychologists to develop a primary care element. One difficulty in our system is that primary care has been underdeveloped and everything is going to a consultant-led service in CAMHS, so that is a very important part of developing an integrated service. The additional funds have been provided but there are undoubtedly gaps and there are difficulties in recruiting in this area, which has been acknowledged. In my area of responsibility, we are expanding very significantly the National Education Psychological Service, NEPS, because we recognise that increasingly mental health challenges appear in our schools and we must build the capacity at that stage, before access to any form of referral system to build greater capability and resilience in the system.

We have seen record levels of overcrowding on trollies and wards. Today the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has said there are 376 people on trollies across the country. I welcome that in the last week the Government took up my suggestion to advertise the post of chairperson of the HSE before advertising the post of chief executive. However, the Government, as part of this Dáil, is committed to Sláintecare. It is something I worked on for over a year as a member of the committee. Since January, it has been looking at recruiting for the role of executive director. There is an urgent need for reform of the health service. We have seen the position of chair of the HSE being advertised-----

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	The programme for Government contains a commitment to tackle the problems caused by increased casualisation and precarious work. There is also a commitment to strengthen the role of the Low Pay Commission in relation to in-work poverty. However, there is no commitment to allow workers to strive to seek these things. Today, workers across the country have had to walk out in protest in branches of Lloyds Pharmacies. Lloyds is not exactly a local friendly pharmacy. It is controlled by the biggest drug distribution company in the world, the McKesson company, which last year pulled in $125 billion in revenue and which had to make a €12 million settlement with the Government last year for overcharging medical card prescription fees. The McKesson company and its pharmacy chain are refusing to recognise the rights of those workers to join the Mandate trade union and those workers have had to walk out today in protest. Does the Minister think it is fair that a programme for Government can drag its heels on delivering on the issues that affect workers----

It will introduce the banding of hours so that where people have regular part-time work but which is not in a contract, employers will be obliged to put it in the contract. There will be other provisions to protect casual workers. It is very much part of the Government's strategy. On access to the WRC for disputes, I understand there is legislation which provides that workers can get access to the WRC even where an employer refuses to recognise the union.

Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, a State educational agency which deals with quality and qualifications issues, has consistently refused to engage with a company in my town of Clonmel. The Institute of Professional Training in Clonmel, which achieved provider status in 2013, having passed all FETAC audits after it spent considerable money and time, has been unceremoniously stood down. I have written to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on this matter but he has not replied. I have tried to engage with the chief executive of QQI who has refused to do so. I am asking the Minister, in the interests of transparency, to instruct the CEO of QQI, Dr. Padraig Walsh, to engage with this company and also with elected representatives. There is no accountability and this behaviour is unacceptable. No reasons were given for why having achieved accreditation for courses this was then withdrawn from the company.

Next Tuesday, will the Cabinet sit down and agree to allow us to debate at Committee Stage the Waste Reduction Bill that would tackle that issue in a very significant way? The Minister, Deputy Naughten, has been spreading all sorts of economic arguments. We want that debate at Committee Stage to allow this House decide the measures in it which are very similar to what the European Commission is calling on us to do. Why is the Government blocking it? How can the Government say that it cares for the environment and the issue of plastic pollution if it is refusing to allow this Bill to go to Committee Stage? Will the Minister bring this to his Cabinet colleagues next Tuesday and come back to the House on Tuesday afternoon to let us know whether the Government is serious about plastics or if it is just public relations?

It is shocking news and a shocking state of affairs. Obviously the Minister will not know the answer today but, on the basis that some of these young people have been left with lifelong impairments because they were misdiagnosed, what is the Government's intention in respect of the screening of staff? That is very important. Does the Minister think there should be an audit of all equipment being used? Will there be further investigation of this situation on the basis that the audiologist in question worked in other parts of the country? That audiologist has been suspended from working in this jurisdiction but it is necessary and crucial that the Government investigates this situation further to ensure that no other children have fallen into the net.

I refer to the courts and land conveyancing (amendment) Bill, which is promised legislation, and to a Private Members' Bill which I have drafted and left in the custody of the Minister.

Rowing Ireland is getting the same funding this year as it got in 2017, but it is now a senior rowing team of 11 world-class rowers and, as a result of this level of funding, it can only send a team to two of the three World Rowing Cup events this year. On 21 March, I asked the Taoiseach about this in the Dáil and subsequently wrote to him to seek funding for Gary and Paul O'Donovan to sell Ireland abroad. I have yet to get a reply to this request. It was appalling to read the headline in the Southern Star last week: "Funding shortage will force O'Donovan brothers to pay own way to World Cup II regatta". Why are we-----

The issue I am raising relates to psychiatric care and I want to speak about the south east in particular. SIPTU staff in the department of psychiatry in St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny have lodged their intention to take industrial action over patient safety concerns. This department consists of 44 beds, but due to overcrowding in May and June, patients have been admitted and then told they have to sleep on couches. If the matter is not resolved, shift nurses in the department will not take up duty until such time as the numbers are reduced to agreed safe levels. We cannot accept a situation in which our psychiatric nurses are forced daily to endure unfair and unsafe working conditions. We owe it to the very dedicated staff and to their patients to reduce admission numbers to previously agreed safe levels. This has been an ongoing problem for a long time in the south east. As I have said, there are 44 beds in St. Luke's in Kilkenny. Patients are being sent from all over the south east. There are as many as 50 or 60 patients there at one time, some sleeping in armchairs. This is not good enough for these very vulnerable people. We need a bed manager for the whole south east. There is a commitment to have 14 units in Clonmel. The sooner the HSE intervenes and opens these and relieves these patients, the better. We are going to have industrial action in St. Luke's within a fortnight if the Minister and the HSE do not intervene.

#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	On the same matter and under the heading "building further capacity in child and adolescent mental health services", from mid-July this year Waterford and Wexford may not have any consultant psychiatric services for children. This comes after the resignation of three psychiatrists who cited a totally unsuitable working environment and unsafe work practices. In an opening statement from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care we also learned "In short, the Irish health service is uncompetitive in recruiting and retaining the number of high calibre Consultants it requires." We also learned that in 2016 no applications whatsoever were received in respect of 44 consultant psychiatrist posts advertised. These positions were in the Sligo-Leitrim and Cavan-Monaghan areas, the Central Mental Hospital, the Carlow-Kilkenny area, Donegal, Longford, Westmeath, Laois, Offaly, Waterford, Wexford and Cork. Surely this is having a detrimental effect on the level of safe and effective care to patients. What is the Government going to do to solve this recruitment issue?

From 1 July this year three psychiatrists who look after children in the Waterford-Wexford area are going to resign because of the unsafe practices they have to work under in Wexford. These psychiatrists look after a population of up to 250,000 people. There are many children with these issues. Here we have a situation in which we have 3.6 people employed where there should be six. One of these is out on sick leave. We are going to end up with no psychiatrist for any child in the south east.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	163	On the same matter, central to the crisis, which is just one on the list of crises to which we continually refer which are presided over by the Minister's Government, is the issue of recruitment and retention. It is only weeks since a Sinn Féin Private Members' motion was passed which instructed the Government to prioritise pay as part of the recruitment and retention process. This has not been done. It is not good enough to say that we have to wait for the Public Service Pay Commission. Something needs to be done now. If we do not address the issue of recruitment and retention, we will continue to come into this House day after day and list off new crises within our health service. Recruitment and retention need to be tackled as a matter of priority.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23832	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	164	Deputy O'Reilly recognises that a very specific provision was made in the recent pay agreement that, where there is difficulty in recruiting in particular grades, there would be a process under which the Public Service Pay Commission would examine the case and come back to Government with specific recommendations based on the evidence. It is right that that approach be taken. I understand the issues the Deputies are raising because I see them myself in my own work. There is a huge surge in need in this area. I know the number of children being cared for in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, has increased by 40%. That is the number getting services, but there are still waiting lists and those lists are expanding. This is an area of very high growth in need. There is a real difficulty in recruiting not just in Ireland, but in other countries. One of the responses has to be to rebuild our primary care service in the mental health area, which we have neglected. We have relied too much on a consultant-led service and we need to develop a more coherent response in this area. That is what is being worked on.

#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for mandatory open disclosure of a patient safety incident, to introduce a mandatory requirement that the patient be provided with any additional information which later becomes available and for that purpose to amend the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 and to provide for related matters.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for granting me leave to introduce this Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 to correct the wrong which was made at the time to make open disclosure voluntary as opposed to mandatory. The decision by the Government, which was supported by a Fianna Fáil abstention, to make open disclosure voluntary was a mistake. We in Sinn Féin have always opposed making open disclosure voluntary. We, along with Independent Members and others in this House, voted to make it mandatory on 8 November 2017 during Report Stage on the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017. We were defeated that day, but this Bill seeks to right that wrong. A year earlier in a Joint Committee on Health debate on open disclosure, I argued forcefully for mandatory open disclosure.Indeed, I argued for it again on Leaders' Questions with the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, on 21 February last in light of the case of Ms Alison McCormack, who had a breast cancer misdiagnosis. The practice of keeping quiet when things go wrong is often prevalent in our medical culture and only a statutory duty of candour will address the situation.  Most recently the fallout from the CervicalCheck scandal has shown the limitations to a process of voluntary open disclosure. I welcome that the need for mandatory open disclosure with legislative underpinning is now accepted right across this House and was supported in the passing of a Sinn Féin Private Members' motion calling for mandatory open disclosure. It should not have taken another scandal to change the minds of those who wanted open disclosure to be voluntary, however. Telling the truth where there is a patient safety incident should be mandatory and legislatively underpinned to ensure this. Nobody believes the health service can be run without error or risk but people demand that it show compassion and be truthful and honest. That is not what has happened to date. This is not what happened with Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhathúna and others affected by the CervicalCheck scandal. It is not what happed with Alison McCormack and her breast cancer misdiagnosis. It is not what happened when there were errors leading to baby deaths and injury in Portiuncula Hospital and it is not what happened when there were errors leading to baby deaths in Portlaoise hospital. Section 2 amends the definition of "incident" contained in section 8(2) of the 2017 Act so as to provide that the term "incident" includes a patient-safety incident that has occurred within the previous five years. Section 3 amends section 12 of the 2017 Act. Section 12 of the 2017 Act is a key provision in that it provides the mechanism under which the open disclosure of a patient safety incident is made. Section 12 of the 2017 Act is amended by replacing "may" with "shall" so that the initial wording of section 12 concerning open disclosure of a patient safety incident would instead read: "Where a patient safety incident occurs in the course of the provision by a health services provider of a health service to a patient, the health services provider shall make, in accordance with this Part, an open disclosure of the patient safety incident". Section 4 of the Bill amends section 18(1) of the 2017 Act. Section 18(1) provides for the voluntary disclosure of additional information concerning a patient safety incident to the patient at any time after the initial disclosure has taken place. Section 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 18(1) of the 2017 Act in two ways - first, by changing from voluntary to mandatory the requirement to disclose additional information to the patient where it becomes available and, second, by requiring that the additional information be made available to the patient "as is reasonably practicable" rather than merely "at any time". In order for open disclosure to work, it must be mandatory and it must be legally underpinned. This Bill addresses the problems surrounding the current system and amends the Civil Liability Act 2017 to provide for a mandatory system of open disclosure in our health system. Collectively we have said we no longer want to see patients effectively having to go to war with the HSE to find out really basic information about themselves and their own treatment. This House was wrong when it voted to make open disclosure voluntary. I am proud that Sinn Féin did not support that but we now have an opportunity, regrettably in light of yet another scandal, to put that right.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	We are here today to speak about the identification by Tusla of the fact that the births of 126 individuals from St. Patrick's Guild were registered illegally. A cruel and inhuman past rises up again with a vengeance in Ireland. It is about the shaming of women. It is about the shaming of mothers. It is about how this shaming has been inherited by their children. I am truly sorry that this has happened. It is also about how lies, secrets and silences, allowed and accepted by Irish society and Irish churches in the past, continue to block access to information on one's identity and to restorative justice in the present. I hope and believe that we can change this and that we have a moral imperative to do so. From where does this moral imperative come? It comes from the voices of the people who were and continue to be impacted upon by the illegal practices surrounding birth registration and adoption practices in the not-too-distant past. I had the opportunity, along with my officials and advisers, to meet several of those to whom this matter relates and their advocates at the beginning of this week. We listened to their stories and to their analyses and recommendations on the changes required. One of the women, a survivor of Bethany, spoke about her arduous and painful search for her birth mother and how her desire for information was blocked at every turn. One day, she finally found her mother buried in a pauper's grave. With great dignity and courage, she purchased the grave, as an act of claiming identity without shame and to do the right thing where others had failed. Her story - and those of the people in the 126 cases identified and the countless others whose lives and rights have been violated because of past practices - demands that we act in multiple ways, to enable the right to information and the knowledge of identity for those who do not have it. These people's stories also demand that the right things are done about their records and that they are supported appropriately in the process, to recover who they are and the relationships that have been lost. We also need ways to enable truth-telling and remembering, so that we can make a transition to a new way of valuing women, mothers and children. Following on from my announcement of 29 May, I want to clearly outline the evidence and share with Deputies what we know to date. I will then outline the processes Tusla has in place and my plans to establish whether the practice is more widespread, either in the remaining St. Patrick's Guild files or in the files of other adoption societies. Finally, I will address the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 and the mother and baby homes commission of investigation. The issue that has arisen regarding certain Saint Patrick's Guild files is evidence of illegal birth registrations. In effect, babies were given to couples and registered as the children of those couples and not of the birth parents. There were no adoption orders. While there have been suspicions about illegal registrations for many years, it has been extremely difficult to uncover clear evidence because of the deliberate failure of those involved to keep records. On 25 May 2016, the records of the guild were transferred to Tusla. In the course of scanning the records, the issue of illegal birth registrations was identified. Tusla informed An Garda Síochána, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and my Department. Tusla validated the information against the records of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, and the General Register Office, GRO, which resulted in the identification of 126 cases. I moved immediately to inform Cabinet and to announce, on 29 May, that a process has been put in place to deal with these cases, led by experienced social workers. An illegal birth registration is potentially life-changing, so the State has a responsibility to reach a high level of certainty before it contacts the individuals concerned. This threshold has now been reached in the case of these 126 files. The information I put into the public domain came to light because the index cards contained the words "adopted from birth". This phrase raised suspicions and the cases involved were analysed further in conjunction with the AAI and the GRO. It has been concluded that these were illegal registrations. Of these 126 cases, 79 have never had contact with Saint Patrick's Guild or with Tusla. In the remaining cases, there has been some contact by the individual or a relative. In addition to these cases, Tusla continues to examine a further 16 in which there is not enough evidence at this point to determine whether illegal registrations took place. While I am making every effort to ensure that the numbers are accurate, I must caution the House that they will change as more records are examined. In particular, the AAI is aware of approximately 140 cases in which existing suspicions regarding illegal registration must now be revisited. A validation exercise is under way. We must reflect on the impact our actions will have on the people involved. In addition to possible psychological issues of identity, there are potentially serious issues regarding the correction of birth records and inheritance. We may well be called on to address further issues as they emerge. Neither Tusla nor the AAI is out to destroy, upset or split families. Their job is to provide information and support. The 126 cases have already been allocated to experienced information and tracing social workers. They will work in a measured and sensitive way and at the pace of the individuals concerned. The process will be respectful if those who have been illegally registered choose not to engage. It is also the case that there are people we will never be able to contact, as files may have been deliberately designed to conceal identities or people could be deceased. Once Tusla identified the issue arising from the index cards, it informed the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and An Garda Síochána. The records were scanned, they were shared with the commission and the Garda sought and have been given a sample of ten files. Let me be absolutely clear: a false registration is an offence. The Garda must review the evidence and make a judgement with the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, on how to proceed. I have no role in these investigations, nor should I. We need to know if there is further evidence of illegal registrations. I have appointed an independent reviewer to oversee a further analysis of relevant records held by Tusla and the AAI. Ms Marion Reynolds is a former deputy director of social services in Northern Ireland. She has been asked to report to me within four months of the work commencing. There are some 150,000 records at issue, of which 100,000 are currently in the custody of Tusla and the AAI and accessible to the reviewer. First, we need a well-planned analysis of the Tusla and AAI records to see if a major trawl is likely to give us hard evidence of illegal registrations. We must judge the likely incidence of cases that could actually be identified through the analysis and the scale of such cases. Then, I will be in a position to judge next steps. Some are calling for a full audit of all files and while I appreciate the motivation, our limited resources must be used as effectively as possible. The mother and baby homes commission of investigation is also examining adoption practices in the cases of mothers and children who were resident in the specialised institutions within its terms of reference. It is reasonable to anticipate that this examination will provide an insight into any potential irregularities involved. The commission is committed to investigating any such cases it comes across. During the week, I met people directly affected by illegal registrations, advocacy groups and members of both the Dáil and the Seanad. Many Members were part of a very useful and productive meeting yesterday, which also included colleagues from the Seanad. The focus has been on progressing the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016. Deputies will be aware that this Bill has passed Second Stage in the Seanad. The Bill seeks to respect the rights to identity and privacy. This is proving challenging because they sometimes conflict with each other. The Bill also creates offences of destroying, mutilating, concealing or falsifying records. All of the people I met this week, including Members of this House, all agreed on one thing, namely, that the Bill is urgently required.Everything changed on 29 May. What happened informed the wider public, the body politic and the media of the need to act. My intention is that the Bill will be enacted by the end of the year. At the centre of this are people who were lied to and denied information about their true identity. They need answers and explanations and the choice or opportunity to meet their birth parents. It is a matter of profound regret to me that safeguards put in place by the State were circumvented. My responsibility now is to oversee a sensitive process which seeks to give them finally the information withheld from them all these years. I thank the House for its attention and I look forward very much to the debate.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	185	I thank the Minister for her statement. Everybody was horrified with the outcome of the press conference she held regarding the 13,500 files. What was astounding for most people was the falsification of birth certificates. Up to that stage, while people might have been suspicious, once it was proven and demonstrated, that brought a new focus and spotlight on this issue. Prior to that many people on both sides might have been fearful about the declaration of a birth mother, but many did not suspect there was falsification, lies and untruths. It has now shifted to a different place. People now want the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 brought forward and I welcome the Minister's commitment, which she has reiterated numerous times, to do this before the end of the year. Following a weekend when there was a great deal of joy nationwide, a serious damper was put on that on the Monday evening. There was a touch of reality that while we might have come a long distance, we were brought back again. It was not good for adoptees to realise they might be getting a phone call to tell them they might have been falsely adopted and that the names on their birth certificate might not be their parents. I cannot imagine what it would have been like to have received that call. It must have been life shattering. The Minister referred to Tusla and social workers supporting these people, but the rug has been pulled from under them and their families on many levels. I worry whether Tusla has the resources and capacity to deal with this. While all of this is going on, there are also accountability issues because a criminal act has been committed and lies and untruths were told. As the Minister said, it is important that An Garda Síochána is subject to the scoping exercise and the work undertaken with Tusla because we need to know how this happened and why people in positions of authority allowed it to happen. We need accountability in this regard. The 13,500 comprise only one segment of the files because there are more than 150,000. How will Tusla approach this to select a reasonable sample to see where the agency will go from this? Many people will have doubts in the back of their minds. We must also acknowledge adoptive parents in all of this, some of whom have contacted me. They feel hurt because, in some cases, this revelation makes them look like they have done something wrong but they may not be in that cohort at all. They adopted for the right reasons at a point in time and they feel hurt and let down. The junior and leaving certificate exams commenced the week the announcement was made and adopted children felt a certain amount of pressure and hurt. While the truth was welcome, at all times we have to be sensitive about our language and how we discuss this. To be fair, everybody has been. The only way we can move this forward is through the legislation. Only yesterday I said that my party and I were prepared to work with the Minister to give her the support she needs. I am fearful regarding how we will marry the two. I do not know how we are going to do it. I attended the meeting the Minister mentioned. The advice of the Attorney General to her is that everything will be addressed in the amendments she will table. There will be a good robust discussion here and in the Seanad when the legislation is brought forward. Given the hurt experienced by people as a result of this, it would be unforgivable for us not to address the issue. It is important legislation, given Vótáil 100 and everything else. It might be uncomfortable to move this forward but we have to do so because it is the right thing to do. The minimum to which people are entitled is the truth. The Minister will be heading into the budget and making representations on funding for Tusla. We will have to consider how we will support these families because it is not just individuals who need support. The people affected are aged between 19 and 50 and possibly older. They have families. There are various cohorts who will need support and we, as a State, owe it to the affected people to give them this support. The Minister wants to do this at all times. I do not know what it would have been like to have received the phone call to say a birth certificate had been falsified. These people have gone through their lives not knowing the truth and then finding out that those whom they thought were their parents were not. That must have been devastating for them. We will be there to support whatever needs to be done over the coming months. Bringing forward the amendments is crucial. The Adoption (information and Tracing) Bill 2016 is essential. The time for talking has to stop and we just need to get on with it. I look forward to the Minister tabling the amendments on Committee Stage.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	I wish to share time with Deputies Kenny and Ó Caoláin. I thank the Minister for her statement and for all the work she has done to date on this issue. As I said during Question Time yesterday, we were not surprised by the scandal of the illegal adoptions by St. Patrick's Guild because survivors and many journalists have been telling us the stories for years. Anybody who has met women incarcerated in mother and baby homes has heard these stories far too frequently. Now we finally have the evidence regarding what was going on. We need to start by not using the term "incorrect registrations". That term makes it sound like it was an accident or a mistake. Clearly, it was no accident. Using that language is insulting to the mothers whose children were taken off them and to those illegally adopted. This was a blatant attempt by adoption agencies to cover up what I believe was child trafficking. This week we have read that there are concerns regarding a further 700 cases at St. Patrick's Guild. These concerns relate to the changing of names on records, cash transactions and other practices.Many of those affected are also unlikely to be citizens of this State. Many may have been illegally adopted by families in Britain or the United States and are probably unaware of their links to Ireland. I hope we will see an investigation with a greater scope. This brings me to the sampling exercise announced by the Minister, which I welcome, albeit with major concerns. A sampling exercise will not cut it. It may be an acceptable approach in the short term but we must recognise that we are investigating the illegal adoption of children. It needs to be a thorough investigation. That is the only way to ensure that those who were illegally adopted but are unaware of it can get the full truth and support from this State. We cannot leave people behind. Many of the records of the illegal adoption of these children are still being held by religious organisations. Yesterday, the Minister stated that there are over 100,000 records in the possession of the State, with an estimated 50,000 still in the possession of these societies. These societies know that a sampling exercise is under way and I am concerned about the potential to tamper with records. I urge the Minister to act to ensure that every single item of documentation is handed to Tusla immediately. The Government must ensure that all necessary resources are provided for a thorough investigation into this scandal. We are at a point where we could be losing something in this debate. St. Patrick's Guild and other involved agencies were regulated by the State so the State allowed this to happen. It is now up to the State to do everything in its power to right these wrongs. I will briefly touch on the Adoption (Information and tracing) Bill 2016. The Minister has spoken with many of us in the House and we know she is enthusiastic about getting the Bill through. This must be done right despite all the emotion. We have heard groups talking about concerns and we must ensure everybody's concerns are addressed in this Bill. We will support the Minister in whatever way we can to get this Bill through the House and finally ensure that adoptees have the information they need.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	187	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic. I acknowledge the work of the Minister to try to advance matters. The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 needs further work and amendment. It must ensure there is unfettered access to all records for all people involved, which is the key in all of this. Standing back and thinking about how we came to this and many other scandals, it is about a hidden Ireland in the past. In many ways, it was an oppressive place. These children, whether coming from mother and baby homes, orphanages or wherever else, were treated almost like a commodity rather than the human beings they were. I will use today's opportunity to speak about a part of this group of people that has not been mentioned in the debate so far. Where I come from in Country Leitrim, a rural area of which the Acting Chairman might be aware, we had people called "home boys". There was a man in Carrigallen when I was growing up who had long whiskers and a long coat; he was always the butt of a joke and he lived in a little house in Drumbreanlis. I knew another man, Mr. Johnny Golden, who came to a very sad end, unfortunately, and he was also a home boy. There were many of them. They came from these homes and lived with farmers when they were perhaps 12 or 13. They had grown up in an institution and had no clue of family life or rural living. They had no clue about anything. They were very poorly educated and many of them could hardly read or write. In many places these people were treated very well but, sadly, in many places they were not treated well at all. In many homes they were treated very poorly. It is another sad reflection on the society in which we lived. There was another man called Paddy McLoughlin who lived in the same parish as me. My parents are both in their 80s and they tell me that when they grew up in the 1930s, nearly every second house had a home boy. It was society's way of dealing with the issue. My mother went to England in the 1950s and said she often met these home boys after they had emigrated and she saw them in dance halls and Irish clubs around London. When they went to England, there was an equality that they did not have at home. I use this opportunity to state that such people and so many more were legitimate citizens of this State. This State is proud of them and how they rose above everything that was against them. They had the strength to live and survive in that terrible position. We must be proud of the contribution they made to our society and country. It should be acknowledged and the best way to do this is by ensuring we do right by them in legislation that we bring forward.

The adoption of children into loving, welcoming and caring homes in situations where all criteria set down by regulations are met and adoption is in the best interests of the birth parent or parents and the child should always be promoted and appreciated. The history of adoption in Ireland until recent years is tarnished by lies, cover-up and deceit. We are all now too aware of this history, and it has again come to the fore in recent weeks. We must ensure such nightmarish occurrences never happen again. It is my belief that to deny a person access to the very information that records their entry into this world is to deny them a very basic human right. Birth certificates were altered and disappeared, while in some cases they were destroyed. Children were taken illegally from parents. These actions were disgraceful and wrong in the extreme. There are difficulties in striking a balance between the right to one's identity and an expectation of privacy. I know the Minister has demonstrated a deep interest in addressing these historic wrongs. Foremost in her consideration must be those people who have grown up not knowing their birth parents, with many having been told blatant lies. Everything that can be done to now right this wrong must be done to assist these people. The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 should be prioritised for the earliest possible through both the Seanad, where it is currently, and the Dáil. I welcome that the Minister referred to these false registrations as illegal birth registrations rather than incorrect birth registrations. My colleague also mentioned that point. Some people, including those in the media, have continued to refer to them as such even as recently as this week. Everybody is entitled to the recording of both birth parents on a birth certificate, and if information not recorded at birth presents later in life and can be properly verified, the information should be added to the incomplete record so a new birth certificate can be issued accordingly.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	190	It is now over 20 years since Mike Leigh's movie "Secrets and Lies" explored the kind of tensions that a hidden adoption story can create in a family.In more recent years, the book and the film of the story of Irish woman Philomena Lee have evoked much debate about the sordid history of the trade in babies that was a common but a secret feature of Irish life for decades. In one sense it was surprising that the controversy over the faking of numerous birth certificates should have generated such an intense emotional reaction. The basic facts of these and other dubious practices have been known for quite some time. In another sense it is right and proper that the public should get to know again and again the personal histories of families torn apart, babies exiled and lives damaged forever by the actions of both church and State. The core political issue is one of fundamental human rights. A person should have the right to his or her personal history and should be allowed full tracing rights. I know there are many people buried in the Irish systems of administration and politics who think the sky will fall in if these rights are realised, but we have provided referendums on gay marriage, reproductive rights and divorce. This is the only issue still outstanding. Adopted people are still the only people who do not have fundamental human rights in this country. Our laws are quite deficient in protecting the exercise of this human right and all attempts to reform the law have come up against entirely unreasonable and sometimes just mysterious barriers that do not exist in other societies that have similar legal systems to ours. I have experienced these barriers as an adopted person in my own search for identity and contact with my birth family and as a politician - as Deputy, Minister and Tánaiste - advocating reform. Therefore, as someone who was adopted, I stress that it is absolutely urgent that we provide for legislation which allows people the right to their personal information. We need to implement the adoption tracing legislation as a matter of urgency in order that adult adoptees in Ireland can access their own records concerning their birth families. This Government has been stalling on this for two years. I know the Minister herself is committed to the issue, but the Government overall is inhibited by some mysterious barriers that, frankly, I have never been able to understand. I am really concerned that the will of the Government is lacking on this issue and that the legislation will stall further as birth parents die and adopted people age, so we will "age out" of this issue. From all the revelations of recent decades in respect of mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and other institutions, including adoption societies, we know there is a great deal of hidden information concerning adopted people's birth parents and families that rightfully belongs to those adopted people. By the way, I wish to stress to the Minister a point that relates to the scoping exercise and why I think many people have professed some unease about it. As the Minister knows, the commission on mother and baby homes does not include St. Patrick's Guild, it does not include the Rotunda Girls Aid Society and it does not include, I reckon, at least 30 or 40 other organisations, not to mention all the freelance nuns and priests who privately arranged adoptions. Just this morning, I sat with someone who was born in Holles Street and handed over to a loving adoptive family - no doubt about that - but as she traced her history, she discovered her adoption was not registered until years later, when the family was adopting another child. This is multilayered and multifaceted and really needs to move before, as I said, most of the people involved die. In the period from the introduction of adoption in the early 1950s up to the 1980s, when the number of adoptions decreased dramatically, more than 40,000 people were adopted. Most of these people are still alive; many of their parents are not. As the Minister herself has said, we are talking about up to 150,000 records or more if we go back to the foundation of the State. In one of the last denials of personal freedoms in Ireland, many adopted people are still locked out of access to their own files. It is difficult to understand this when we know that the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia for close to half a century have allowed access to information once an adopted person becomes an adult. This is one of the last veils of secrecy and it sometimes seems that adult adopted people will be the last people to get personal rights in this country. I said to the Minister yesterday, and I say it again today, that I can give an example of legislation which was worked on by all parties in this House, about which many people were concerned at the time and which was difficult to progress. I refer to the transgender legislation. We came back again and again to that legislation. I did so as Minister. People started off with very grave doubts, as many people have, though they will not say so now, about the right of adopted people to information. We worked that out, and the Minister herself was very involved in that debate. Will the Minister therefore take courage that she can actually do this? She is a member of a Government comprised almost entirely of Fine Gael Members. It is a fascinating insight to go back to the contributions of some Fine Gael Members to the debates on adoption and the fears of strangers walking onto big farms. They are in the records of the Library, though they may not be accessible at present. It is a compliment to the children, particularly boys, who were farmed out as labourers once they hit the age of 14 and the girls who went to work as maids and servants in doctors' practices and middle-class homes all over Ireland. It should be borne in mind as well that when families gave children up for adoption, the minimum fee for St. Patrick's Guild, from all the records I have seen and the personal stories I know, was £100 at the time of the Act for a baby plus £5 for clothes. With that, people who were often in desperate circumstances were given assurances that the baby would be well adopted. If I had an anthem for tracing on adoption, I would definitely use the Frances Black song "All the Lies That You Told Me" because that is what this is about. It is about secrets and lies, and we have not rooted them out yet. So many people who have been adopted have brothers and sisters from whom they were separated. I know myself from working with people on this issue that many people who ended up giving up children for adoption were in long-term relationships. That was not always acknowledged. In some cases these people went on to marry. The social mores and church mores of the time made them give up the first babies they had, and that baby then went on, hopefully, to be adopted by a good family. Pretty much anything was preferable to living one's life permanently in an institution. Of course, this was known very widely except to the adopted person. Very often the story gradually came out at family functions - weddings, funerals and suchlike - at which people said, "Do you not know you are adopted?" There was a kind of tap on the shoulder to tell the adopted person some particular feature of the adoption and of the family relations. The Minister needs to take her courage in her hands and talk to those other people in the Cabinet. We have gone through a full five years, since I was last in government, of talking about it.Deputy Enda Kenny proved persuadable that he should issue an apology to those who were in the Magdalen laundries. It is the Minister's job to persuade this Taoiseach that he should lift the veil of secrecy. He and others have benefited from our acknowledgement in full of other rights, but this Dáil still has not acknowledged the rights of adopted people to their personal histories and information.

I appreciate it. I am happy to make a few brief remarks on the issue of adoption. What has emerged in light of the illegalities and forced adoptions in this State is a scandal that cries to heaven for justice. The idea that young babies and children were forcibly removed from their parents without their consent is something that should cause the most serious and sustained reflection on our part. It is a betrayal of the ethos that I and many hundreds of thousands of others in this State believe which says that every human life is precious and of infinite value. It should never have happened regardless of the intention or the motivation. A mother’s love is something sacred and utterly unique. The bond between her and her baby is like nothing else in the natural world. We should have cherished that love. Instead we betrayed it and there is no hiding from that plain fact. I have listened to the stories of those who were caught up in the facts emerging about St Patrick’s Guild and in particular to one story of how a young mother came back to her room to find her baby had been removed. Who can imagine the terror and horror that that young woman experienced? How can I or any one of us speak to the pain of such a horrible event? We cannot. All we can do is walk with these people and offer them the kind of compassion and friendship that they ought to have received all those years ago. Yesterday, my staff and I attended the briefing which the Minister provided which was most informative and helpful and I thank him for that. As the Minister observed, recent events have utterly changed the legislative landscape in terms of how we approach this issue. There was a definite sense that what we want to achieve is the greatest possible outcome for those caught up in scandals like that of St Patrick’s Guild. It is an issue that I hope will rise above party squabbles and be treated with the kind of respect and dignity it deserves. I know there are issues relating to the adoption register in terms of data protection and so on, but those can be addressed in the fullness of time during the debates that will no doubt take place in this House when the adoption Bill comes before us. We must address the wounds of the past. We cannot ignore them but we must deal with them fairly. In the heat of debate, and I am sure the Minister will agree, we cannot lose sight of that fact that justice must be extended to all those religious who genuinely gave their lives and their love to the children in their care. While there are stories that horrify us, they are not the full picture. Not long ago, my office was contacted by the relative of two aunts who were nuns from the 1940s until very recently. They both gave their lives in establishing medical and orphanage care to thousands of young children in this State. For many years before they died, people would come to them and thank them for the only instances of human warmth they ever received. Their generosity of soul cannot be airbrushed out of history. Our top priority must be about establishing urgent redress for those caught up in the recent adoption scandal. As Deputy Clare Daly noted at yesterday's briefing, age is not on the side of many of those seeking justice and the truth about their children. Anything we can we do in terms of access to records must be done to help speed that process along. Archbishop’s House has indicated that it will assist in this matter, and that is to be greatly welcomed. Subjecting these people to trauma at the beginning of their lives was bad enough but to do it to them again at the end of their life would be unforgivable.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	195	We are discussing something that was an illegal practice. It is was the falsification of birth certificates. To my knowledge, only one person has ever been prosecuted for this crime in the history of the State, a woman named Mrs. Keating who ran an illegal adoption agency or racket from her private nursing home, St. Rita's, in Ranelagh. Her activities were first brought to the attention of the gardaí in 1954, yet she was not prosecuted until 1964, ten years later. She was sentenced to the probation Act. After her sentencing, a priest went to visit the then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, to plead her case so that she would not lose her nursing home licence. While he waited in the corridor to see the Taoiseach, he bumped into the Minister for Agriculture, Charles Haughey, who asked what his business was. When the priest told him, Haughey laughingly replied that "half the babies born in St. Rita's were fathered by members of the Dáil". As Mike Milotte, reporting this quote, observed in a recent article:A gross exaggeration, no doubt, but a timely reminder that for every crisis pregnancy there was a putative father in the wings, often men in positions of authority, employers, respectable members of society, other women’s husbands, priests even, and, yes, politicians – all of them equally protected from disclosure by the practice of falsifying birth records.Is it any wonder it has taken so long for the State to face up to the truth?It is a point well made. It is often suggested that this is something that was done as a favour to the woman or to the child, but the protection of men, including powerful and wealthy men, was also behind this particular racket. This debate is situated within a wider debate of church-State relations and the historical injustices to women. The recent referendum was passed by a landslide. People were repelled by the misogyny of the No side, but on top of misogyny there was also hypocrisy in that it could be seen that it was never a question of loving both but rather of loving neither when it came to women and their children born out of wedlock. This is another case which makes a powerful argument in favour of the separation of church and State. I think it was yesterday when I engaged with the Minister in the House on this issue. I asked her if this issue of hundreds, and potentially thousands, of illegal adoptions had been brought to the Department's attention in 2011 and again in 2013. I pointed out that the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, assured the Dáil that all adoptions in the State since 1952 had been in accordance with the law, namely, the Adoption Act 1952 and subsequent legislation. This position was restated, not once but twice, by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, when he took over the reins in the Department of Justice and Equality. That is false. It was not the case. The other day, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, told me there was not absolute proof in 2013. If the proof was not absolute, there were enough strong clues to warrant a full audit of all files in the State. That did not happen, however, and it is still not on the Minister's agenda. She spoke of a sample audit.I put it to the Minister that, on the grounds of the health of the people involved and their records alone, that is not sufficient. There needs to be a full audit backed up with the proper resources for Tusla in terms of money and manpower to make sure we get to the bottom of this for once and for all.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	There has to be a full audit because the State has failed potentially thousands of people whose identities and records were, in some cases, falsified. In other cases we do not know if they were. That can have very serious implications at so many different levels for the people affected in terms of their right to their identities, medical histories and heritages. There is simply no alternative but to give the full audit that has been requested by those who have been campaigning for many years to bring this issue properly into the light and to have a full audit of the files carried out. This scandal arises from the fact that the Catholic Church and religious bodies were given control over adoption services in this country and that control was exercised in a story of secrets, lies, cover-ups and, in many cases, almost certainly illegal activity. We have to get to the bottom of that. The saga has gone on for too long. The consequences for some can potentially be awful. It is not a story that is over. It is not past history for huge numbers of people but one that continues to work its way through their lives and existences now and which can have all sorts of implications. In my case, as one who was adopted during that period, having talked to both my birth family and my adoptive family, both insisted that things were done correctly at the time at both ends of the process. The adoption papers are therefore in order and the original names went on the birth certificate. What none of them know, however, is what happened in between. That is the point over which neither the biological family nor the adoptive family, which would have acted in good faith, had any control. They would have had no control over what the church and its institutions were doing in the middle of the process and what was motivating them. As Deputy Barry said, in many cases their motivations were to protect the identities of prominent people, to hide more generally the reality of Irish society and to provide cover for an atmosphere and regime which they created and generated which in many cases forced women who had children outside marriage to give those children up, either by generally creating an atmosphere or often by directly physically pulling children out of the hands of their mothers. In my case I was very lucky. I was adopted by a very loving family and was then lucky enough for my biological mother to also come and find me. I have two families, which is brilliant, but for many people the adoption may not have worked out so well. Perhaps they cannot find their biological families and they are blocked at every hand's turn. The absence of accurate records in many of those cases means that they may be frustrated and may never find out. There was absolute falsification in some cases. I am aware of some of those cases. There was absolutely blatant falsification to protect particular people. I do not believe there is any alternative but to have a full audit to do justice for those who are caught up in this crisis. The last point I make is that this is, yet again, a reminder of the urgency of separating out church and State in all sorts of services, whether adoption, the welfare of children in our schools, or our hospitals. What is at the centre of this? It is that religious morality trumped people's rights and that the institutions to which the State had outsourced these absolutely critical services, as it continues to do in the cases of health and education, believed that their particular morality was more important than the law and than the rights of individual human beings. That lesson has to be learned and that separation has to be achieved. That is not a statement against people's religious faith by the way. I want to stress that. It is not an attack on people's Catholicism or whatever. It is about saying that religion is a private matter and that those institutions should not have control over vital services and over the lives of individuals.

I understand from the person who works in my office that is not what is going out. The term "incorrect" is going out, but the title of the speech is "illegal birth registrations" and I welcome that. I also welcome the Minister's announcement on 29 May. That is the day on which my mother died many years ago. I cannot imagine coping with a false registration of the death or birth in addition to the grief. I will be coming back to that in a minute. Having looked at the documents St. Patrick's Guild had given her quite some time before, which is a point I will also come back to, the Minister announced on 29 May that there were 126 cases of illegal registration in the period between 1946 and 1969. Nobody was shocked by that. The shock came because it had taken so long. My additional shock came because she made that announcement through a press conference rather than coming into the Dáil, the democratic forum, and presenting her findings in context. I have a difficulty with that. I want to work with the Minister and believe in her bona fides. I would have been helped in that if she had come in and explained the situation to us. I understand that the documents from St. Patrick's Guild had been with Tusla since 2016. The Minister then made an announcement in 2018 without putting it in context to explain the delay. As I have done every time I have stood up on this subject, I will again quote from briefing papers that were given to the highest officials in the HSE with a note that said they should go all the way up to the Minister. In respect of the mother and baby home and Bessborough, and in the context of the Magdalene laundry, where information came up the people in charge said that it was beyond their scope. This is what they highlighted. In both of these cases, that is, in both mother and baby homes, of concern "were interference with birth and death certification which requires further investigation". This was written in October 2012 with a note to send it up to the Minister. This is as a result of the Martin McAleese report and his investigations. "Children, if not the mothers who passed though these systems are likely to still be alive and at the very least" this should be investigated. It goes on and on to say that this is a serious issue. In addition I will quote one more little thing from one of the notes on 12 October 2012. It is easy to remember the 12th of the month in the 12th year:This may prove to be a scandal that dwarfs other, more recent issues with the Church and State, because of the very emotive sensitivities around adoption of babies, with or without the will of the mother.A concern is that, if there is evidence of trafficking babies, that it must have been facilitated by doctors, social workers etc., and a number of these health professionals may still be working in the system.It is more important to send this up to the Minister as soon as possible: with a view to an Inter-Departmental Committee and a fully fledged, fully resourced forensic investigation and State Inquiry.That note is from 2012, this is 2018. It was six years ago so I hope the Minister will forgive me if I appear cynical. When one comes from a large family one inevitably encounters lots of problems and learns from them. I was not shocked by this nor were any of the other people I know. Indeed survivors have spoken about these illegal practices for years. Conall Ó Fátharta, who deserves an award, spoke about this back in 2010, eight years ago.He has written about it practically month after month since. The story has arisen time and again and successive Ministers have either failed or refused to act. I cannot count the number of Ministers involved. There were at least three, but a lot more since the 1950s. There is knowledge and evidence dating from as far back as the 1950s. In the 1990s, the national archivist, Catriona Crowe, revealed the extent of the problem and the fact that the Department responsible for external affairs had knowledge of the practice as early as the 1950s. Mike Milotte published his book Banished Babies way back in 1997, the year my second child was born. I am not sure whether the Minister read it. I understand it has been reissued lately. It added much to the detail of Catriona Crowe's discovery. Since 2010, the Irish Examiner journalist Conall Ó Fátharta has revealed time and again the practice of forced and illegal adoptions carried out by the State and religious and private institutions. Furthermore, I understand that another article by the journalist this week reveals that Tusla has now raised concerns about a further 748 adoption cases from St. Patrick's Guild alone. It is extraordinary that we have to rely on journalists for our information. There is evidence of names being changed, references to payments being made - often of £100 - the placement of children with no corresponding adoption orders and other irregularities. What precisely is the nature of those irregularities? Tusla has produced three interim reports. All preceded the announcement of 29 May. Where are they? Can we have sight of them? Can that be published? Why have they not been published? The third interim report was prepared on 10 May. It states that 611 children were identified as having been sent overseas and that a deeper review and analysis would be required to track the journey of each infant from birth to the point where he or she left the jurisdiction. I understand that Tusla revealed that, while dealing with tracing inequities since it took possession of St. Patrick's Guild's records in early 2016, it has discovered a significant number of suspected illegal registrations, dating as far back as June 2017. We know that the AAI informed the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2013 that St. Patrick's Guild was aware of several hundred illegal registrations. The response of the Department at the time was nothing short of insulting. It stated that an audit of adoption records was of limited benefit and would yield little useful information. Can one imagine that for a response? We know this problem goes well beyond St. Patrick's Guild. It is only one of an estimated 180 institutions that facilitated adoptions in this State. Theresa Hiney Tinggal was illegally adopted from an agency outside St. Patrick's Guild. She has been campaigning on this for ten years. Her feeling is that she has been absolutely ignored by three Ministers, whom she names. They were in power prior to the current Minister. Mr. Paul Redmond, the chairman of Adoption Rights Now, has said the practice in St. Patrick's Guild was far more widespread. Mr. Fergus Finlay stated on "Morning Ireland" recently that he believes every single agency in the State was involved in illegal adoptions. I hope I picked that up incorrectly because it is an extraordinary statement. I do not need to tell the Minister that everybody has a right to know his or her identity. We have an obligation to ensure people who want to know can find out where they come from. It has implications for everything, as the Minister knows. People far more articulate than I am have referred to this in respect of medical history and health implications. It is imperative that there be a full and thorough investigation of all files concerning St. Patrick's Guild and all adoption agencies. We have no choice. If the Minister wants to start a new role, this is the only way to do it. If she reads the briefing notes from 2012 and still sticks with the old ways, we will be lost. This is a golden opportunity to do it right. Having a targeted sampling exercise is just not good enough. This cannot be a game of chance for the people involved such that some will be lucky enough to be included while others will not. We must include all survivors in a full investigation. I welcome the Minister's commitment to pushing the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and ensuring it will pass through the Seanad as expeditiously as possible. I must state, however, that I have a fundamental difficulty with the undertaking that is being asked for. I cannot see myself voting for it, much as I would like to do so. It is huge. It is being stated that there will be no penalty if the undertaking is broken but that sums up Irish society. We make people give an undertaking but if they break it, which is only human, we do not penalise them, thus bringing the law into disrepute. The law has been brought into disrepute on every level. Laws have been ignored and broken and laws have been made up to suit the Church. I cannot tell the Minister what my personal and professional experience and my having the privilege of being a Deputy have done for me. Institutions do not change. They simply lie, cover up and hide unless leadership is shown from the outside and unless they are pushed to do what is required so we can learn. None of this was accidental. This was a deliberate State policy, by and large affecting poor families and poor children. This is the subject of another day's discussion. For today, I ask the Minister never again to make an announcement such as that made at the press conference. If she wants us to work with her, she should set out in the Dáil how the information came to her attention and the nature of the delay from 2016 onwards when she had the information and knew the implications. If she does this, I will happily work with her and she will restore my trust in the system, which is at an all-time low.

They help me and my officials as we continue to work on issues that have been of such profound significance to so many people for such a long time, as Deputy Connolly just indicated. I am aware of this and of the various circumstances and research findings the Deputy has just shared in the Chamber. They are exceedingly helpful and we are listening. We are attempting to offer a way for 2018 under my leadership. I will try to respond to the issues raised to the best of my ability. We will continue to come back to them, not least in the context of the Bill. Deputies Connolly, Boyd Barrett, Mitchell and others mentioned the investigation of other records and the specific further analysis I have asked for. I see that as a really important and sensible step in terms of the methodology of approaching the 100,000 files that are under the jurisdiction of the State. I have not said that is the end. I am very open to moving beyond that. We have tried to design the process in such a way that it will be relatively quick and so we will know that, after the first four months approximately, we will be in a better position to determine how we might move forward. Much of this concerns the issue of methodology, something of which, as a former researcher, I am aware. Officials are now identifying a methodology to ascertain whether they can consider some aspects of a huge number of files in the initial stage in order to determine whether something should be done next and, if so, what. From having listened to other stakeholders, in addition to Deputies here, I realise it may be recommended that we need to go further, in which case a methodology will be presented, but it strikes me that in order to move forward in this regard, we might also need to engage a wider group of stakeholders, particularly but not only inclusive of advocates, adoptees, archivists, relevant journalists - some of whom Deputy Connolly mentioned - and genealogy experts. Deputies have called for this. It may be that drawing on some the wider expertise, which seems to be what is needed, might help us to proceed more effectively than by using more traditional forms of research. I have received, as have other Deputies, a number of representations from people who believe they are illegally registered. Those are people who have come forward as distinct from us examining the 100,000 records we have, and they are being examined in a particular way as part of the research. Those are a few examples that might impact on the methodology in terms of moving forward. I do not want to pre-empt any decision that may be taken but from listening to what is being said on the airwaves, this is an issue that runs very deep across many thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people's lives. We have an obligation to find ways to ensure that we discover the evidence of illegal registrations to the best of our ability. That answers the question in terms of the initial investigative research. In terms of the records, and people have identified this also, we have 100,000 cases that are under the jurisdiction of the State. An estimated 50,000 records, although the figure is probably more than that, are not in the possession of the State such as those in adoption societies where records have not yet transferred to either Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI. I refer to PACT, Cunamh, St. Brigid's Adoption Agency, nursing homes, health professionals and private individuals. There are many more records that are not in our possession to allow us do something about it. As Deputies are aware, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill would provide a statutory basis to acquire those transfers but there may be other ways to do that. I understand the urgency expressed by the Deputies about this issue. As Deputy Mitchell said, these things are going on. I could voluntarily request the transfer of records but there are potential difficulties with that. It may not be clear who has what records. A voluntary request could be ignored or complied with in part only. The holders may cite data protection issues. I am not saying that will not happen but there are difficulties with that also. Deputy Rabbitte referred to capacity, particularly within Tusla, and conducting further research. The Deputy is right to raise that matte. In order to conduct further research and to underpin the information and tracing service, additional capacity will be required in order to eradicate waiting times for people - apart from the 126 or the others who are now suspect - and deal with the increased numbers that will come forward in light of the changing context. I am aware of that capacity issue. It is about money, but it is also about people. We need to find a solution urgently to that issue. Deputy Burton said that we do not want to age out this issue. I agree with her. That is why I am trying to initiate and lead a way forward to ensure there is a deeper sense of urgency in light of what we have found in that high bar of evidence. She said that people have a right to their personal history, which is a very helpful way of expressing it, as well as a right to information and tracing. Members referred to the fact that 740 other cases were identified by Tusla, and they may be added to the list. My understanding is that was part of the number it started with but it sifted through those and did the cross-referencing with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the General Register Office, GRO. Some of those dropped out in terms of coming to a higher level of certainty in terms of evidence of illegal adoptions because, as the Deputies are aware, when we have that number of cases, we need first to move towards contacting the people. The State requires a high level of certainty, higher than would be required in terms of making those kinds of approaches. It is different if people are coming towards us or indicating that they would like us to investigate something. In terms of the Bill, Sinn Féin Members believe that people ought to have a right and unfettered access to information. Deputy Burton and others are probably in agreement with that. I mentioned meeting Deputies and Senators yesterday with my officials. I would wish to pursue that in the context of the Bill. I want to push the boundaries as far as we can in terms what is constitutionally permissible but we hear what they are saying. As I said, we are operating in a changed context and I hope that gives us more possibility. I have not covered all the questions but we will have other opportunities to discuss them. In terms of the number of actions that need to happen, I wonder if it is time to consider a process of telling and hearing the truth about the way women and children were historically mistreated in Ireland and expanding and correcting our national record of the development of the State and our treatment of one another in it. There is a social history model coming from the mother and baby homes commission. That will be helpful in that regard but I refer again to a mode of transitional justice. Moving from a legacy of human rights abuses requires us to acknowledge, record, accept and apologise for those abuses and our collective responsibility for them. It is a process that perhaps could be survivor centred and designed with the needs and the hopes of survivors in mind. It may be time to consider a scope. We are living in a present that is still attempting to respond appropriately to the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes and the adoption illegality issues. We may need to reckon with our national history of gender and justice, inclusive of the ways in which it has impacted on boys. I take Deputy Martin Kenny's comments about home boys as well as men. These are other issues I will be considering as we move forward.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the Portiuncula University Hospital Health Service Executive, HSE, review of the maternity services and of a known number of adverse events between 2008 and November 2014, also known as the Walker report. I would like to begin by expressing my deepest sympathies to the families involved and welcome the completion of this review for them. I also thank them for their engagement in the review process, which was so important. The review was carried out by an external clinical review team led by Professor Walker. The learning from this review will help with the development and delivery of maternity services in the future. The Walker report has two parts. First, it provides a review of the maternity service provided by Portiuncula University Hospital, which is part of the Saolta University Health Care Group. Second, it reviews the care 18 babies and their mothers received and presents the overall findings from across these cases. I wish to recall what happened in Portiuncula University Hospital, how the issues came to light and how my Department and the HSE responded. Portiuncula University Hospital provides maternity services alongside general hospital services. It is a model 3 hospital providing 24-7 acute surgery, acute medicine, critical care, emergency department and maternity services. In 2017, there were 1,668 births. The maternity department comprises 33 beds and four delivery suites. In 2014, six babies were referred from the hospital for therapeutic hypothermia, also known as head cooling. This is used to try to reduce adverse effects from a lack of oxygen to a baby’s brain at the time of delivery. The hospital considered that six babies being referred for head cooling was higher than expected and, in November 2014, a preliminary review of these cases was undertaken by the hospital. This preliminary review found a cause for concern in the management of labour in some cases. As an immediate action, Portiuncula University Hospital agreed, and put in place, corrective actions and protective measures, including a process for the ongoing monitoring of all deliveries. The hospital undertook an audit the following month, in December 2014. This was to assess whether the recent changes were effective. The audit confirmed that all protective measures had been fully implemented and provided assurance that the services in place were safe. Following the preliminary review, an external review was commissioned by the Saolta University Health Care Group in February 2015. The purpose of the review was to provide a general review on maternity services and to consider the care provided in the individual cases. The external review team was set up to operate to a number of terms of reference. These terms provided for a review of the maternity services in general and a review of the individual cases. In early 2015, an expert review team of seven members was established. This was chaired by Professor James Walker, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology from the University of Leeds. The membership comprised two obstetricians, two midwives, two neonatologists and a patient advocate. At the commencement of the review the external team established a patient helpline for families who may have had concerns about their care. As a result of this, an additional 12 cases involving ten families were identified. In addition to the six babies covered by the preliminary review, the final external review covers the care provided to 18 babies and 16 families. I am assured that throughout the review process the HSE communicated with and met families and offered any services that they required to support them in dealing with the issues that arose. The review commenced in April 2015 and each case had an individual systems analysis conducted to identify the care received. These individual reports were provided to the families in April 2017. I turn to the report's findings. I wish to extend my sincere sympathies and thoughts again to the families impacted. I thank them sincerely for coming forward, sharing their experiences and inputting to the review. By outlining those experiences, bringing their stories forward and demanding change, they have helped us to try to improve our maternity services, leading to the improvements that have been put in place. The clinical review team found that of the 18 cases reviewed, serious errors in management occurred in ten. The team considered that if those errors had not occurred, there would probably have been different outcomes for those babies. To recognise the trauma and hurt for the families, I will record for the Dáil the outcome for the babies involved. There were three stillbirths, three baby deaths, two babies with developmental delays, four babies who have ongoing issues and six babies who are considered to be doing well. We cannot underestimate the extent of the impact of these events on the families, relatives and communities involved. It is important that the learning from the report and the experiences of these families should be a driver for change across all our maternity services in order that we can improve the experience of women and families as we go forward with our maternity services. To distil the learning, the report identifies a number of causal and contributory factors which affected the care received. The findings encompass a number of key areas, including lack of appropriate staffing, training across the multidisciplinary team, provision of clinical care, slow recognition of maternity incidents, communications with families, lack of open disclosure and lack of bereavement supports. Important recommendations were made and I will outline some of them to the House. There were 35 key recommendations in total and the HSE has been asked to address them as a matter of priority. The recommendations include changes related to the care environment, training, provision of clinical care, staffing and improvements needed to deal with communication. The report outlines the need for the maternity services to respond to increasingly diverse and complex population needs to provide safe, evidence-based, accessible care to all women, babies and their families. It also highlights the need for maternity networks supported by effective leadership, management and governance arrangements. These are recommended to share expertise across maternity services. Data collection and use of information to detect patterns and ensure ongoing review of care provided are highlighted. Recommendations are made on the changes to how maternity services are staffed, the skill mix used and priority areas for training in order that maternity services can respond to increasingly diverse and complex population needs to provide safe, evidence-based, accessible care to all women, babies and their families. We clearly need action on foot of this review. I have been advised that Portiuncula University Hospital has an implementation team in place to progress the recommendations and that most of the actions have been implemented. I thank the local team that has been working on this. Local Deputies will be aware of the work that has been ongoing to ensure the recommendations are implemented. Some of the key changes at the hospital include additional staff and a number of senior appointments. A director and assistant director of midwifery were appointed in 2016 and the number of consultants has increased to five from three. In addition, I am advised that training on open disclosure, CTG reading and relevant clinical issues has taken place in the hospital. I particularly welcome the fact that the implementation team includes input from some of the families affected. The implementation team must involve the families to drive the changes. That is important to ensure the findings of the review translate into meaningful improvements in care as experienced by the patients in the service. Finally, I refer to the ongoing work being undertaken at national level to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality maternity service. Ireland's first national maternity strategy was published in 2016. It is incredible we did not have such a strategy until 2016. That probably gives us an insight into how maternity services were, perhaps, the Cinderella of our heath service. I am pleased that the previous Government delivered the first strategy. It is important and it enjoys widespread support across the House. However, it is no good having a strategy if there is no forum in which to implement it. The HSE national women and infants health programme was established in 2017. The programme is entirely dedicated to women and infant health care, delivering the national maternity strategy and driving improvements in maternity services nationally. The programme has published its implementation plan and is currently overseeing the establishment of maternity networks, an issue that arises in the Walker report, in all hospital groups. Lessons have been learned from a difficult period in our maternity services, and the lessons that need to be learned have been identified. A number of changes have taken place in Portiuncula University Hospital, as I outlined earlier, but clearly the lessons from there must also be learned at national level. It must be about delivering the national maternity strategy and applying the lessons across the health service in terms of staffing levels, training for staff and the development of the maternity networks. Today's debate is a timely opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made to date and to note the further steps that must be taken.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I wish to extend our thoughts to the mothers, fathers and babies at the centre of the Portiuncula University Hospital report. What the report highlights is truly outrageous and scandalous. The report on maternity services at Portiuncula University Hospital was released approximately two months ago. It did not get much attention because we were in the middle of the CervicalCheck scandal and a campaign to repeal the eighth amendment. The report lays out a scandalous series of failures in respect of mothers, fathers and babies by the State. The bitter irony is that the report on this scandal relating to women's reproductive health did not get much attention when it emerged because we were preoccupied with two other issues relating to women's reproductive health. By and large, we have great maternity care in Ireland. We have one of the lowest maternal death rates in the world thanks to the fantastic work every day of our doctors, nurses, midwives and everyone else involved. When it comes to women’s health and the control of women’s bodies, however, this State has a dark past - the Magdalen laundries, mother and baby homes, symphysiotomy, forced adoptions and falsified birth certificates. The list goes on and on. Now added to that list is what happened at Portiuncula hospital between 2008 and 2014 and who knows when else at that hospital. A total of 18 births were examined. Six involved either stillbirths or the death of the baby shortly after delivery. Six of the babies who survived suffered injuries leading to lifelong disabilities. A litany of errors led to the serious harm and deaths of those babies. The report found that in ten of the 18 cases there was a relationship between errors made and the outcomes for the health and lives of those children. What happened? The report found there were insufficient resources, insufficient weekend cover, with sometimes no obstetrician and no midwife at the weekends and out of hours - so who was delivering the babies? -insufficient leadership, insufficient management and quality control, the wrong staff at the wrong times, the wrong training, the wrong qualifications and the wrong layout of the hospital. The list goes on. The report concludes that all of these errors combined to lead to the serious harm and death of babies. That serious harm was preventable. Sadly and soberly, those deaths were also preventable. After all of this came the failure to investigate; the failure to tell parents that mistakes were made; the failure to tell parents about coroner reports and investigations; the failure to tell parents that a review was even taking place; the failure to inform the Minister for Health; and the repeated failure to apologise. RTE’s "RTÉ Investigates" told the story of just one such family, whose two baby girls died in Portiuncula hospital. A review of one of the deaths took place in 2011. The parents were never told about the review, nor were they included in it. They found out about the review on television years later. When they found out, they applied for information under data protection legislation and what they discovered was damning. It included, for example, one email from a person at the hospital saying: “Obviously, I am concerned that the coroner’s directive to carry out a review will be discoverable.” That is a cover up. That is what happened. In 17 of the 18 cases the report found a lack of disclosure. We welcome the recommendations and we welcome the Minister's list of things that have improved, but it is not enough. I am asking the Minister to come back with a comprehensive document listing every recommendation in this report and stating what has happened to date, which recommendations have or have not been completed and a timeline for when that will happen.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	201	I will share the rest of the time with Deputy Rabbitte. I thank both Deputy Donnelly and Deputy Rabbitte for sharing time with me. A shocking litany of failures and errors is outlined in this long-awaited report of an independent review of maternity services at Portiuncula hospital in County Galway. Of the 18 maternity cases which were reviewed, six babies died and in ten cases there were there serious errors of management that would probably have made a difference to the outcome for babies. As Deputy Donnelly said, it is important that we remember this evening the babies who died and their families, and acknowledge the horrific heartbreak and trauma which the families have endured and no doubt are still suffering as they come to terms with such huge loss. The report highlights a number of key issues relating to the service provided in Portiuncula hospital between 2008 and 2014. These include delays in escalation of concerns to more senior decision-makers, deficits in both medical and nursing staff numbers, poor CTG trace interpretation, and concerns relating to the administration of oxytocin during labour. The report raised concerns over the communication with families during and after their time in hospital. The report also highlighted historical issues relating to the governance structures in place between the hospital and the group at that time. The report made 154 recommendations under five headings. I know the Minister said that most of those had been put in place, but I would like him to inform us as quickly as possible which have not been implemented yet. These families have suffered the greatest of all losses, the loss of a child. That serious errors of management would probably have made a difference to the outcome for some babies in some cases compounds the tragedy. While nothing can ever compensate for the loss of a child, the State has an obligation to these families to ensure that all of the key recommendations on maternity services at Portiuncula hospital are implemented to ensure that no other mother or father has to suffer the same heartbreak. That is the very least we owe them.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	202	I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me. I had my baby in 2005 and was fortunate. I gave birth in Portiuncula hospital and had a very good experience. It is important to put that on the record at the outset. I attended the briefing session in Ballinasloe on the night it was announced. Maybe I am cynical, but the strategic release with only 24 hours' notice to coincide with the CervicalCheck scandal meant minimal media coverage and that it flew under the radar. It was a cynical move by HSE at a time when people were at saturation point when it comes to national scandals and the failings of our health system. It is another shocking example of the failings of HSE when it comes to perinatal care and health of Irish women. The key findings from the investigation of 18 cases that occurred from 2008 to 2014 were as follows. Sixteen families have suffered greatly, including one family that lost two babies. Six babies have died. Of the 18 cases examined, serious errors occurred in ten cases which would probably have made a difference for the babies involved. The lengthy report included more than 150 recommendations - too many to mention here. Not least was the lack of clinical governance and proper incident management. The main issues were problems in clinical care and problems with communication after delivery. For most people attending hospital, clinical care was adequate provided nothing went wrong. This is setting the bar far too low, hoping that everything will be all right because if it is not, who knows what could happen. Inadequacies were found in staff ability to interpret abnormal test results and to respond appropriately, escalate care level when needed, make timely clinical decisions, and communicate effectively among themselves about women and babies in their care. Surely these are basic skills. The lack of communication among medical and nursing staff on the ground is indicative of a hierarchical structure in which those higher up cannot be questioned. It is frightening that problems with staff communication after delivery are similar to problems with CervicalCheck. Information was not given to women and their partners in an appropriate or timely way. It is clear that this is not a one-off for the HSE but rather something that happens routinely. In only 20% of cases was communication to parents about what had happened to their baby deemed satisfactory. Most women felt that they were not listened to before or during labour, that their concerns were dismissed by staff, and that no one explained how unwell their babies were and why. There was no chance to debrief about what had happened. Women did not understand why particular tests and procedures were being carried out. If people do not understand what tests are about, how can they give informed consent? Technically, to proceed without consent is a criminal offence. It was generally felt that there was a lack of openness. This seems to be a common theme across HSE with no open disclosure and no informed consent. How much hurt could have been avoided by open communication? What else are we not being told? Many of the key recommendations are basics and would be standard practice, including clinical handover, staffing ratios, proper induction of new staff, appropriate leadership, the presence of senior staff on wards, and following best practice guidelines. I know I am out of time, but on the night of the presentation, I was there flicking through the report, as anyone else would do. What stood out for me was the lack of appropriate midwifery-led care either in the clinics or on the labour ward. In two cases when appointing the senior midwifery staff member, she was not qualified as a midwife. That is unbelievable in a maternity hospital. Pat Nash described the situation in Ballinasloe that evening.Nurses were not talking to each other, the level of communication was bad and personal issues were getting in the way and affecting how decisions were being made.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	I offer my sympathies to all those women and families affected by the serious and scandalous errors which occurred at Portiuncula University Hospital and resulted in their babies dying or being left with life-changing injuries and disabilities. I thank Professor James Walker who led the expert review team and authored this report. While the report into what happened in the care of these 18 babies was much needed, it is a shame that such errors and poor care occurred in the first instance. As in the case of the report into baby deaths at Portlaoise hospital, this report highlights huge failures, some of which continue to exist in our health service. Historically, maternity care has often been underfunded, subject to poor medical practices and has been investigated continually as a result of neonatal and maternal deaths and injury. Reports such as this report into Portiuncula hospital do not exist in isolation. They follow a pattern of poor care for women and infants in this State. It is not lost on the women of this State that not only do they receive inadequate maternity care, but even where care is given, there are significant problems due to understaffing, poor practices, inadequate equipment and a health service that is not sensitive to, and does not reflect, gender differences. In other hospitals, a 20-week scan is not standard procedure. This is a huge problem across many of our maternity hospitals. The report criticises the hospital for poor communication among maternity staff and a lack of skills and training to deal with emergency cases. It found that there was a general lack of skills and training among front-line staff and a lack of obstetric consultant supervision in the labour ward. It also found that consultants appeared to wait to be called and did not take ownership of the clinical care being given, and this resulted in an inappropriate handover of care. The report also found that care when things were progressing normally appeared to be of a high standard but the response to a deteriorating situation was often slow and deficient. This appears to a trend across many of our maternity hospitals and general health services. When one delves into the report and reads the testimony of those interviewed, one gets a feel for a hospital that was being neglected by management and plagued by difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. During interviews, the obstetric consultants at Portiuncula hospital expressed to the critical review team their concern that the level of training and experience of some of the non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, was not of a standard previously seen and that this was significantly compounded by the fact that there was an unfilled registrar training post in Portiuncula University Hospital, PUH, and that junior grades were often filled by locum doctors to cover registrar positions. Yesterday, Sinn Féin received a response to a parliamentary question from the HSE, showing that Portiuncula hospital spent €5.6 million on agency staff in 2017. This is reflective of a crisis in recruiting and retaining staff. The result of the above problems at PUH was that doctors came with different levels of knowledge and varied knowledge of the Irish maternity system. The clinical review team, CRT, was also informed that there were no formal clinical assessments of new appointees and no increase in supervision by consultants as there were only three consultants to run the service. The CRT heard a lot of concerns from the midwifery staff, who felt generally unsupported and that the midwifery management structure was fragmented. The midwifery lines of responsibility were very convoluted and midwifery staff levels were deficient, with a lack of consistent CMM cover in the labour ward. Midwives had requested more staff as early as 2013. As a result of these staffing deficits, there was a lack of support for junior midwives, and midwives said they sometimes found it difficult to escalate to an obstetric consultant. The report found that in many instances systems failures, staff deficiencies, poor practices, a lack of training and skills among staff, particularly agency staff, and poor management and oversight played a significant role in the errors that occurred, which resulted in baby deaths or babies being left with life-changing injuries and disabilities. Such failings go to the heart of the problems and crises affecting the health service. Among the issues highlighted in this report are a recruitment and retention crisis, an underfunding of our maternity services, an over-reliance on agency staff, and a lack of appetite to implement the national maternity strategy and bring Ireland into line with Birthrate Plus standards and so on. Another issue pointed to in the report was a lack of open disclosure of information to the family, an issue arising in so many other areas of our health services, as dealt with in this House in recent days. Even when information was provided, some of it was withheld and families told the CRT said that they only received information regarding events during delivery a significant time after the baby's birth, often weeks, months or years later. The CRT acknowledged that it is incredibly frustrating for families not to get important information about their cases in an open, transparent and timely manner. Time and again, such issues have arisen in our health service, including in the recent CervicalCheck scandal. My colleague, Deputy Louise O’Reilly, who cannot be here due to an engagement with survivors of the transvaginal mesh scandal, introduced a Bill earlier today to make open disclosure mandatory, not voluntary. This is a critical issue. The problems and hurt a lack of open disclosure have caused to the women and families affected cannot be overstated. The recommendations contained in this report and the national maternity strategy must be implemented as a matter of urgency. If these recommendations are not implemented and if the individuals and agencies do not take responsibility for what happened, these scandals will continue. There should automatically be an inquest into every maternal death, neonatal death or death of a baby during delivery. Deputy Clare Daly’s Coroners Bill provides for automatic inquests in all cases of maternal deaths in our hospitals. The Government refuses to progress this Bill. We need to see such legislation enacted as a matter of urgency. I again offer my sympathy and the sympathy of Sinn Féin to the women, families and babies affected by this scandal.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	204	I welcome the publication of the clinical review of the maternity services as Portiuncula hospital and this opportunity to discuss its findings. I commend the families who came forward, some of whom I know and have met. They are very brave. They are not happy with this report and they propose to continue the fight because they do not believe it goes far enough in terms of addressing the appalling experiences many of them had at the hospital. Like everyone else, I extend my sympathies to the families and extended families affected by this scandal. Following on from this report, lessons must be learned. This report is a damning indictment of the manner in which we have treated women in this country. Publication of this report went below the radar because of the time at which it was published. I share Deputies' concerns in this regard. This report was long delayed. I met the families who told me they had seen the preliminary version, and although they were not happy with it, they knew it was ready to be published. This report was published at the time of the referendum and the CervicalCheck scandal, so it did not get the attention it deserved. The Minister might want to explain why that happened because people are coming up with their own answers as to why it happened. I have spoken to the families affected and they are not happy with some of the report, though they accept other parts of it. No amount of apologies from the Saolta University Health Care Group will be of any comfort to them because the State let them down. It let down people who are very vulnerable and who suffered. One of the families, which I will call "D and C" and with whom I have had communications on a number of occasions, feels the review was inefficient. They said they would like to highlight the lack of efficiency in the review, question the method and independence of it and question the group, particularly as much of what was going on at times reached the media before it reached them. The report was due originally in the summer of 2015 and has taken almost three and a half years to complete. This has added enormous suffering to an already traumatic experience and it is unacceptable. The hospital group had many questions to answer in the time leading up to the report being compiled. At the time, however, it seemed more concerned about its public relations profile than the families at the centre of this, something which, I contend, mirrors what is happening with CervicalCheck at present. A lengthy list of the failures in the delivery of maternity services at PUH has been published. It makes for quite difficult reading. Serious errors of management occurred in ten cases that would have led to different outcomes. There was a lack of management, and the process relating thereto, and leadership. In 2014, six babies were referred from the hospital for therapeutic hypothermia, which was considered a higher figure than average at the time. Therapeutic hypothermia, or targeted temperature management, TTM, is a treatment whereby body temperature is maintained at a specific level in order to improve outcomes following a period of reduced or stopped blood flow to the brain. Following this, there were an additional 12 cases and we know what happened as a result. The report represents a catastrophic failing and falls in line with other failures. I have a very important question for the Minister. The review has a specific timeframe but these issues did not appear out of nowhere. I know people who believe that there are issues in this hospital dating from before this timeframe which need to be reviewed. Will they be considered? I will focus on a number of key points in what is a very detailed report. The clinical review team noted that a shortage in staff numbers, limited access to training and limited availability of resources impacted upon the ability of PUH to keep up to date with some of the latest developments in skills and techniques in clinical care. The clinical review team also noted, from interviews relating to the 18 system analysis investigations, SAIs, and PUH training records, that the experience, level of ability and training of some obstetric non-consultant hospital doctors was not at a level previously experienced, requiring greater senior support. We are acutely aware of the ongoing crisis management in respect of staffing at the hospital and across Ireland. We discussed this recently in the context of the number not on the specialist register who have been appointed to consultant posts. What happened in the case of Portiuncula also happened in the past, which shows where we are heading in respect of problems in the future. Such problems will be on a mass scale across many disciplines. If we are appointing people who are not qualified to take up roles and who do not have the experience, training or knowledge of dealing with cases, we all know where that will lead, not just in obstetrics but also in other areas. The report is shocking and deeply worrying. Given that the hospital was aware of its shortage of staff, it is baffling that there was no autonomous midwifery to take on low-risk care independently. This could have taken the form of clinics, led by midwives, in intrapartum care in order to allow doctors to focus on cases where there was significant medical need. There was also a clear breakdown in organisational terms. It is nothing new to us to hear of the HSE breaking down in organisational terms. In 2008, the hospital was a stand-alone operation under the umbrella of HSE west and then became part of the group it is in now. The review is very critical of this, stating:... senior staff at PUH did not feel involved and believed that they no longer had ownership of their environment. It is the view of the CRT that this may have contributed to PUH being less able to respond to the problems that arose at a local level. At the time of the 2014 cases, incidents were reported onto Q-Pulse initially by PUH staff. Preliminary Assessment Reports (“PAR”) were completed by PUH and forwarded to the Serious Incident Management Team “SIMT” meeting. There was no further action after the escalation of the first two casesWhy was this? It was because the structures of the HSE did not allow it and there was nowhere to go. This represents the complete systemic failure of an organisation. It is extremely difficult to read all the clinical issues identified in the report. I welcome a number of recommendations relating to the care environment, training, clinical care, staffing improvements, the need for effective leadership, change in governance arrangements and data collection. We all know that open disclosure did not happen but there have been key changes, with additional staff in the form of a director and assistant director of midwifery and an increase in the number of consultants to five. However, we need to ensure that this report is implemented. We also need to ensure that, where there are other cases, they will be dealt with independently. We also need to learn from this on a number of fronts. We have a national maternity strategy which, even as Opposition spokesman, I would say is brilliant but it is not being funded. A new hospital is required in Limerick but it cannot even get a couple of million euro for it to start. There are issues over neonatal brain injury rates. Are voluntary hospitals sharing their neonatal brain injury data with the HSE? Are there any outliers that we need to be concerned about? Evidence which has been sent to me suggests that there may be. Is there any resistance to data-sharing in this area? Does the national women and infants health programme have sufficient authority to oversee outcomes on behalf of the Department of Health? Are voluntary hospitals dealing with outcomes appropriately? It would be wrong not to mention the correlation between the recommendations in this report and the Bill I introduced in the House yesterday. The Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2018 is a critical small piece of legislation based on the death of Conor Underwood, the son of Derek and Mignon Underwood, in Wexford General Hospital. Where a stillborn birth occurs, there is not the capacity for the family involved to seek redress. This is an anomaly and, in the context of the issues identified in this hospital, I ask the Minister to co-operate with the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure that it can be speedily added to another Bill.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	205	First, I thank the families affected who came forward with their concerns about maternity hospital services at PUH. I express to them the condolences of the Solidarity-People Before Profit group. The manner in which this State has treated women and children has been both a recurring theme and a major issue for Irish society. Indeed, the recent referendum was part of the overall debate within society about these matters. The neglect of women and children in the 20th century is becoming better known.The House has just discussed the situation facing those who were adopted and whose births were registered illegally. This State has a shameful record when it comes to mother and baby homes and industrial schools. The matter we are discussing, however, relates to maternity services in this century, not the distant past. There are people in this House who have been members of Cabinet at various points during the period in question. The recurring theme of neglect of pregnant women and children has continued into this century. The review identified 18 cases between 2008 and 2014. A number of children died and those that did not die suffered serious conditions such as brain damage and cerebral palsy. The children and their parents are facing that situation. Births, of course, are not without risk. However, this report identifies factors in these cases that could have been avoided. Proper practice and resources would have avoided the negative outcomes. The report identifies that different management of obstetric care would have resulted in better outcomes for the children in ten of the 18 cases involved. The report is clear about the issues at Portiuncula. There were clear failings in the escalation of concerns. Staff numbers were not sufficient to meet the needs of mothers and children. There was a clear lack of staffing at weekends and out of hours. The relevant consultant or midwife was not on duty on several occasions. There were also issues with training and practices when there were difficult births. The lack of use of oxytocin is mentioned as well.  Families were not openly communicated with and this intensified their grief. There are two examples of bereaved parents being contacted about their children by staff members at the hospital who were not aware that those children had died. This did not happen in the distant past, it was the practice here recently. What was the Ireland of 2008 to 2014 like? It was the era of austerity. Public services were cut back massively. Political decisions were made to prioritise the bank bailout and to make workers and public services pay for that bailout. We had severe reductions in public services, including the health service. Those in government at the time were austerity Ministers. Budgets were slashed and burned. Political decisions have a real effect when they reduce budgets. We have a ballooning waiting list in our public health service, with hundreds of thousands of people awaiting various procedures. Cuts to public spending mean fewer staff in our hospitals at times when they are needed. Anyone visiting a hospital knows the dedication and professionalism of healthcare workers. What happened at Portiuncula was that there was a lack of training, resources and staff to serve the needs of women and newborn children.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	206	The release of this report came at the height of the CervicalCheck scandal and it landed with less impact than it deserved. The CervicalCheck scandal hit the headlines. It was, unfortunately, an opportunity for some politicians, who may have been asleep at the wheel regarding this issue for the past ten years, to get a few headlines for themselves by shouting and roaring. They woke up and realised that there are deep-seated problems in the HSE with respect to owning up to and learning from mistakes. It is unfortunate that the news cycle can only fit in one scandal at a time. Perhaps we can learn from that. It is important that we talk about the import of the Portiuncula report. I am sick of talking about the catastrophic failures in our maternity services. I refer to the failure to admit mistakes which gives rise to the failure to learn from them. That leads to catastrophic harm to women and their babies followed by delay, cover-up, denial and the whole brutal cycle starting all over again. More than anything else, that is what strikes me about this report. The report was released three years late. It was so late that Warren and Lorraine Reilly, the parents of two of the babies that died in Portiuncula, Asha in 2008 and Amber in 2010, initiated legal proceedings because of the delay. We should say that Mr. Warren Reilly said he and his wife had never intended taking legal action. They thought that the review, which started in January 2015, would give them the answers they sought. It was, however, repeatedly delayed. They had no option but to take on a solicitor to try to get the answers that they desperately wanted and deserved. This is what happens in so many cases. People want answers; that is all they want. They are forced into court when they find the door slammed in their faces and then experience all of the trauma, stress and expense involved in getting those answers. It is wholly unacceptable and we, as a society, have to address it. There is no doubt that serious failures are outlined in the Portiuncula report. Those failures led to or contributed to the deaths of six babies and injuries to six others. These major failures, which obviously had catastrophic outcomes for the babies, the women and for the families, should not come as a surprise to anyone. Although we constantly hear about the excellent quality of our maternity services, the sad fact is that there were 31 inquests into baby deaths in the Republic of Ireland in the ten years between 2007 and 2017. In June 2016, the investigation of baby deaths at Portiuncula hospital was only one of many. Of our 19 maternity units, seven at that time were either under independent investigation or involved in inquests. That is a shocking statistic. The story of Portiuncula is the same as it has been everywhere else for the families involved. In addition to their dreadful sense of loss, they have had to cope with the overwhelming stress of trying to get answers from frightened hospital staff and an intransigent HSE. I will give one example. The inquest relating to baby Amber Reilly, who died in 2010, was held in 2011. The Dublin coroner, Dr. Brian Farrell, wrote to Portiuncula hospital asking for a full review of its maternity services to be carried out. In early 2015, Amber's father, Warren, said that the family had never been contacted about the review and had no idea if it ever happened. That is unbelievable. In February 2015, the Saolta University Health Care Group announced a review following the deaths of two other babies. It said that the review would cover a nine-month period in 2014. The Reillys only learned of this review via the radio. They realised at once that it was not going to cover the deaths of their two babies, Asha and Amber, both of whom died in Portiuncula. The Reillys were like so many families in this State. Mark and Roísín Molloy are struggling to get the truth about the death of their baby, Mark, in the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise. The Reillys had to go public before the cases of their babies were taken into account. How utterly shocking is that? They only learned in 2015 - after the second review was announced - that a review of Amber's death had actually taken place in 2011 and that recommendations had been made. Even worse, those recommendations had not been followed through at that time. That is appalling. After the 2011 review was completed, a doctor at Portiuncula hospital wrote to the State Claims Agency about sending a copy of the review to the Reillys. He wrote that he did not see any place in the correspondence with the coroner where a copy of the report was required to be given to the parents of a deceased baby.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	207	Two minutes is very little time within which to convey to the public the situation surrounding the application by the Muojeke family. The Minister is well aware of the case, based on my own representations and those of my constituency colleagues, Deputies Corcoran Kennedy and Nolan. He is aware that the initial application for refuge or asylum by Ms Muojeke was made in 2006 and 2007, for herself and her two children, Nonso and Victor. Following a refusal in 2009 based on legal advice, in 2016 the applicant made an application to the courts to revoke that appeal, which was dismissed by the High Court in recent weeks. Despite the merits or otherwise of the application, I wish to inform the Minister that the children of Ms Muojeke have excelled, thankfully, in the meantime, against all the odds. They have flourished in their schools, in their community and in our country. The petition handed to the Minister today and which was made available to other Members of the Dáil shows that over 20,000 people support this family's case, and support the contention that they are excelling. Victor, the older boy, is now on a scholarship at the University of Limerick. Nonso is at Tullamore College and is an integral part of that community and that education system. They are as Irish, I believe, as the Minister or myself. They have not been a financial burden on the State, and will not be going forward.  When one re-enters the country after having been abroad, as we all have done, it is gratifying to hear an official from the Department of Justice and Equality welcome us home. There is a great sense of pride in that, and a sense of comfort in that welcome, and an association with community attached to that. These children will never witness that if the Minister does not show the leniency it is within his power to show in this case. The Minister saw the petrified looks on the faces of these children and their mother when he met them briefly today. They believe themselves to be in a perilous situation, despite the effort and good will of everyone concerned, including school staff and students and the wider community in Tullamore.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, acknowledged the new compassion that exists in this country - which thankfully has no boundaries - in response to the recent referendum. He said that those women who had previously taken the boat and the plane would now be offered the hand of the State. The Minister for Justice and Equality now has an opportunity, between the application to the High Court and any subsequent application to the Supreme Court, to show compassion, based on humanitarian grounds. Irrespective of the negligence or otherwise of the State in dealing with the case over a period of time, the State must recognise the capacity for these children to excel and acknowledge the sense of welcome that these children experienced and which should not be forgotten.  I implore the Minister, in the short amount of time I have, to use the discretion available to him in this exceptional case. I am not disregarding the processes or the legislation associated with applications for refuge or asylum. As a Member of the Legislature I stand over those processes. However, one has to recognise and acknowledge that Nonso, quite apart from Victor, his brother, has been here since he was two years old. He has appreciated everything that has been afforded to him in this country. I ask the Minister, on compassionate and humanitarian grounds, to look favourably on this matter and to use the power that is available to him by virtue of his position, to grant leave for these people to remain in this State and to let them get on with their lives.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	208	As Deputy Cowen knows I am most familiar with this case. Indeed, I met Nonso Muojeke today in my office. Of course, I am immensely sympathetic to his situation and I understand why there is concern among his friends. However, it is important to state that there is a huge volume of misinformation in the public domain about this case, and this is a concern to me. As the House knows, as Minister for Justice and Equality it is not my practice to either comment publicly on individual cases or to interfere in a case that is still before the courts. I have been informed that the legal team of the appellant has lodged papers yesterday seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, so this case remains sub judice and, accordingly, I am particularly constrained in what I can say. Last year alone there were over 2,290 individual applications made for international protection by asylum seekers. Each of these cases is processed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, in accordance with the law. In going about its work, INIS is acting in the name of the Minister for Justice and Equality, but from a practical point of view I do not intervene in the processing of cases which are governed by clear laws and procedures and subject at all times to the supervision of the courts. From time to time a case will come to me directly for consideration, and I have given an undertaking that when this particular case has concluded in the courts I will give the application full consideration on humanitarian grounds. I pledge to do that. More generally, while control of our borders and the operation of an effective immigration system are important duties of State, Ireland has always been recognised as an open and welcoming society which operates an open regime with many pathways for non-EEA nationals to enter and remain in the State lawfully. This duty is at all times subject to the law, including our international human rights obligations.  As I have already mentioned, INIS manages Ireland’s immigration law on a daily basis. This is a huge undertaking. In 2017, there were over 250,000 applications in areas ranging from visa applications to citizenship applications to permissions to reside in the State. When a person comes to Ireland seeking international protection status he or she enters a legal process, during which all aspects of the applicant’s case, including full consideration of his or her rights to a private and a family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, are considered in some detail. A decision is made and the applicant is either granted international protection status, granted a formal permission to remain in Ireland or is told that he or she does not qualify for either status and must therefore leave the State.  In circumstances where a person’s case is refused and he or she does not avail of the option to voluntarily return to his or her country of origin, a deportation order will be made. That person will be given time to get his or her affairs in order before removal from the State. The Deputies should note that the decision to make a deportation order are not made lightly. In fact, far from it. The process is exhaustive, with various avenues of appeal open to those who get a negative outcome at first instance. These decisions of the Department are subject to appeal, including judicial review in the superior courts. INIS processes hundreds of thousands of cases each year. I do not personally see these cases, and with the volume concerned nor could I be expected to. This case was treated in the same manner as other such cases.  Immigration officials often have the difficult task of balancing the individual rights of persons with the wider obligation to maintain the integrity of the State’s immigration system, taking all factors and the circumstances of each case into account. Some decisions are appealed to the courts and at that stage become sub judice. This is the situation that has pertained in this case, so I have to comment that the matter is before the courts. Once this case has concluded before the courts, however, I will give due consideration to the circumstances of the case, including any humanitarian considerations. Under international law, Ireland is obliged to operate an international protection mechanism under which those who come to our shores seeking international protection can have their claims fully considered. I am satisfied that the mechanisms in place under the International Protection Act 2015 provide for a fair and comprehensive examination of each claim made before a decision is taken to grant or refuse international protection, or to grant or refuse permission to remain.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	I thank the Minister for his response and I note what he has said. He started by saying that while he was sympathetic towards the case, he was concerned that certain aspects of it are not in the public domain. That is worrying. I realise the duty of Deputy Flanagan, as Minister with responsibility for these issues, and of the State to act in accordance with various human rights norms. I recognise that the Minister and the Department have a duty to implement the laws concerning such applications that exist in this land. Of course I do. There is also a duty on the State, and on the arms of the State that have charge of that responsibility to follow their processes. In 2009, they did not. It was not until 2016 that this applicant sought to revoke the deportation order. I am puzzled to hear that an application has been made to the Supreme Court. I am not aware of that, and I spoke to the legal representatives earlier today. That notwithstanding, it has not been granted. The Minister has an opportunity to intervene at this stage if he so wishes. I take him at his word when he says that he will not intervene now but he will do so when the Supreme Court has had its say, irrespective of what the verdict might be, but especially if it is a negative one. In the meantime, during that process, irrespective of who was at fault, which somebody may well have been, these children were enrolled in State schools and were afforded an education. They were afforded a welcome by the staff and pupils and by the communities they resided in, so much so that 20,000 people saw fit to sign a petition to implore the Minister to use the powers available to him. I would not make a habit of this, nor would I expect anybody else within the Chamber to do so. There are times, however, when one has to stand up. There are times when one has to recognise that this modern country, and the modern generation of which these children are members, do not see the barriers that existed in Ireland in years past. The recent referendum showed us that the prejudices that existed in other generations thankfully do not exist in the present and upcoming generations. If the Minister has made a decision not to intervene at this stage, which is his right, based on information that an application has been made to the Supreme Court and has been accepted - information that was not available to me when I spoke to the applicant's legal counsel earlier today - perhaps he will agree to intervene on the conclusion of that process, when he believes he has a right to do so. I accept, acknowledge and appreciate that. I would have hoped, however, that it could have been done earlier. I hear what the Minister has said. We will hold him to his word, and I expect those who signed that petition, everybody associated with this and those watching will do the same. Without a doubt, we acknowledge the duty of the Minister, the State and the Government to uphold the law of the land. If the Minister upholds the law of the land, however, he must ensure that the armoury available to it is acted upon. If it were acted upon in this case, maybe we would not be here today.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	210	I repeat my concern that there has been a great deal of misinformation about this case in the public domain. I want to state clearly that Nonso Muojeke is not at any immediate risk of deportation. The Irish Nationalisation and Immigration Service has given that undertaking to the court. This case is still before the courts. As I have consistently said, as Minister for Justice and Equality I do not interfere with cases that are before the courts. When the court proceedings conclude, however, I will use my powers as Minister to consider this case fully, including from a humanitarian point of view. As Minister, I do exercise ministerial discretion from time to time. Having a functioning and transparent system is a critical component of immigration systems, not only here in Ireland but right across the world. I remind Deputies that 2,926 individual applications for international protection made were made last year alone. Applicants for international protection from the UN-recognised refugee-producing countries are prioritised. Each applicant is required to comply with the laws of the country during the time their application is being processed. Ireland has reformed its immigration system to address lengthy time periods associated with applications. With the commencement of the 2015 Act on 31 December 2016, we now have a single procedure. This is the biggest reform of our protection process in more than 20 years. It is in line with our intention to provide first-instance decisions in the shortest possible timeframe. I do not doubt the sincerity of Deputy Cowen. I hope that is mutual. I regret that I cannot comment on individual cases that are before the courts because they are undergoing due process. I assure Deputy Cowen and the House, however, that once the court proceedings have concluded, I can give the facts and the circumstances of the case in question full consideration, which I intend to do.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	211	As the Minister for Health is aware, we have been around the houses on this today, in the Committee of Public Accounts and on Leaders' Questions. The hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts was extraordinary for the lack of information that the acting chief executive of the HSE has on this issue. He has met Dr. Scally only once. Also, the programme manager of CervicalCheck has never met him or spoken to him. While what Dr. Scally has said about the provision of information is accurate, the head of the programme offered him a facility through the HSE for direct electronic access to all the information he required. The head of the HSE did not know that today until I pointed it out to him, even though he was sitting beside him. He complimented him on putting it forward, even though I had to go through the management system. My issue is that I sat down with the Minister and negotiated in good faith on several occasions. Through its spokespeople, the Dáil decided to go forward with this scoping inquiry, which I now regret because I think we should have voted on it. My concern is that this scoping inquiry has drifted into becoming something different. The Dáil also decided the timeline. The date of completion was the end of June. Now the Government has decided to push that back to the end of August. I want a guarantee from the Minister that this will not drift beyond the end of August, and that he will call back the Dáil so we can set up the commission of investigation. The latter point is not for debate, despite Dr. Scally saying numerous times in interviews that he would decide whether one was needed. Will the Minister give this House a guarantee that this will happen? I am concerned that this will continue to creep. I do knot know if Dr. Scally will be able to complete the work, as he feels it is constituted, by the end of August. I understood that he was to have quick facts, that he would ascertain the key requirements for the terms of reference, and that then we would set up the commission of investigation. That was his role as I understood it. I commend him as a person. His CV is excellent. However, this has gone way too far.I do not believe we will get the quick information we require for the families of the women who have died and for all of the women who are in very difficult health situations currently who need answers quickly. If the Government, as opposed to the Dáil, has decided that this will go to August I want it absolutely guaranteed that it will be concluded by August, because the commission of investigation cannot commence until the Dáil is sitting. The Minister will have to bring back the Dáil on 1 September, or a date close to it, for the investigation to commence. This is not what was agreed. I am willing to give its completion the benefit of the doubt, if that is what the Minister advocates, however, that date must be locked down. I want all ten terms of reference fully completed by that date. I also want to see a complete change in attitude from the HSE on information provision and how Dr. Scally gets access to people and information for this. The Minister has a role to play in this. I request specifically that the Minister actually meets the people in CervicalCheck in Limerick. They have asked me to ask him to do so to get a full picture of what is going on.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	212	I accept Deputy Kelly's invitation to visit CervicalCheck in Limerick. We are entering a frantic number of weeks with regard to legislation, but at the earliest possible opportunity I will visit there. It would be extremely beneficial. I also want to thank the people who have been working on the front line. I believe they have been working extraordinary hours in recent weeks and months to try to get on top of this. I heard Deputy Kelly acknowledge this earlier at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting. I thank Deputy Kelly for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to update the House and answer some of the questions he put to me directly. For the record of the House, on Tuesday I published two interim reports prepared by Dr. Scally outlining the work he has carried out so far as part of his scoping inquiry to date. One report is a progress update and the other is a first report addressing point D of the terms of reference on information for women about screening. This is a very important area of work. There are nine other areas, but I know we agree rebuilding confidence in the screening programme is very important with regard to what women are told when they go to the screening programme about consent and open disclosure. I welcome Dr. Scally's recommendations, as I know the Irish Cancer Society does. I have heard a number of women and next of kin who have been impacted by the audits welcome it also. I have accepted all six recommendations in full. I also welcome his approach to the work. I welcome the fact Dr. Scally seems absolutely to have the confidence not just of people in this House but of the families with whom he is interacting. I have heard some very positive feedback from them and from some patient advocacy groups in terms of how he is going about his work. I thank Deputy Kelly for acknowledging this. Deputy Kelly is right that Dr. Scally has requested he be allowed to continue his work until the end of the summer. He said to me quite honestly that he could, in theory, rush his report but he did not believe it would do justice to the issue and that he would like to work his way through the summer months. This reflects the need to engage with more women and families affected and also to go through the sheer volume of documentation that he has received. Importantly, he has not said by any manner or means that he is off until the end of the summer, good night and good luck. He has said he will continue to provide discrete reports as they are completed so we can get on with implementing some of the practical changes. I would like to see something on governance, on which he is working within the terms of reference, and something on the laboratories and the review of contracts. I welcome the fact that today the HSE confirmed he will get access to those contracts very quickly. This is vital. I want to be crystal clear on the record of the House that there is no ambiguity about this. There will be a commission of inquiry. There will be a statutory inquiry. I am committed to establishing one. I brought a memo to the Government to establish one. Let us be honest, I have to acknowledge that when I first came into the House it was my original intention to set up a HIQA inquiry. Deputy Kelly pointed out the limitations of this and advocated very strongly. We worked on a cross-party basis. There will be a commission of inquiry. I believe, as do most people in the House, that there is value in Dr. Scally answering as many of those terms of references as he possibly can over the summer period so we do not have to put a huge body of work into a commission that could go on for far too long. I want to stress that Dr. Scally is very committed to the work. It is important we give him the time he has requested to complete his inquiry in a comprehensive manner. He has asked that that be until the end of the summer. It should be acknowledged that Dr. Scally was only requested to provide an update on progress at this stage but he went further than that in providing one other report. One of the recommendations made was on an ex gratia payment, which obviously we accepted in full. I want to say on the record, in case of any confusion, this is not instead of compensation, redress or support packages. It is an additional support and its sole purpose is to ensure there are no financial obstacles to any woman or her family participating fully in the inquiry. Deputy Kelly knows that the recalling of the Dáil and when the Dáil sits is not a matter for me, but if Deputy Kelly is asking me whether I want to see the commission of inquiry established in September and whether I want to work with Members of the House to make it happen the answer is that I do. I will work and engage, as I believe I have shown to date I would like to do, with the Opposition on what exactly we should put into the commission of investigation.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	213	I respect Dr. Scally. I respect the manner in which the Minister has engaged with me on this issue. I thank him for the changes he has taken on board from my suggestions throughout this. However, my issue here is very clear. I am afraid of creep, and to date this has crept enormously. Dr. Scally's comments in the media really worried me, when he thought there may not be need for a commission of investigation. His scoping is very tight. There are ten terms of reference but they are only to find the basic facts. One of the things I believe he has to do is get the cytology results of the 209 women by laboratory, by date, by grade, by cytologist and graph them and show where the issues are and, basically, put it out there so we can see where the problems are. We do not have time to document all of these poor women's stories. They do not have the time. Remember, these are the same laboratories with the same shiny accreditation using the same staff and quality assurance and under the same tenders that are carrying out the smears now as in the 209 cases, which number, we heard today, will increase. My real issue is that as long as this creep and this drift towards a longer period continues we will not get to the bottom of how these women ended up in the situation in the first place. We need to get there quickly and then we need an investigation as to what happened. We need to make decisions based on Dr. Scally's scoping exercise. The Minister has to ensure it is completed by August because I will come back in here, and the Minister knows I will, if this is not concluded by August. If I find out at the end of August this has not concluded I will know we are not doing the best for these women. Will the Minister please go to Limerick and ask Dr. Scally to engage with the people in Limerick and meet the programme manager, who has never spoken to him, which is extraordinary? Will the Minister please get to the bottom of the issue that Dr. Scally has identified with regard to information provision? By all accounts, at the very beginning the programme manager offered him full direct electronic access, so who in the HSE blocked it and why? We must remember the chief executive is on record as saying he did not have a clue this happened.

I just read in the news headlines as I came down the good news that Vicky Phelan received today, which I welcome and I am sure Deputy Kelly does also.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	215	Absolutely, 100%. It is great news. It is fabulous news.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	216	It is appropriate that Deputy Kelly and I acknowledge this, along with everyone in the House, because we would not be here if it were not for the work she did. Deputy Kelly's concerned about time creep is genuine, and it is a good way of putting the idea that this could slip on and on. We need to get the answer. The idea of the scoping inquiry is to get the answer. I am very satisfied that Dr. Gabriel Scally will get a lot of good answers. This is a man who, as Deputy Kelly rightly acknowledged, has a very impressive CV and track record. He calls it as he sees it and we saw that this week. He does not take any messing around from anyone. With regard to the issue of documents and information, I could not have been clearer with him and, in fairness, he said this publicly. I took the opportunity to phone him again yesterday to tell him if he encountered any blockage from anyone in getting any information or any records to tell me directly. He said he appreciated that and he would be back to me if it arose. I have legal powers to request documentation from the HSE and make it available to others. I do not believe I will need to use them because everyone has said they will co-operate, but I will stop at nothing to make sure he gets the information that he requires. I also want to pick up the point Deputy Kelly made, quite rightly, and it was raised at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts today, on the number of cases being likely to increase. It is important that as audits are carried out and completed they are disclosed to women. Had that happened in the first place we would not have the awful mess in which women have found themselves, where information about their own health care was concealed.Auditing is good but not disclosing audit results is the problem. I expect, as the audits are completed, that the women will be first to be notified. It will not be this House or the media but rather the women who will be informed about their medical records. Dr. Scally will be kept informed in this regard. I am absolutely committed to setting up a commission of inquiry in September and working with the Opposition to ensure that is as effective as possible. I thank Dr. Scally for his superb work and I look forward to more of his recommendations.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	217	I raise the issue of a lack of a designated expert in the Health Service Executive, HSE, for those individuals who suffer from Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, EDS. The Minister is aware that this is a group of syndromes relating to connective tissue disorders. The way in which they affect patients varies greatly. For some, the condition can have a profound impact on the quality of life. It has an impact not just on health but in many cases on an individual's mobility. That can range from relatively normal to very severe. I will raise two cases in Clare with which I am very familiar. The first is Aoife Sage and the other is Zara Cronin. Aoife was diagnosed aged nine and her condition since has deteriorated rapidly from initially having some weakness or fatigue, with episodes of fainting and dizziness, to what is now joint pain and the requirement for a wheelchair. She is now 14. She suffers from instability in the neck and with certain movements her neck becomes dislocated. One can imagine the impact this has had on Aoife, who is unable to attend school. Her condition now is such that home schooling is not even an option for her. There is no care available for her in the Republic. She has visited London for certain scans and there is some assistance in that regard. However, her condition, bad and all as it is, can be improved, along with her quality of life and mobility, if she can access surgical intervention that fuses parts of the head and spine. I am no medical expert in that regard but I understand her parents have consulted with a private clinic in Barcelona. I am aware that in the case of Zara Cronin the same solution could apply. I am also aware of a number of other cases throughout the country. They are relatively small in number but we understand there could be a significant benefit for those sufferers if they could access the surgery. The difficulty is the State is not in a position or has not been in a position to provide funding as the available care is not in the public service anywhere in Europe. It is, however, provided for in this clinic in Barcelona. It is pretty clear from what I have seen and read that this intervention would have a very significant impact on the lives of the two girls with whom I am familiar. It is incumbent on us in this House and in the Department not to stand back from intervention because it is exploratory or at an early stage when there are recognised positive benefits for others. I appeal to the Minister to look at the cases again. I know there has been some communication between the Department and these families and others with a view to providing funding at this stage to ensure these children can be treated in the private facility in Barcelona. We can then develop our skill sets so we can try to be in a position to treat other individuals who will present at a later stage. I accept it is not possible to put in place that clinical care and intervention overnight here but it is available elsewhere. I met the parents of these girls and Aoife's have had to do a crowdfunding exercise. I attended an event in Shannon the other night where the families and friends from the area around Sixmilebridge, Shannon and Newmarket came together in desperation to try to put funds together to help this family. The people on the ground get it and understand the positive impact that this family could experience. Anybody I have spoken with who knows the family, in some cases better and for longer than me, knows this is genuine and this will make a difference if the surgery is successful. It cannot be done without money. I know we have come through a difficult time in the country but in this day and age should we be seeing a family effectively begging from their neighbours to collect money in order to have a medical service provided to their beautiful daughter? It says much about how we as a society react to children in dire circumstances. In fairness, the Minister while in the Department has demonstrated a great capacity to address serious matters as they arise. I hope he can do the same here and deliver some good news. I hope he will be in a position to meet the parents of these two children who might act as a representative of others suffering the same condition.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	218	I thank Deputy Dooley for raising this important matter. He is entirely right when he says people on the ground get it and we need to do better. It is a fair summary. I have been familiarising myself with the condition in recent months and as the Deputy correctly states, I have heard from a number of families doing the very best for their children. I would be happy to facilitate a meeting with the Deputy and some of these parents to discuss the matter in the coming weeks. We can set that up shortly. I thank the Deputy for providing an opportunity to outline where we are and what we can do to ensure we better serve these children in future. EDS is classified as a rare disease, which is defined in the European Union, EU, as a disease or disorder affecting fewer than five in 10,000 of the European population. Although each disease is individually rare, there are a great many rare diseases. Collectively, rare diseases affect a large number of people and are significant contributors to a number of population health outcomes in terms of their high mortality, morbidity and disability. Ireland published a national plan for rare diseases in July 2014. On foot of the plan a national clinical programme for rare diseases and a rare disease office has been established. In 2017, the Department published a progress report and update on all 48 recommendations of the rare disease plan. This interim report represents a detailed review of the implementation of the national plan. EDS is not one condition, as the Deputy knows, but a group of several clinically distinct conditions. It has a relatively high prevalence of one in 5,000. It affects the connective tissues and most commonly can cause joint hypermobility. Once diagnosed, joint hypermobility syndrome can be treated with a mixture of exercise and physiotherapy. An exercise programme to improve fitness and muscle strength may also be effective at reducing pain. The nature of joint hypermobility syndrome means that patients are at increased risk of injuries such as dislocations and soft tissue injuries. Managing joint hypermobility may, therefore, involve treating short-term injuries as they arise while following a long-term treatment plan. The more severe forms of EDS, as the Deputy referred to, require specialist treatment often by multiple specialists but usually under the care of the specialist for the most severely affected organ system. These specialists can be paediatric cardiologists, rheumatologists, neurologists and orthopaedic surgeons. Where surgery is required, it is provided for in the context of surgical and orthopaedic services for patients with EDS. The most severe cases of EDS are rare and are usually managed by specialists at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. I am advised by the HSE that the total number of patients with severe EDS nationally is between 20 and 40 patients. In late 2017, the HSE national clinical programme for rheumatology completed a significant piece of work relating to a model of care for rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this is at the final stages of approval by our health service. This model aims to ensure that the patient is seen, assessed and treated by the right person in the right place and in the timeliest manner. With the implementation of this model of care, the programme will develop disease-specific pathways for disease groups, including EDS as part of hypermobility diseases. There is a new plan coming down the tracks that will include patients with EDS. I thank the Deputy for his helpful comments and suggestions. EDS is, without doubt, a significant condition causing very distressing symptoms and may often require a range of specialist multidisciplinary treatments. We need to do better by these children. For those patients most severely affected where surgery is required, surgical treatment, especially in children, forms part of the current management of symptoms.I especially welcome the ongoing work of the national clinical programme for rheumatology and its new model of care for patients, which includes EDS as part of hypermobility diseases. This can bring us to higher terrain in how we care for patients in this country.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	I welcome the Minister's commitment at least to meet the parents of the two children in question. I will be in contact with his office and we will try to arrange such a meeting in the next week or so. What is clear from the Minister's answer is that the HSE is still of the belief that it has an appropriate plan and model of care to deal with these complex cases. My interaction with the families indicates that is not the case, and I hope this will be brought home to the Minister when he meets the parents. While some of it is exploratory, good work is being done in Barcelona on cranial fusion and fusion within the spine. The Minister should see some examples of this work. The HSE will obviously want to manage this disease in Ireland, but we must be prepared to look elsewhere, as we do with the management of other diseases for which we access care in other countries when specialist training is not available here. The families are familiar with what can be done and want to stand by their daughters and give them every chance. The State has a duty and an obligation to assist them in this regard. For this reason, rather than getting into a set piece here, I would like to engage with the Minister and his Department to try to find some way of assisting the families. It is not fair, given everything they must do for their children, that these parents should spend valuable time trying to fundraise from a community that is nonetheless prepared to help. Up to €100,000 would be required to cover the various costs associated with a family relocating to Spain for a period. For a community such as County Clare to fundraise for two families is too great a burden. It is incumbent on us to resolve the matter here and to do so, if necessary, by way of a pilot project or programme in order that we will learn and benefit from it and that other children who present in future will have the benefit of the learning these families will, I hope, be in a position to provide.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	220	I assure Deputy Dooley that my answer was not meant in any way to suggest that everything is absolutely appropriate and adequate in this regard. We need to do better, which is the reason I very much welcome the new clinical programme being worked on, of which EDS is a part. I believe the programme will be welcomed by patients with EDS and their families. However, the Deputy is entirely correct that the voices of patients and their families are extremely important as we develop these plans. I would very much welcome the opportunity to meet Deputy Dooley and the families to whom he refers in the coming weeks in order that we can ensure they make an input and to see if the State can do more to support them.
#NoelRock	unknown-#NoelRock-party	unknown-#NoelRock-dob	unknown-#NoelRock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	I thank the Minister for coming into the Chamber to discuss this most important issue. The National Transport Authority's announcement on Tuesday of plans for new bus corridors in Dublin has caused confusion, unease and distress for many of the people living along the 16 affected routes. Approximately 20,000 households live along these 16 routes and it is planned to procure 1,300 portions of property by means of compulsory purchase order. As the Minister is well aware, traffic is beginning to clog up the arteries of Dublin in a way that is not sustainable and can no longer be ignored. Naturally therefore, any plan to alleviate congestion and improve the public transport offering is to be welcomed wholeheartedly. The Minister has overseen a great many public transport developments in his tenure, including the plan to electrify the DART network, the opening of Luas cross city and plans to deliver MetroLink and upgrade the Luas green line. Many capital spending plans for transport have been advanced on his watch and these will leave a tremendous legacy in the decades ahead in public transport, public investment and preventing further deterioration in traffic in Dublin. That said, the NTA's communication to the affected residents leaves much to be desired at this early stage in this sensitive process. As I said, some 20,000 households live along these 16 routes. We have been told specifically by the NTA that 1,300 households will have a portion of their property compulsorily purchased from them. If the number involved is so specific, it raises the question as to whether the NTA knows exactly which properties will be affected. I suspect it does, which raises follow-on question as to why on earth the people who will be affected were not informed, consulted, written to and treated with basic respect, not only as stakeholders in this project, but also as citizens of this country. They deserve that at the very least. It is a regrettable misstep by the National Transport Authority to announce a plan at this halfway point. The NTA will make further announcements in September concerning the affected services within the existing bus network. I am not entirely sure why it could not have liaised with the affected residents and held off on these route announcements until then. That would seem a sensible course of action. It is clear that this is not a problem of the Minister's or Department's creation. However, I would appreciate it, and I know residents in my constituency and elsewhere, particularly those affected in Rathfarnham who have been in touch with me and Deputy Colm Brophy in droves, would be very grateful if the Minister used his considerable influence to impress upon the NTA the need to learn lessons from this and to communicate better and more thoughtfully and inclusively with residents and stakeholders in future. I would appreciate the Minister's thoughts on this matter.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	222	I thank Deputy Rock for raising this extremely topical issue. It is unusual to get a Topical Issue matter under this heading, so I am very grateful to get one today. The Deputy represents very well the apprehension which obviously exists among a large number of his constituents and others that they will somehow be hit by this very dramatic, transformational and radical attack on congestion in Dublin city. I have spoken to the National Transport Authority about this matter, including its communications, and I am satisfied with its explanations, while still understanding the Deputy's view. The NTA has indicated that the launch this week related only to what it describes as indicative routes. Obviously, nothing is set in stone when one launches 16 indicative routes and changes may still be made. Identifying 1,300 houses that will be affected could be dishonest and alarmist and some of the households identified may not ultimately be affected. The NTA has, I believe, identified an approximate number as honestly as it possibly can, while leaving room for discussion on the routes. The final decision on which households will be affected will be taken soon. From my discussions with the authority, it appears that decision will be taken in October or about three months from now. What is more, the NTA is absolutely adamant that it will speak individually to every one of the affected households. It gave me that assurance this morning. Some people may look forward to a small section of their land being taken off them if the astronomical amounts appearing in the media are correct.The problem with issuing square footage valuations is that each square foot has a different valuation. Some places in south Dublin have incredibly high valuations, while others elsewhere are very low. That is also the case in north Dublin. Therefore, one could not have an average estimate by square foot.  I suspect we will see very laborious but very democratic dialogue. They will engage with each individual household on a market valuation and, inevitably, some cases will go to arbitration. The State has a mechanism for doing so. I hope it will be a dialogue that satisfies the Deputy and others who are rightly concerned and will remove the apprehension some people will have when the routes are identified in the future. That will mean that this extraordinary bold step to relieve congestion will be successful. I acknowledge that the Deputy is correct in that some people will be discomfited. That is to be regretted, but the big picture is that while we will not remove congestion forever, we will make dramatic inroads in easing it in this city. The number cycling will increase and the time it takes people to get to work will, on average, be halved. That is a serious goal we intend to achieve. I am sorry that some people will be inconvenienced, but there will be real dialogue and they will be generously compensated.
#NoelRock	unknown-#NoelRock-party	unknown-#NoelRock-dob	unknown-#NoelRock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	223	I thank the Minister who I appreciate has had negotiations with the NTA on this matter. It is clear that he is on top of the issue which he is approaching with sufficient gravity and seriousness. It is interesting that the NTA uses the phrase "indicative routes" for the mid-way plan it announced on Tuesday. It also used the phrase in describing the recent metro plans, except that in that case, while there was great dissatisfaction at the length of time the affected stakeholders - owners of properties along the route - had been given, they were told about the indicative plans. If owners of properties along the metro route were informed of indicative plans, surely it is inconsistent that those who potentially will be affected on the Bus Connects routes are not. Of course, the Minister is correct that, by their nature, indicative plans can be changed, particularly when 16 routes are being planned in parallel and I acknowledge that it is entirely possible that many, perhaps even all, of the routes will change somewhat as the public consultation process gathers steam. However, I believe one critical component, regrettably, has been overlooked in the NTA's communication. Significant numbers of people have been upset. The No. 44 bus links the Minister's home area of Enniskerry with mine. I wonder if I were to hop on the No. 44 bus to Enniskerry tomorrow morning to knock on 100 doors and tell 100 people that roughly 5% of them would lose their gardens, would they be concerned, upset, distressed and alarmed. That is effectively what has happened. There are 20,000 properties along the 16 routes and we were told a specific number of owners, 1,300, or between 5% and 7%. would lose a portion of their property. The question is outstanding and one we will have to put to the NTA when its representatives are before the transport committee next week. Nevertheless, I appreciate the level of engagement and the fact that the Minister has pointed out that it is a radical plan, which it is. Dublin needs such a radical plan to deal with public transport issues. I have full confidence that the Minister is aware of how cohesive that plan needs to be and hope that in coming years we will manage to deliver on it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	224	Everything the Deputy has said is authentic and genuine and we should take what he is saying to heart. The consultation process will be extremely extensive and I think the dialogue will be successful, but that does not meant that there will not be court cases. There always are and there will be some, but I do not think we should lose sight of the big picture which is halving the time it takes people to get to work. In fact, they will be more than halved because if we continue on our current course, travelling times and traffic congestion will continue to increase. Instead, we will have a speedy, reliable bus service which will move at a pace we have not seen before. People will get to work and arrive home earlier and buses will be able to keep to timetables, something they could not do before. It is also part of climate change policy and the programme for the removal of carbon emissions which we have been pursuing with increasing vigour and on which we need to play catch-up. Having 200 km of dedicated, segregated cycling lanes beside the new bus lanes is quite new and something we should all welcome. We will also have pedestrian lanes beside them which will encourage people to walk to work. It is all part of a big picture. The Deputy is talking about something that is important to the individuals concerned. If, in the future, he wishes to bring people to meet me to discuss the issue, I will be happy to transfer their views to the NTA rather than interfere directly. I am conscious, as I have been about the difficulties at the airport, that some people are concerned and that there are those whose lifestyles will be changed. It is a consideration we must take into account.
#KateOConnell	unknown-#KateOConnell-party	unknown-#KateOConnell-dob	unknown-#KateOConnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	225	I move:That Dáil Éireann shall consider the Report of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs entitled, Report on Cyber Security for Children and Young Adults, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 28th March 2018.The report on cybersecurity for children and young adults produced by the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs is important in tackling an issue which is becoming ever more challenging for younger generations and increasingly worrisome for parents and guardians. On behalf of the Chairman, my colleague, Deputy Alan Farrell, I thank the members of the committee for the work they put into producing the report and their careful consideration throughout the extensive hearings on the matter. I also thank every delegate who provided testimony for the committee and each individual and organisation that made a submission on the topic of cyber safety for children and young people. It is important that the Government act on the recommendations made by the committee. They will protect young people, while also acknowledging the benefits of the Internet and social media, particularly in the context of education and communicating with family and friends.  Reviewing the work of the committee on the topic, the contributions which really stood out were those of students from Newbridge College and representatives from Comhairle na nÓg in counties Clare and Wicklow. That the committee used the opportunity to hear first-hand the concerns and experiences of young people was positive. Of the challenges faced by young people, sexting, over-sharing online, cyberbullying and the danger of connecting with strangers online are of particular concern.As a society, we cannot put our heads in the sand and pretend these things are not happening. As legislators we have a responsibility to lead by example, to acknowledge the reality our young people are facing online, to have an open and frank discussion about it and to work to ensure children and teenagers are fully aware of the dangers they may be exposed to and the supports available to them in this regard. One student from Newbridge College discussed the sharing of intimate images online in her contribution. She stated:It is very much a taboo subject, which people shy away from discussing, but it must be addressed. Many of the teenagers engaging in these activities are not informed of the dangers or the legalities relating to the sharing of intimate images.This student went on to say: I believe this issue is getting out of control and becoming a popular trend due to the lack of education and information provided to young people. We can help prevent and tackle this by raising awareness and being taught the dangers of sexting in school as part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum or the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, module.This one contribution highlights the importance with which teenagers view the need the act on social media dangers. It shows a level of understanding and awareness that may be somewhat lacking in those in our society who may be less au fait with social media and with new messaging apps, which are being used by children, teenagers and young people today. It also shows the need to make sure every individual is aware of the right to be forgotten, which is referenced in the report before the House. In tackling the concerns of our young people, we must first remove the taboo with which matters such as sexting are often treated and ensure social media companies strengthen their safety policies to protect their users, especially when they are minors. It is for this reason the report of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on cybersafety is so timely and important and must be acted upon by Government. We cannot deny that our young people are, in many ways, leading when it comes to addressing concerns in the area of cybersafety. At the same hearing of the committee, a representative of Clare Comhairle na nÓg outlined the action it had taken in terms of being proactive and working to provide its members' peers with the knowledge and education they deserve. This young person outlined the work of Clare Comhairle na nÓg saying:Changes in technology, in particular the availability of broadband and cheaper smartphones with data bundles, have changed the cyber landscape in recent years. In response to young people looking for some direction and education in this rapidly changing environment, we made links with McAfee which had developed a cybersafety programme as part of its corporate social responsibility, CSR, project. The programme was piloted with 49 young people at the 2015 comhairle AGM and the results were fed back to McAfee. Clare youth service decided to deliver this programme with funding from the Clare local development company, and during 2016 and 2017, 752 young people, mainly first years, took part in the programme in schools across Clare. McAfee has adapted the programme according to the feedback from the young people involved.With regard to the committee’s report itself, broadly speaking, the recommendations encompass a number of policy areas and have the potential to be particularly effective, not only in addressing the challenges posed by social media and the online world, but also in educating and encouraging our society in general regarding the responsible use of the Internet. Focusing on the area of education, with recommendations that include peer-to-peer workshops in schools, the inclusion of cybersafety programmes in the curriculum and in teacher training courses and the appointment of teachers as digital safety ambassadors, this report provides a guideline on how we can best build upon and complement existing initiatives in a number of our schools. The initiative to involve young people in the delivery of education and awareness evenings for parents and guardians on this topic would also be worthwhile. Gone are the days when adults could impose their views or impose restrictions on young people. Instead we must fully include children, teenagers and young adults in all measures to ensure they are safe online. I commend the committee on taking on board the importance of utilising such an approach.  As pointed out in the committee report, the implementation of the remaining recommendations as set out in the report of the Internet content governance advisory group of 2014, the establishment of the office of a digital safety commissioner and the introduction of a national strategy on children’s cybersafety must be prioritised by Government. The establishment of an advisory task force on the protection of children and young people online must also be progressed by Government. I note that the recommendation on the digital age of consent has been addressed within the Data Protection Act 2018. However, we await the legislative changes recommended in the report in line with the Law Reform Commission’s report on harmful communication and digital safety; particularly that section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 should be repealed and replaced with a new offence of harassment.  A new provision of harassment must, in this context, expressly apply to harassment through all forms of communication including digital and online communications. It is an unfortunate reality, as I am sure many members of this House will agree, that the majority of harassment now takes place online. While we, as Members of the House, have become used to such harassment at times, the fact remains that people not in the public sphere, and young people in particular, may not be as prepared to deal with such harassment or abuse as we may be. Therefore, the laws of this State must reflect this reality, and as such, this legislative change must be made.  Separate to this offence, and also in line with the Law Reform Commission’s recommendations, a specific stalking offence should be introduced. Furthermore, section 1 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 must be repealed and replaced with provisions making the distribution of threatening, false, indecent or obscene messages an offence, whether they are to a person or about a person. In addition, the distribution of intimate images without the consent of the person depicted in such images must be made an offence. This also is a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission’s report. The fact that the Law Reform Commission made these recommendations and that the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs has now highlighted the importance of these legislative changes must act as a catalyst for the Government to take action urgently. As legislators, we have a responsibility to ensure every individual in this State, and particularly some of the more vulnerable members of our society, including our children and young adults, receive the levels of legal protection they need. Unfortunately, at this time, we cannot say we have adequately done this with regard to cybersafety. Our society is becoming increasingly dependent on technology in every aspect whether it is in education, in work, or in communicating with one another generally. Our laws must now catch up. Failure to adequately implement the recommendations of the committee’s report on cybersafety for children and young people would be to fail our children, our young people and our society in general in terms of providing every citizen with the levels of online security and protection they require.  Again, I wish to thank all of the members of the committee and those who provided testimony and submission to the committee for their work and consideration of this topic. I commend this report to the House and look forward to the detailed scrutiny of this report by Cabinet given the multidepartmental scope of the recommendations.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	226	I very much welcome the opportunity to speak to the House today on the important subject of cybersafety. I welcome the excellent work done by the joint committee in preparing its report on cybersafety. It was timely when it was done and it is timely now. I appreciate and was aware of the great commitment, dynamism and passion of members of the committee and the ways in which it worked together and with other groups and those whom it brought in to speak and to provide evidence, especially the young people.I know that members invested significant time and effort in studying this topic and in developing a series of recommended actions. I am aware that the committee took into account the recommendations of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group in producing its report. Reference was made a couple of times to the Law Reform Commission. The issue of safety for children engaging in online activity presents a serious challenge. Protecting children from online abuse, bullying, grooming and sites with harmful content requires a whole-of-Government approach. Given the cross-departmental nature of this issue, the Department of the Taoiseach is currently developing an action plan on online safety involving all relevant Departments. The Taoiseach, in addressing the open policy debate on online safety, held in March, committed to the preparation of such a plan by the end of June. It will set out an integrated set of measures to ensure we support online safety at all levels. That was taking up part of the character of the committee's report in terms of encouraging a sense of urgency in regard to the Government. Preparation of the action plan is well advanced, with six Departments, all with responsibilities in this area, working on a collaborative basis to ensure a robust, whole-of-Government approach to the issue of online safety. The objective is to ensure our collective actions are co-ordinated, complementary and robust. The work of the committee will help to shape the Government's approach to dealing with this issue. Deputies will appreciate that I do not have lead ministerial policy responsibility in this area and in the circumstances I do not propose to respond directly to the recommendations in the report. I do, however, have significant responsibilities and an important contribution to make in ensuring that the Internet is a safer place for children. In this context, Deputies will be aware that the Children First Act 2015 places a number of statutory obligations on organisations providing relevant services to children. These obligations include a requirement to keep children safe from harm while they are availing of services, a requirement to carry out a risk assessment and a requirement to prepare a child safeguarding statement that sets out the policies and procedures in place to mitigate these risks. If a relevant service is allowing children access to the Internet where they could become exposed to harm, including harm of assault or sexual abuse, as set out in section 2 of the Act, there is an obligation on the service provider to ensure the risk is identified and that the policies and procedures that are in place to manage the risk are set out in the child safeguarding statement. Chapter 4 of the Children First guidance provides guidance for relevant service providers on preparing risk assessments and child safeguarding statements. It defines a risk assessment as an exercise where an organisation examines all aspects of its service from a safeguarding perspective to establish whether there are any practices or features of the services that have the potential to put children at risk. While this includes the risk of harm as a result of access to the Internet, this is not currently explicitly stated in the guidance. In order to clarify the issue, my Department will be amending the Children First guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety when conducting risk assessments and preparing child safeguarding statements. In addition, we will be consulting Tusla to ensure that the template for the completion of the child safeguarding statement also includes a specific reference to the need to consider online safety. It is my responsibility to ensure that the voices of children and young people are heard and acted upon when we make decisions on Internet safety. My Department undertakes and supports a wide range of consultation and participation processes with children and young people. These include the development of structures to enable such participation in decision-making by children and young people. Such structures include both Dáil na nÓg and Comhairle na nÓg. The joint Oireachtas committee met groups of young people from Comhairle na nÓg from counties Clare and Wicklow as part of its work. Deputy Kate O'Connell, on behalf of Deputy Farrell, has already referred to the committee's work. I was pleased and heartened to see colleagues take the time to listen to what young people have to say. It is through such engagement that we can learn and find solutions that work. I met some members after the meeting and realise how engaging and meaningful it was for them. They were extraordinarily receptive to the young people. Consultation work undertaken by Wicklow Comhairle na nÓg resulted in a charter on cyberbullying, as referred to by Deputy Kate O'Connell. This charter makes requests of us all. It asks that we have a plan for dealing with cyberbullying and that we protect young people, their rights and their well-being. The charter also speaks to bullies, to those being bullied, to bystanders and to all young people. While this initiative is local to County Wicklow, the message coming from young people has much wider application. The learning is that technology, per se, is not the problem; rather, people's behaviour is the problem. I know that the committee also met Clare Comhairle na nÓg and heard of the successful initiative with McAfee that has resulted in a cybersafety programme. Reference was made to how the programme is being rolled out through Clare Youth Service and other Youth Work Ireland regions. These initiatives, developed by young people, are real examples of a global and universal problem finding local solutions, generated and owned by young people themselves. No doubt, they are looking for innovative ways to ensure that what they advocate will be followed by their friends and colleagues and others. My Department also provides funding to three national youth organisations that provide online safety resources for the youth sector. The National Youth Council of Ireland provides the web safety in youth work resource for young people; SpunOut, Ireland's youth information website, has developed an online safety hub that provides guidelines for young people on online safety; and Youth Work Ireland, in conjunction with McAfee Security, has developed a digital safety programme that highlights the risks associated with online activity. As we know, the Internet is not age-bound. The risks and dangers apply to people of all ages. Children, however, are particularly vulnerable and need greater protection. This is why I welcome the work of the committee and the report. The challenges are not just for the Government; they are for all of society. There is also a role for parents and for industry and each must play its part. Parents are crucial actors in helping to ensure that children are safe online and particularly in establishing and maintaining ongoing open communication with their children so that where risks arise, children feel able to discuss them with their parents. The Government recognises the importance of the provision of reliable information to parents to equip them in supporting children's safety online, and this will be reflected in the forthcoming action plan for online safety. Strengthening and consolidating information, support and services will be a key focus for the Department in the coming years and I will be outlining steps in that regard in the forthcoming early years strategy. The Internet operates across borders so the challenges we meet often arise from decisions taken outside our jurisdiction. Some solutions are outside our control but we have the advantage that many of the world's leading technology companies have a significant corporate presence here in Ireland. They can and must work with the Government in making the Internet a safer place. We need a truly joined-up approach in addressing the issue of cybersafety. The committee pointed this out. Dealing with the criminal behaviour associated with the Internet is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality. Facilitating technology is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The Department of Education and Skills plays a valuable role in regard to Internet safety in schools. The Department of Health has a particular interest through mental health and well-being services, and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has responsibilities regarding industry and e-commerce. I am fully committed to playing my part in a co-ordinated cross-Government approach to dealing with this issue, particularly as it relates to children. I acknowledge again the excellent work of the committee and can assure the House that the findings and recommendations in its report will be taken into account as part of the work being done by the Taoiseach's office in preparing a national action plan on online safety. As I stated, that plan is at an advanced stage of preparation.

I attended every one of the sessions along with my colleagues. They were most informative, enjoyable and enlightening. It is a pity that they were on at 10 a.m. If they were on at 10 p.m., parents would actually have got an awful lot more out of them. As a parent, I got right into it. Having a 16 year old, a 15 year old and a 13 year old, I was hearing it all from all angles, and I really enjoyed it. I want to acknowledge the stakeholders who appeared before the committee because they played an invaluable role in giving up their time to inform us about the issue. However, as the Minister said, they were not informing just one Department but a minimum of six Departments. That is the wonderful aspect of the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs. We do not hold all the work to ourselves, unlike the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. We shared it on this issue with the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality but we also shared it with the committees on health, education, climate change, mental health and enterprise and innovation. We had a broad section of people appear before us on this issue, including representatives of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children; Webwise; Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, Special Rapporteur on Child Protection; the Law Reform Commission; the special crime operations section and the national protective services bureau of An Garda Síochána; the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, to which I will refer shortly; and Facebook. Regrettably, representatives of Snapchat refused to appear before us but in fairness to Niamh Sweeney and her colleague from Facebook, they appeared before us on the industry aspect. We also had representatives from Newbridge College, Wicklow Comhairle na nÓg and Clare Comhairle na nÓg. At the end, we had Dr. Mary Aiken and Professor Barry O'Sullivan. It is important to mention also the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group, which was led by Professor Brian O'Neill, as well as Ronan Lupton, Áine Lynch and Professor Joe Carthy. All the Ministers appeared before the committee for the final part of the sessions. Apparently, it was the first time that happened. The Minister, Deputy Zappone, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister for
Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, appeared before us. That showed a willingness to collaborate on the issue of cybersafety and protection of our children. The momentum to deal with this issue started in February 2017 and we concluded our hearings in February 2018. It was a year's solid work. We would say we worked hard but the clerk to the committee and her team worked very hard also in writing to people and compiling the report. We received many submissions. The content in terms of what was put before the committee was amazing. The media bought into our discussions and listened to them on a weekly basis, hence the Ministers came in behind us. The one element that kept coming through from the discussions was the question of a digital safety commissioner. The Minister and I had exchanges in the House during Question Time in recent days but a digital safety commissioner was an issue that continued to arise because there does not appear to be a proper level of governance or protection for our young people. Parents do not believe they are sufficiently equipped or educated because technology is changing so quickly in this area. They would appreciate having the short rule book on it because the children are ten steps ahead of us. One lesson I learned last summer was to do with the Snapchat locations setting. I had never heard of that. In fairness, one of the radio stations carried the story on Snapchat locations. Children were not allowed on Snapchat until they were 13 but the age has been increased to 16. This time last year, a child could be on Snapchat but a new application, locations, appeared on it. That means that if someone turned on the locations setting, people could identify their location. If they were being followed, groomed or profiled, the person doing that would know where they lived. My children came to visit in the Dáil one day. Aoíbhinn put on her Snapchat location setting so when she went out to Grafton Street, I could tell where she was and if I could trace her location, so could every one of her friends. The radio programme carried the story about the Snapchat locations setting and advised parents to have the conversation about it with their children and that it should be turned off. We also heard about another application that came out around last August, Sarahah, which was not the nicest one. On Snapchat children can talk to their friends but only negative and nasty commentary is put up on Sarahah. As a result of radio stations carrying the story, parents became aware of it. Many of them had the conversation with their children and were able to take down the site. While Instagram is great for posting beautiful pictures and so on, it might give young girls the wrong impression that they have to look a particular way or that their make-up should be perfect. It is exposing children too much and sexualising them far too early. Dr. Geoffrey Shannon made powerful statements to the committee. I believe he appeared before the Law Reform Commission before he appeared before our good selves. On the digital safety commissioner he stated:The proposed Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner of Ireland should oversee effective and efficient take down procedure in a timely manner, regulating for a system of take down orders in respect of harmful cybercommunication made in respect of both adults and children. I would also add that in the terms of the role of the Digital Safety Commissioner and take down procedures there should be a requirement on the Digital Safety Commissioner to take down material within a specified period of time. It is an issue that is not expressly referenced in the report of the Law Reform Commission...What we are talking about in that regard is children putting up inappropriate images on Instagram. They could take photographs of themselves or their friends and if they put them on the likes of Snapchat, one friend might like them and all of a sudden they would go to others. They could be then used as a form of bullying or for various other reasons. Also, if they are left in that sphere and they subsequently want to apply for a job or something like that, Dr. Shannon advised that they should take them down. Dr. Shannon also spoke about fights taking place that are put on YouTube. Some of them show young children fighting or being paid to fight in particular areas, and he wanted those images to be taken down.  The right to be forgotten was another of Dr. Shannon's key recommendations. If a child is under an age when the brain might not have developed to a particular level, he or she should have that right of protection and the right to be forgotten. Two groups of children appeared before the committee and while they were wonderful, I am glad we left them to the end of our discussions because if we had brought them to come in at the start, everything else would have been dull after their appearance. Two staff members man the office for Internet safety in the Department of Justice and Equality. They are tasked with Internet safety for the entire country but to be fair to the two ladies who appeared before the committee, they produced 40,000 booklets on Internet safety. Unfortunately, they do not produce enough of them. They should have one for every national and secondary school because the quality of the content is second to none. The only complaint I have about that is that not enough booklets are produced. They should be put into every national school and not in September but at Christmas time when Santy might bring the child a phone or at confirmation time. In that way the conversation about Internet safety can be had. The office for Internet safety has done a huge amount of work for which it deserves great credit. Representatives of An Garda Síochána appeared before us also. It has a team of 32 people working in the Phoenix Park headquarters. They discussed the amount of work they have to put in to deal with cyberbullying, profiling, grooming, sexting, what takes place in the underworld of the Internet and how cruel it can be to very young children. They explained that the most vulnerable are the most at risk.They work with agencies such as Interpol, our European colleagues and others. One of the concerns I have with Brexit moving forward is how our communications will continue in order to protect children. This report is amazing. The Minister is just one among many others but she is an Independent Alliance Minister in the Cabinet. I ask her to press for the action plan to come forward and also for the establishment of the digital safety commissioner. It is a must for our children.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-14 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	The safety and security of young people online is one of the most pressing child protection issues we are facing at this time. I welcome this report. It presents a thorough analysis of the issues of concern to the wider public, along with 18 recommendations which we hope will address those concerns. The Internet offers huge benefits to society through the sharing of information and in terms of communications for business and education. However, there are downsides. These range from the protection of personal information online to cyberbullying and child exploitation. A harsh light has been shone on some of the social media platforms, particularly Facebook, in recent months regarding the ability of third-party apps to harvest users' personal data. One of reasons many parents are so concerned about cybersecurity is that young people and children often have far better skills and knowledge of various apps, social media platforms and online services than they do. Parents often feel helpless and unable to keep up with the latest app or social media site. In a few short years the Internet has moved from a desktop computer to smartphones. This has increased parents' concerns because it is now more difficult to monitor children’s online activity. One of the main recommendations in this report is the establishment of an office of digital safety commissioner. I commend this. This is something for which Sinn Féin, along with Deputy Rabbitte and Fianna Fáil, has advocated for a long time. It has also been called for by the Law Reform Commission. In addition, the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, has fully endorsed it. I consider it a priority. One of the major issues for legislators when dealing with online safety and cybersecurity is that responsibility falls across many Departments. We need a one-stop shop. We need an office which young people, parents, industry and legislators can rely on to advise on best practice when it comes to digital safety. We all know that digital technology will continue to play an increasing role in the lives of young people. We must be sure that we have the tools to educate young people on how to use this technology in a respectful and safe way. I mentioned earlier that parents are often less savvy than their children in this area, so the education cannot be solely aimed at children. We must ensure that parents are educated and aware of the potential dangers children face when using these services. That is the reason I welcome many of the recommendations which deal with the need for education. The Internet, apps and social media play an increasing role in the lives of children and therefore it is vital that education on them is included in the school curriculum. Students must learn life skills as well as academic studies in school. I also wish to mention the role of social media platforms in this. The industry has to be aware of its obligations to safeguard users. Indeed, the GDPR regulations go some way towards dealing with the use personal data. While there is an onus on parents to monitor their children’s use of the Internet, there is also an onus on Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram and others to ensure that those who use their services are able to report a problem, whether it is bullying, inappropriate content or a list of other concerns, and that it will be dealt with swiftly. In the committee we have been very clear that it is not acceptable for these companies to wash their hands of such problems. Various representatives told the committee that they will take this issue seriously. We will keep an eye on them over the coming months. With regard to the Data Protection Bill and the digital age of consent, I particularly welcome one of the amendments that was proposed by my colleague, Deputy Ó Laoghaire, and passed. The amendment in question will protect children from profiling and micro-marketing while online. The amendment will restrict the profiling, harvesting and targeting of children and youths by companies that advertise on social media. This is not just about the nuisance advertisements that appear in the news feeds. Often advertisements targeted at young people are inappropriate and in some cases they are pushing certain agendas. The advertisements can be quite harmful to young people by making them very conscious of issues such as their appearance or body shape. In summary, I welcome this report. The proposals it contains are sensible. They are built on those made by the Internet content governance advisory group in 2014. It is a shame that some of those recommendations are still outstanding. They should be implemented without delay. This is a very complex issue, but it must be tackled. The Internet is not going away. It is something people grow up with and is part of life, so we must reflect that in how we approach it.

It would be remiss of me not to start by paying a big tribute to the eight women and three men on the committee, including Deputies Rabbitte and Mitchell, who have done an enormous amount of work. It is important that we get to work on implementing the 18 recommendations as quickly as possible, and I know the Minister will be very committed to that. Our children and teenagers are at risk from many unknowns in the digital era. Cyberbullying is more often than not a silent predator. Knowledge, communication and oversight are more important now than ever. One thing is certain - what goes online stays online forever. How many children and teenagers have been tormented, threatened, harassed, humiliated, embarrassed or otherwise targeted by another child or teenager using the Internet, interactive and digital technologies or mobile telephones? I commented a few days ago that the telephone was invented for people to speak to each other, but it is no longer used for that. As a politician, I must try to keep up with everything that is happening but every few months there is a new way of getting messages. One finds that one cannot keep up with all the messages. Somebody might say "I sent you a message on WhatsApp and you did not reply". There are so many outlets for getting information, even for us, that it is absolutely impossible to keep up. Research shows that probably 15% of primary school children are the victims of cyberbullying. It is probably almost the same for children in post-primary school.Those figures are constantly growing. We have to tackle the issue and be serious about it. There is a general acceptance across the political arena that it is urgent. The people who use technology to bully may say things online or by text that they would never say face to face. They need to know they are responsible for their words in cyberspace as well as in the real world. If it comes down to it, the source of the abuse, the computer or phone being used, can be identified by the Garda. I put together a newsletter with my staff and we circulated it. Of all the issues I have dealt with in my constituency, the huge response I got to this made me feel that it is probably the most important issue. In doing that research I found disturbing things. Many parents are afraid to tackle this issue. If their child is in the bedroom missing for half an hour, they know they are on the phone or some other device connected to the Internet. They are trying to balance not having a row with their child with still being responsible and making sure they know what is going on. They are afraid to set time limits or speak about it. In some cases they are allowing their children to dictate the pace. The one thing to come out of this is that parents must act strongly in this, be responsible and set the parameters. They need to get into a sensible conversation. It happens in our house. If somebody goes missing, we know where they are. It is important to say, "Hey, you've been at that for half an hour now, get out and kick a football or do something else." We need to engage them in a certain way. In restaurants, many people have social media items to entertain their children, which is shocking. There is no conversation and they are playing away on some little device. It may be safe enough because the parents are there to regulate or watch what is going on. Is it not shocking, even at mealtime, even when people go out for an hour or an hour and a half, that they end up trying to keep the children quiet? Sometimes when they are very young, of course, it might be hard to keep them quiet. As a way of entertaining them I just do not like it. We need to talk to parents about those types of things. We need to engage with everybody. I compliment everybody involved. I have no doubt that the Minister will do everything to get this matter sorted out as quickly as possible. I encourage parents, teenagers and everybody to engage in this. Some of the stuff that appears on Facebook is horrific. Even with comments about people in politics, business or communities, I cannot understand some of the appalling language and bitterness. I appeal from the Oireachtas this evening for all people doing this to take stock and stop it. It is bad for society.

It is appropriate and impressive that we have two members of the committee who put the report together and also a Deputy who is not a member of the committee. They have all demonstrated in-depth knowledge of the issues, and a genuine on the ground engagement with their constituents and their families, which will influence and impact the way the Government and the Oireachtas move together as a whole on this issue. They are very fine public representatives in this regard. It is very impressive to listen to them. It is not always the case that when a committee produces a report, that topic is taken up by the Department of the Taoiseach and it comes back to us here as an action plan. The committee's work was a catalyst to ensure that happened. That is very significant. Although the action plan that comes back may not contain a way of implementing all the recommendations the committee has suggested, I assure Members that I know it was used as a primary resource for that action plan. That is also very significant. I listened to the Deputies referring to some of the recommendations in the report as well as augmenting those recommendations with their own reflections since that time. I am sure the committee members will look at that plan using their expertise, taking a whole-of-Government approach, because that is what they did to produce the report. We could well use the committee members' wisdom, experience and analysis to respond to that action plan. In my earlier exchange with Deputy Rabbitte on the issue, I indicated my view on the recommendations of having a digital safety commissioner. I welcome that as a strong and good way forward. I understand that the action plan that is coming forward will focus on bringing together what is done, finding ways across Departments to streamline that, but also to offer some real additionality. The Government will work with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill introduced by Deputy Ó Laoghaire. Fianna Fáil has also advocated strongly for that. The Government did not oppose the Second Stage of that Bill. The action plan commits us to working on the Bill. There are many complexities in that regard. While that is going on with the Taoiseach's action plan, we will put in place some additional actions for which certain Departments will be responsible. That will mean that while we look for significant legislative change, we can move towards the implementation of certain actions within the relevant Departments that will be guided by many of the policy recommendations outlined in the committee's report. I am deeply grateful for that. I am proud that this has come from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, although the committee does not report to me. Rather, I report to it. The committee took on board that whole-of-Government approach. I well remember the day that I was there with my other Government colleagues. It is not very often that four different Ministers appear before a committee to answer to the committee, say what we are doing and listen to the committee members' analysis in light of the evidence they collected in preparing the report. The Government will continue to play its full part in working in a cross-Government way, especially working with the committee in moving this significant issue forward and beginning to implement new actions relatively soon in light of the committee's influence in getting the Department of the Taoiseach to put in place an action plan on the issue.
