#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Many here will have learnt with some sadness of the death of the former Deputy, Senator and councillor, Bernard Markey. His passing during the summer was certainly felt by all in Fine Gael. He was born in 1935 and was a man deeply and passionately connected with his people and his constituency. He fought their case and represented their cause with determination and conviction. He served on a number of occasions for Monaghan constituency when it was joined with Louth. The people of Louth, Ardee in particular, knew that in Bernard Markey they had a real champion. One of the reasons he represented them so well was that he genuinely believed in the power of politics and its ability to effect real change for the better in the lives of ordinary people.I had the pleasure of serving in the House with Bernard Markey as a member of the Fine Gael parliamentary party. I remember that his deep disappointment on narrowly losing his Dáil seat in 1982 was tempered by the knowledge that he would go on to serve his community at both Seanad and council level. He was a passionate follower of the Gaelic Athletic Association and was a player and member of St. Mary's GAA club in Ardee. For those Members who would not have known Bernard Markey, long before Deputy Gregory arrived here without his tie and at a time of sartorial conservatism, he epitomised what it was to be cool by having his own particular style of leather jacket and open-necked shirt at Fine Gael parliamentary party meetings, which were often far from cool in those days.On behalf of the House and the Fine Gael party I express my deepest sympathy to his wife Anne, his daughter Tara and the members of his extended family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I am pleased to have the opportunity to join with the leader of Fine Gael in the  expression of sympathy to the Markey family on the death of Bernard Markey. As Deputy Kenny said, Bernard Markey was a member of both Dáil and Seanad Éireann. He was a long-time member of Louth County Council and I was honoured to be his colleague for many years on that body.Bernard Markey was a man of intellect and perception whose input to debate, both here and at county council level, was always incisive and constructive. He was a member of an old Ardee family. Both he and other members of his family displayed considerable academic and public administrative capabilities. His family was very involved in the sporting arena in County Louth and both he and his brother Pat were playing members of the Ardee St. Mary's and the County Louth teams during a successful period in the 1940s and 1950s.I extend my sympathy to Anne, his daughter Tara, his son-in-law Albert, and his brothers.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	2	On behalf of the Labour Party, I join the leader of Fine Gael and Deputy Kirk in offering our condolences to the family of Bernard Markey. He preceded me in the House and, therefore, I did not know him other than by reputation as a respected Member of the House and a diligent representative of his constituents. I extend our sympathies to the Fine Gael Party and to his wife and daughter.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	On my own behalf and that of the Progressive Democrats Party and the Government, I extend my sympathies to the family of the late Bernard Markey. I was a Member of the House for a short time while he was a Member and remember him as a friendly, warm gentleman. He had an exceptionally pleasant easy-going personality. I do not recall the leather jacket which was referred to, although he may have confined wearing it to Fine Gael parliamentary party meetings.As other Deputies said, he represented the people of Ardee on Louth County Council and those of Louth during his period in this House, which he served with great distinction. It is sad that his life came to such a sudden end – he was only in his 60s when he died during the summer.

He was a committed councillor, Senator and Deputy and was responsible for much new thinking in Fine Gael. He was of the liberal tradition in Fine Gael and it was he who first asked me to join Fine Gael. I worked with him during the general election campaign and on Louth County Council where, as Deputy Kirk said, he made a significant contribution to every debate. He was leader of  the Fine Gael group on the county council and was a dedicated and committed politician who gave great service and all of his time to the people of the community, particularly in Ardee.While canvassing in the more remote parts of west County Louth, which Deputy Kirk knows best, I discovered that the people there knew Bernard Markey extremely well. He covered the entire constituency and visited its most remote parts to provide an excellent and first class service as a Deputy and public representative.
Members rose.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Given that there is such disarray in the Cabinet and within the ranks of the Progressive Democrats Party on the issue of the deal, I am concerned that there could be problems with this Bill.

This matter has been the subject of Leaders' Questions on a number of occasions this week. There was a full day of debate and questions on it yesterday, it is before the Public Accounts Committee this morning and there is a question to the Minister for Education and Science this afternoon.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Minister for Education and Science has indicated that it will be the spring of next year before the legislation is ready. He must wait for the independent review, which is being conducted by Mr. Seán Ryan SC, and the outcome of the Christian Brothers case which is before the courts.

This issue has been debated for practically all of the past two days, is before a committee of the House this morning and will be raised during Question Time this afternoon. Has the Deputy another question?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I understand that the Minister of State at the Tánaiste's Department responsible for the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Carcinogens Regulation) Bill, dealing with enviromental tobacco smoke and so on, is Deputy Fahey, who has apparently come out against the ban on smoking.
#NoelDavern	unknown-#NoelDavern-party	unknown-#NoelDavern-dob	unknown-#NoelDavern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Has the Deputy ever heard of social smoking?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Will the brief be left with the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will Deputy Davern take it over or perhaps the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Does that mean the Minister of State will remain in his post?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18463	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Where stand the Government's proposals for Dáil reform? We must have the opportunity to address the issues which have been raised by the leaders of all parties this morning because they are key to political accountability. In the context of Dáil reform, will there be a different process in the House this year for the presentation and debating of the Estimates, given that the Tánaiste has long been against the inadequacy of the examination of Estimates? Will the Government bring forward a more meaningful process for debating the Estimates before they are half spent, as has been the case for some years.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I understand we were to discuss this matter last evening. I support the Deputy's suggestions in regard to the Estimates. It would be more meaningful for Ministers as well as Deputies if the Estimates could be discussed earlier. I am sure suggestions forthcoming from the Whips' meeting will be taken on board.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18463	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	36	They should be discussed—

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18463	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	38	On a point of order, is it not a matter for the Government to order this sort of arrangement rather than the Whips?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	39	That is not a point of order.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18463	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The Tánaiste seeks to deny responsibility for answering on this issue, yet she has a responsibility to do so. Therefore, it is a point of order since it has to do with the way in which questions which are legitimately raised on the Order of Business are handled. They cannot be transferred to the Whips as if they are a matter for them.

Leaders of the main parties raised an issue which causes some difficulties. I will not pursue the matter if the Ceann Comhairle thinks I am not in order. A few days ago in the House the Taoiseach replied in relation to the child abuse issue—

He can raise the issue by way of substantive motion but he cannot raise it on the Order of Business.

I do not see reference to planning legislation. The Taoiseach promised a change in the planning laws at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting in Sligo in relation to one-off housing. The European Union has found this country to be in breach of European law by charging people €20 to write to their county council about a planning matter which would require a change in the law. Does the Government not intend to introduce any planning legislation?

I am asking the Tánaiste in which of the three sections of the list it should be included.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I suggest the Deputy should submit a question to the Minister.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I welcome the Bill, which arises out of the report of the commission on the private rented sector. Widespread consultation took  place regarding the formulation of the Bill, which aims to ensure tenants are treated fairly. I hope the legislation has a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Housing is a major issue. High levels of economic growth have resulted in both the return of emigrants and immigration while growth in the population generally has led to an increased demand for housing. This combined with low interest rates has ensured house prices have increased substantially.Major efforts have been made, therefore, to increase the supply of housing. Approximately 57,000 units have been constructed annually for the past few years and this has helped. The Government has rightly prioritised social and affordable housing. Local authorities and voluntary and co-operative housing organisations continue to provide first class accommodation. Groups such as Respond, Hail, Summit, Aoibhneas and NABCO have constructed fine housing schemes and tenants have fully integrated into the local community.The aspiration to home ownership is important in our society and that is positive. The State helps those on lower incomes to achieve home ownership through the affordable housing and shared ownership loan schemes. However, these schemes should be constantly reviewed. The high price of housing in Dublin has meant the shared ownership loan scheme has not been as successful as expected and that is appreciated by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern. In addition, progress on the supply of affordable housing units has been slow in my constituency, for example, but there are signs of an improvement in this regard. Many young couples are not sufficiently aware of these schemes and the Department and local authorities should do more to publicise the help that is available for those who need it.The Bill confirms the Government's view that a stable rental sector is a vital part of the housing market. A sufficient supply of rented accommodation is important generally. While the measures taken on foot of the Bacon reports to take the investor out of the housing market in recent years might have led to a temporary improvement for first-time buyers, it worsened the position of those in the private rented sector, as evidenced by a shortage in supply and escalating rents. Escalating rents resulted in significant payments in rent supplements by health boards at a major cost to the taxpayer. Thankfully, rent increases have moderated and balance has been restored to the market. The question arises as to whether Government can buck the market trend. It does not look like it, on the basis of our recent experience in this regard, but I suggest that is a question for another day.It is generally accepted that the percentage of the Irish population living in rented accommodation is out of sync with the rest of Europe. That is likely to change, however, despite our attach ment to home ownership. It is likely that renting will become a real medium to long-term option. Tenants deserve more rights, therefore, and such rights are being provided in this Bill. The law has tended to favour the property rights of landlords, but this Bill will bring about a balance in that regard.Part 2 of the Bill deals with the tenancy obligations of landlords and tenants. The maintenance of rented accommodation by landlords has been an issue for my constituents in the past. This Bill imposes an explicit requirement on landlords to maintain the structure and the interior of a rented property to the standard that applied at the commencement of the letting. I hope this will work in practice. The housing regulations in this regard did not work as expected in the past. Tenants felt unable, for many reasons, to report landlords to local authorities and environmental health officers in many cases. It is clear for all to see that the difficulties in obtaining private rented accommodation, in the first instance, mean that a tenant is unlikely to go to an environmental health officer to report inadequate conditions. Tenants are likely to bring many problems on themselves if they decide to make such a report. Enforcement of regulations and standards was also an issue when there were inadequate staff levels at local authority level. All Deputies who are honest will say they are aware of poor quality rented accommodation in their constituencies. I hope this Bill's provisions will bring about change in that regard for once and for all.Part 2 of the Bill obliges tenants not to engage in anti-social behaviour. This is an important initiative, as such behaviour by tenants in private rented accommodation is a real problem in many housing estates. My experience indicates that young people, in particular, are sometimes involved in drunken behaviour, playing loud music and all-night partying. I do not suggest that such behaviour is exclusively confined to young people, such as students who are renting accommodation. The complaints I receive often relate to such people, however. As a public representative, I often feel helpless in tackling such problems when they are brought to my attention by neighbours. I may be unable to track down the landlord in question. When I am able to contact a landlord, he or she is often unwilling to respond to a letter highlighting a problem. The Garda Síochána can be contacted, but gardaí often have enough to do. The Garda does not have enough legal provisions at its disposal to deal with the problems I have mentioned. The enforcement of laws relating to noise pollution, for example, may involve contacting the noise control unit of a local authority or the EPA. None of the solutions I have mentioned has worked in the past, but I hope this Bill's provisions will help to tackle this big problem in our communities.Part 7 of the Bill relates to the registration of tenancies. New registration requirements will replace the 1996 registration regulations. There have been real problems in the past in getting  landlords to register with local authorities. I do not have the relevant statistics, but my experience suggests that as few as 20% of landlords registered in the past. I appreciate that certain court cases have not helped this problem, but I believe the time has come to make an all-out effort to enforce the law, to ensure that landlords are registered with local authorities and to ensure that this Bill is implemented in full. I hope the Bill will lead to improvements. There has been no enforcement of the registration laws. There is a great deal of private rented accommodation in the district of Fairview in Dublin 3, which is in my constituency. My experience is that when one tries to determine whether certain properties are registered, one is invariably told that they are not. I hope the Bill will deal with the real problem that exists in this regard. I would welcome the Minister's views on the enforcement of the new provisions.Landlords who have contacted me about this legislation have raised concerns about its provisions in respect of security of tenure, which are contained in Part 4. Security of tenure is provided for in the Bill on the basis of four-year cycles. Tenancies will be deemed terminated at the end of each four-year period, when a new tenancy will come into being, assuming the dwelling continues to be let to the same person or persons. A landlord will be free to terminate a tenancy without giving a reason in the first six months of a tenancy. Termination will only be possible in the remaining three and a half years where one of the grounds specified in the Bill applies. These grounds include failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations, the proposed sale of the dwelling, the proposed occupation of the dwelling by the owner or a family member, a proposed change in the use of the dwelling or the proposed major renovation of the dwelling. The proposed permissible reasons for the termination of a tenancy are quite extensive and flexible.I have said to landlords who have contacted me about the provisions in respect of security of tenure that I consider the provisions to be reasonable and fair. Various groups and organisations representing property owners have circulated misinformation. When I explain the provisions to property owners they accept that they are fair and balanced and are generally satisfied with the Bill.Public representatives, particularly in the Dublin area, need to be conscious of the strategic planning guidelines for high density developments. Planning applications are being made for high density, and often poor quality, apartment developments. It has been my experience that this has the potential to destroy some of our traditional neighbourhoods. Very often a planning application will involve the destruction of an old house and its replacement with a huge apartment block, which may be of poor quality. Many of the units in these apartment blocks are rented, although my concern does not arise from this fact. We need to plan our areas properly and not  destroy old traditional neighbourhoods. Where we give permission for such developments we must be conscious of the areas in which they are taking place, be very selective and ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place. This issue is of concern to my constituents and local planning authorities must be conscious of it in the future.The Bill provides for the legislative reforms of the private rented sector recommended by the Commission on the Private Rented Sector, which published its report in July 2000. The Bill has been a long time in the pipeline. However, I accept that the Minister and the Department needed to consult widely on the report as published. I am happy that the Government is implementing the recommendations of the commission and this Bill is another step in that process.Various groups and organisations have lobbied on the Bill. Lobbying has taken place on behalf of property owners and of Threshold, which works in the interest of tenants. I pay tribute to Threshold for the great work it does in preparing policies for the private rented sector and in giving practical help to tenants who are faced with pressing problems concerning notices to quit or evictions and who are not familiar with the law. Threshold provides a first class service and deserves Government support, particularly financial support.The Bill introduces a significant measure of security of tenure for tenants. It specifies minimum obligations applying to landlords and tenants and provides for the establishment of a private residential tenancies board to resolve disputes arising in this sector. I welcome the establishment of the private residential tenancies board. It will have a big workload and will provide a useful and invaluable service. The Bill which is overdue will revolutionise the private rented sector and is extremely welcome.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation, which emanates from the proposals of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector. The commission made its recommendations as long ago as July 2000. If anything epitomises the lethargy and failure of the Government it is its tardiness in bringing forward this important legislation. All public representatives know how important this legislation is. We know that many people have been living in sub-standard accommodation.I welcome the requirement that landlords register lettings. I agree with Deputy Haughey that the percentage of landlords who register is low. The 1996 regulations imposed a registration charge of €40 but only an infinitesimal number registered. The registration fee could have been  a source of revenue for local authorities to enable them to carry out their statutory duty to provide accommodation for the thousands of young people who cannot afford to own their own home. The enforcement by local authorities of the requirement to register has left much to be desired. I hope the board will tackle this problem with strength and vigour and that the full rigour of the law will be brought to bear on landlords who fail to register. This is an important protection for people who are obliged to pay exorbitant rents.I will return later to the question of rents. Some of the rent provisions are reasonable. However, as Labour Party spokesperson for social and family affairs I am aware of an inherent contradiction between what is set out in the Bill and the capping of rent allowances. I will offer constructive criticism and advice and I hope the Minister will take cognisance of it and accept it in the spirit in which it is offered.In the late 1950s my family was lucky to secure a local authority house. It has been the ethos of the Labour Party to ensure that people have a decent house. In our periods of government we always tried to provide the maximum number of local authority houses because we are committed to doing so. Failure to provide the necessary local authority accommodation is an indictment of the Government.No subject can more accurately encapsulate the dilemma of the Celtic tiger than that of housing. Paradoxically, as we got richer the ability of people to secure their own homes declined. We have to focus on housing as an instrument of social policy. Some will say we focus on it in different ways and that is why the Labour Party has a very different view on this matter from that held by others at the centre right in terms of their political philosophy. If we have to pay a little extra tax to ensure the less well-off have the opportunity to have a decent roof over their heads, so be it. Ultimately, if the common good is to be anything other than a constitutional aspiration, we have an obligation to provide the necessary shelter and accommodation for the 6,000 or 7,000 homeless people lying in doorways in various towns and cities. This level of homelessness is an indictment of us all. It is not easy to address but we must tackle it in a meaningful and positive way.The aspiration of owning one's house or having access to public housing of a decent or high quality has become a far-fetched dream for many young people. Under the PPF the unions secured a commitment to provide 25,000 houses. Under Sustaining Progress, I believe there was a commitment to provide a further 10,000 units of affordable housing. These are very laudable commitments and they give people heart. It is easy for us to crib and in a time of restricted resources the Minister might say these commitments are the best the Government can make, but only 13,000 local authority houses were completed between 1999 and 2002. That is only slightly over half the  number the Government committed itself to providing.The Minister might say that the Government has introduced certain measures to address the problem, but the changes made in the affordable housing area at the end of 2002 emasculated him in terms of his ability to provide affordable housing because the amending legislation regarding the environment served as a capitulation to house builders and developers. We should be clear about that. They won the battle.The social housing budget decreased last year by 5%. When all such factors are considered, it is no wonder that the queues for housing are forever growing longer. In my constituency, which is at a good remove of 60 miles from Dublin, a couple with two reasonable jobs can no longer afford to purchase a house. Such people, when growing up as children, would have aspired to owning one. The Minister may retort that we are hung up on house ownership in Ireland and that ownership is not the key issue abroad. The key issue abroad is accommodation with rights to ensure people are not turfed out at the whim of individuals and that proper leasing structures are in place to protect them from this. However, our Constitution establishes a very strong, fundamental base in respect of property rights. We subscribe to the philosophy that what we have we hold.In the early 1990s we were building about 20,000 new houses per year but we needed to build about 50,000 to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand. The Minister might argue that the Government maintained inflation at a reasonably low level in the longer term. It did, although we argue that it contributed to inflation in the past 12 months. However, let us consider building inflation and the associated costs. The Minister and I will probably disagree regarding the cost of building land, which is central to the problem of escalating house prices. We should be clear that this is a sine qua non of the cost of housing.If one examines the industrial building index pertaining to the early 1990s, just prior to the boom, the cost of a site contributed to about 14% or 15% of the cost of a house. Now this figure has increased to approximately 40% and is increasing towards 50% in Dublin. This is because a few people monopolise and control land banks. It is a speculators' charter. They release the land into the market in such a way that demand is always greater than supply and therefore they win.Capital gains tax was decreased. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made great play of this and he had an argument for doing so. However, it did not do much for the holders of Eircom shares because they all lost out, but that is another matter. The very reason the Minister argued – it was a reasonable argument – in favour of decreasing capital gains tax from 40% to 20% was so the owners of the land banks would release their land and halve their capital gains tax liability, thus resulting in lower prices for our siblings. This never happened and the opposite  occurred. The owners of the land banks became greedier and this is why the Minister must take action.One cannot leave the market unregulated and this is why my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, will introduce relevant legislation at the first available opportunity. The free market in this case has afforded absolutely no favourable opportunity to house buyers. If the Constitution means anything when referring to the common good, we should not be afraid to try to help people who cannot afford housing. This is what we are about as legislators.The Kenny report has provided the backbone of our argument and I realise the Taoiseach said the problem needs to be addressed. The report gave us something to play on. As a lawyer, I believe we have something to work with and we can introduce measures that are consistent with the Constitution. Capping the price of building land will be important in ensuring that ordinary people are afforded an opportunity to secure a dwelling house.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	141	It is with a sense of déjà vu that we consider the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003. Those who remember their history classes at second level will recall the agitation that took place throughout the country in the 19th century regarding fair rent and security of tenure in terms of land. This mirrors present circumstances when we consider the laws that apply to private rented accommodation in urban settings in particular. We still live largely in a Victorian era. There is no fair rent or fixity of tenure. Anybody can be evicted with 28 days notice – families, children, etc. – without any comeback. There is no regulation in this respect and measures with which to deal with this are long overdue. We are the last country in the European Union to introduce them. The small measures in the Bill are certainly welcome and I would like to see us go a lot further in terms of the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector. It is a shame that it has taken us so long to get this far.One of the major issues that concerns me in recent years is the failure of local authorities to register landlords. When we introduced the legislation in the mid-1990s we had expected that all landlords would register, as they are obliged to do by law. We gave the local authorities the responsibility to register them. The registration was to be self-financing because the local authorities were entitled at the time to impose a levy of £40 per unit of accommodation. They simply did not exercise their duty regarding the implementation of the law. Approximately 80% of the landlords in this city are not registered, therefore we do not know the quality of accommodation in use or whether those people are paying tax. It means that a valuable source of income to local authorities has been foregone.Local authorities throughout the country have behaved scandalously on this issue. It compares poorly with the alacrity with which they began to implement the legislation on waste management, when action was taken scarcely a month after the ministerial order was signed. A politician from this House was sent to prison for a month, yet in a display of double standards, local authorities have made no effort to implement the existing legislation in this area which, over the past eight or nine years, would have provided them with a revenue stream. They have failed to collect the levy from landlords and to ensure they were registered and compliant with the law. I never thought I would say I am glad that under this legislation, the function will be removed from the local authorities and given to the Private Residential Tenancy Board to ensure that registration takes place. It must be ensured that the board has adequate resources and personnel to enable it fulfil its mandate on a nationwide basis.I have always been in favour of landlordism being considered as a commercial business. Landlords are in the business for profit. Their activities should be run like a business, which should be well regulated according to best practice and with high standards prevailing. Every unit of accommodation should be amenable to the Revenue Commissioners, another aspect of where the law has been more honoured in the breach than the implementation. I hope the requirement to register with the new board will ensure that those involved in this business will be tax compliant.Another valuable stream of income could accrue to local authorities if landlordism was recognised as a commercial business subject to the imposition of a commercial rate, in the same way as retail outlets or businesses. Why should it not be regarded as a commercial business and why should a rate not be struck to cover landlords throughout this city who, at present, pay nothing to the local authorities even when these provide services that benefit them in the conduct of their business? An amendment to the Valuation Acts should be introduced that will allow for a valuation on a commercial basis of landlord accommodation to ensure they make a contribution to their local authorities and the running of the various urban areas in which they operate. Such a revenue stream would be far in excess of what is expected to accrue from the waste management charges applying in Dublin city. If the same tough action was taken against non-compliant landlords who have not bothered to obey the law and register their activity as has been applied in the area of waste collection, it would not be long before a couple of them were imprisoned and they all obeyed the law. The local authorities should be far more active in ensuring this happens.I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Haughey about some of the developments in the city and that an element of ghettoisation could result because some accommodation was built to inadequate standards. There has been tremendous developments in what were previously der elict areas in the city, much of it in my constituency and that of Deputy Eoin Ryan. However, the area integrated development plans, which allow for planned development, have not been granted planning authority. By contrast, the Dublin docklands comprises the only area in the city which, under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, has a planning authority dealing with development. The authority has the responsibility to draw up a master plan for the development of the area and the authority to grant planning permission, giving it equal powers to the local authorities. The same powers should have been granted in terms of the integrated area plans on the north and south sides of the city. This would have ensured control over developments. There is now a danger of over-development in certain areas, where some of the residential accommodation, with units comprising of one or two bedrooms, have been built to inadequate standards. There is a danger that accommodation will be constantly mobile with the result that people will not set down roots in their local communities, which is a cause of major concern.I welcome the legislation, especially those provisions dealing with securing a market and a fair rent and the establishment of security of tenure. I hope the probationary period will be reduced and that a second such period will not be necessary after the first four years have elapsed. The legislation is long overdue and it should be fully implemented as quickly as possible.

#EoinRyan	unknown-#EoinRyan-party	unknown-#EoinRyan-dob	unknown-#EoinRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue. It should have been enacted a number of years ago. Nevertheless, I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing it before the House. Deputy Penrose referred to the price of houses and land. All public representatives are concerned about rising house prices. A few years ago, nobody would have foreseen the scale of the increases that have taken place. Many reports and initiatives, such as the Bacon report, have been produced in an attempt to restrict price increases but, unfortunately, they have not worked.While I would like to think the Labour Party's views are correct, the reality is that there is no simple solution to this problem. Although more houses per head of population are being built here than is the case in other European countries, supply is not meeting demand. Unfortunately, until a balance is reached between demand and supply, prices will continue to rise. A recent television programme dealt with the housing market in England which, while is has not slumped has levelled off. All the experts on the programme said that prices will only rise again when the first-time buyers return to the market. By contrast, in Ireland the huge demand by first-time buyers  continues to push up prices at the lower end of the market with the inevitable ripple effect upwards. Members from all sides of the House would enact whatever legislation or measures they considered necessary if they thought it would result in a stabilisation of prices, but unfortunately the demand is too high. That the pressure still exists is a demonstration of the buoyancy and strength of the economy. It is a serious problem, especially for first-time buyers, and needs to be addressed. It is to be hoped that, once supply meets demand, we will begin to see that turn around.The Bill is long overdue. I represent Dublin South-East which has had a long tradition of rented accommodation. Rathmines and other parts of the constituency were famous for many years for rented accommodation. Fortunately much of the old period houses that were full of bed sits have reverted to single occupier ownership and modern accommodation of superior quality is available for tenants. That must be welcomed. Obviously not all the old-style accommodation has been removed and some people still live in poor conditions, but accommodation overall has improved.Many complaints are made to the effect that people buy this new accommodation to rent it out and avail of the tax relief attached to it with the result that those who wish to buy it to live in it cannot afford it. The fact is that Dublin has grown as a city and its needs have changed. There is a larger transient population and good modern accommodation is needed for it. Many of these new apartments have met a demand. People should not criticise that fact. It is good to have such modern accommodation in the city.That said, one of the downsides to the Celtic tiger which I witnessed in my constituency was the appalling rent increases some people in the private rented sector had to bear in recent years. Rents were increased willy nilly and some increases were incredible. I complained publicly at the time and am glad to see that rents have levelled off and, in some cases, are beginning to decline because, in certain parts of my constituency, it is not as easy to let out accommodation as before. It is good that rents have stabilised and I hope that they will decline to make accommodation more accessible to people trying to rent privately.One of the reasons I welcome the Bill is the security of tenure it provides. My constituency is not unique in the fact that it has elderly people living in it, but I understand it has the highest proportion of them. They have been especially badly hit with rent increases. They are on a fixed income in the form of a pension, and some were living in apartments or flats for a number of years when rents went sky high.Everyone remembers what happened in the Mespil flats. People had lovely apartments and had security of tenure because Irish Life owned the accommodation. It sold it off suddenly and the tenants were subject to the market rate for  rents. Deputy Quinn, the former Deputy, Frances Fitzgerald, Deputy Michael McDowell, now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and I established a scheme with Irish Life to try to protect some of the elderly tenants. It worked to a certain degree in that it assisted them with these huge rent increases. We had to twist the arm of Irish Life to get it to do it but, in fairness, it put in place a pool of money to minimise the strain the rent increases had on the budget of these elderly people.The legislation is important because of what it does in the area of rent or rent reviews. I am delighted to see that there is a hold on these which means that, if we ever return to a time when rents increase dramatically and suddenly, there will be some type of break on it and people will not have to pay hundreds of euro extra per month to landlords.This legislation is long overdue. It will go a long way towards giving security, especially to older people who are vulnerable. They are on a fixed income in the form of a pension and need to be shown respect and feel secure in their homes. Not all of them can obtain local authority accommodation which means they need security. It is important, therefore, that we go out of our way to ensure that rent and rent reviews are controlled and that elderly people can appeal to an independent body to ensure their rent does not increase suddenly.I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House. I welcome it and, when it is in place, it can be strengthened in future as we see fit. It is a good beginning. I would like to see the introduction here of a concierge who lives in an apartment block and ensures it is run properly and that there is no anti-social behaviour. They exist in other European cities. Many of the problems, as Deputy Haughey said, arise from the fact that no one knows the landlord and anything can happen in apartments. This results in people living in poor conditions with a great deal of anti-social behaviour. It is unacceptable.This Bill is good legislation for tenants and landlords. There are occasions when landlords are badly treated by tenants. They do not happen anywhere near as often as the occasions when tenants are badly treated by landlords, but they happen. The Bill gives powers and a mechanism to landlords to make an appeal to try to improve the behaviour of their tenants. That must be welcomed. Some landlords have been misled about the contents of the legislation, as Deputy Haughey said, but most will welcome it because it places on a statutory footing the regulation of this market and gives security for tenants and landlords.
#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	145	It is imperative that I declare an interest as a landlord of some properties. As a landlord, I welcome the Bill because it gives an opportunity to implement the report on the private rented sector. This is a sector that has for  some time been a source of problems, mainly for tenants but also for landlords. In many cases, as Deputy Eoin Ryan said, tenants found that rents increased, in some cases on a monthly basis. That was terrible. They also had a problem with fixity of tenure. This is dealt with in the report.Some previous speakers referred to the Bacon report. That did untold damage to the private rented sector, especially in Dublin. Many involved in the business left the market. Had some of the Bacon report recommendations continued in force, it would have resulted in rents for accommodation in Dublin being twice what they are today.Thankfully, changes introduced by the Minister in recent years have resulted in many of those who had left the rental market to invest abroad returning to the market. This benefits tenants and the wider population of Dublin.The right of tenants to protection is generally accepted. Fixity of tenure is a very old concept in Ireland. Many people in rural areas fought for it to be introduced for land. There should be no difference with regard to the roof over one's head.It is a sad fact that many people will never be able to aspire to own accommodation. Whether by choice or due to economic circumstances, such people will be forced to remain in the rental sector. However, many people now believe that investing in a house is not as wise as it may appear and, rather than entering the housing market, would consider renting accommodation provided it is on a long-term secure basis. This would give them more disposable cash and allow them to lead a different lifestyle. Many have already made this choice and more will do so in the future. I wonder which group, tenants or buyers, will be proved right. This legislation helps to protect those who want to remain long-term tenants.The Bill defines the rights of landlords which is important in light of the many horror stories about tenants who have damaged accommodation or left it in a shambles. Equally, however, it is unacceptable that certain landlords expect people to live in squalor. Local authorities should carry out an annual inspection of all rental accommodation, paid for by the registration fees they receive from landlords. This would help maintain standards and benefit everyone involved in the sector.Students trying to rent accommodation in cities and towns with universities or third level institutions are another group which has faced major problems. They have often ended up living in extremely cramped conditions, which were detrimental to their person and their education. Recent decisions by the Government on funding and tax breaks for student rental accommodation are welcome. Landlords providing student accommodation do not have a right to impose on student tenants excessive restrictions or conditions, for example, in the area of down payments, which has been a problem in some cases.The situation as regards local authority housing has been helped by the rural renewal scheme, particularly in the region in which I live. The scheme has encouraged people to invest in rural areas and resulted in a substantial increase in rental accommodation. Deputy Crawford is envious of what we have in County Leitrim. In Carrick-on-Shannon, for instance, many of the people who work in companies such as MBNA and Masonite Ireland would not have been able to find accommodation without the incentives available for investing in rental accommodation. While it could be argued that some of the tax breaks introduced in recent years have not been in the best interests of rural communities, this is not the case with regard to the rural renewal scheme.People trying to provide for their accommodation needs in rural areas have encountered problems as a result of objections to one-off housing. Building a house in a rural area is often the only way to get on the property ladder. In many cases, outside groups and individuals have objected to one-off housing which is often wrong. Many of the objectors are people who have no significant involvement in the local community. Some of them have come to the local community from outside and decided they want the local area to be kept like a national park, while others have even suggested rural Ireland should be free of one-off housing. One should have the right to live wherever one wants within reason. In particular, anybody employed in an area or with family living in it should be entitled to receive planning permission, provided he or she does not want to erect a monstrosity, build on a corner or do something out of sync with the community in which he or she wishes to live.This Bill is necessary and has been a long time coming. It will offer tenants and landlords an opportunity to settle disputes in a much more orderly fashion and will ensure they no longer have to incur the extreme expense of litigation when disputes arise. The absence of guidelines has been a bone of contention for both tenants and landlords for some time. If one had a problem tenant or landlord, one ended up having to bring a case before the courts, which is not a cheap option, particularly for tenants, many of whom do not have the resources needed to defend their rights. The Bill will give such people an opportunity to defend their rights without having to incur enormous costs.The proposed private residential tenancies board will be busy in its early days, but I expect its workload will gradually reduce. People will realise it is a new forum for arbitration and settling tenancy disputes between tenants and landlords.We have all been elected to protect the rights of each individual citizen, including tenants and landlords. I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill which will help create a more organised rental sector. I hope changes made with regard to taxation will never again lead to people  leaving the accommodation market, as occurred following some of the decisions taken on foot of the Bacon reports. The recent return to the market of investors is helping to stabilise rents and make rental accommodation more affordable.

This is not inevitable. I reject the widespread belief that if one does not own one's home or is not part of the property owning class, one is not a fully paid up citizen, is unfortunate or in a terrible position. This focus on property ownership is absent in many other countries and was absent even here in the past. The great red brick houses which have sold for millions in recent years were largely rented in the past. There is nothing in our human psyche to indicate we have to own a house and nothing wrong with people deciding to rent instead of buying. It is important we get this message across.The reason the rented sector has such a poor image and tenants are experiencing such difficulty is that we, in this House, have legislated consistently in favour of the property owner as opposed to the tenant. I welcome the Bill inasmuch as it marks the beginning of efforts to redress this imbalance by recognising the rights of tenants as well as property owners.We tend to assume that property prices will continue to rise forever and that once one owns a house one is in nirvana and will relentlessly climb a ladder of wealth accumulation. This assumption may be proved wrong and the market may catch many people out. I hope tenancy, renting in the private sector, will come to be regarded as the intelligent, clever option. We should work towards this goal and give people a range of options as to how they lead their lives. We should also provide protection to people in tenancy arrangements, some of whom are in difficult circumstances.I welcome the main provisions of the Bill but I agree with Deputy Eoin Ryan that security of tenure is one of the key issues. We are seeking to provide rights for tenants and the key area in which that must be done and in which tenants must be protected is with regard to security of tenure. Unfortunately, the solution arrived at in this Bill does not provide proper rights and, in a way, will not work. It will lead to a mire of confusion and possibly litigation, despite what Deputy Ellis said.Section 34 sets out the grounds for breaking a Part 4 tenancy agreement. The landlord can break the contract where a member of his family might wish to move into the property or if he is thinking of selling the property. That is a large  loophole which a landlord who is seeking to break an agreement will use with consummate ease. The Minister should give serious consideration to that section and to amendments that might be put forward to strengthen the provisions and ensure the tenant is given further protection in this area. A landlord could drive a coach and four through that section.

Why do we wish to provide security of tenure? The problem is that the tenant has no protection.

I cannot see where it provides that the tenant can come back in three or six months and see that the property is sold. That is where the Bill requires strengthening. I will discuss later how that might be done.The Green Party made a submission containing an alternative solution. While I hope the Minister will be able to amend the Bill as I have suggested, he might not be willing to accept the suggestion I am about to make although it would be a more intelligent solution. We should not set a limit of four years. It is an arbitrary period. One is providing that after that period the security of tenure no longer applies and that the tenant is back at the starting blocks again. That is not security of tenure, it is a four year contract that does not provide proper long-term security.I prefer a solution whereby a tenant is given a right of security of tenure in proportion to the length of time they have the tenancy agreement. One could provide, for example, that for every year in tenancy occupancy, one would be entitled by law to eight weeks notice. That means an entitlement to eight weeks security of tenure in terms of notice. If the tenant is in occupancy for six months, only four weeks notice would be required. Both the tenant and the landlord would have to give the same notice. The obligation would be the same on either side because it is important that there is balance. We need to encourage people to provide good quality private rented accommodation. My suggestion would give the landlord security as well. He or she would know that they would be paid rent for a certain period of time. The Minister could provide for a longer or shorter period than eight  weeks, depending on how much security of tenure he wishes to supply.If somebody is in the same tenancy for ten years, he or she will get eight weeks notice for each of the years. Many people are in that position and they deserve that length of notice. One cannot turf out a tenant who has been in an apartment for ten years. Let us say the tenant has been in the property for eight years and is coming to the end of his or her second four year contract. We cannot tell the person that the landlord can evict him or her within a month or give one month's notice. That is unjust. It would be preferable to give—

Somebody in a property for that period of time deserves notice, even if it is a year, to change his or her arrangements. After all, one is changing that person's life. That type of predictable security of tenure would work best. The simplicity of it, which reduces the amount of confusion and complexity, makes it a good solution to this problem. It provides rights not only for the tenant but also for the landlord. If somebody is in a tenancy for that length of time and suddenly decides to leave, the tenant would be obliged to secure an alternative tenant to ensure the landlord has security of rent over that period. This would encourage the private rented sector from both the landlord's and the tenant's points of view.I did not see a provision in the Bill that the length of notice varies depending on the length of the tenancy. However, I will take the Minister's point. I have not read it in the Bill but I will analyse what the variable length of notice is. If the Minister is willing to accept the point that the length of stay should be recognised in terms of the length of notice to which one is entitled, I am encouraged. Has the Minister details about the length of time?

Perhaps we will discuss this further on Committee Stage and ensure that the Bill provides that level of flexi bility. If the Minister accepted an amendment to encompass that suggestion, it would be a major improvement of the Bill.I also wish to see some proof being required in section 34 to ensure that the landlord cannot simply say he is thinking of selling the property and thereby be allowed to terminate the tenancy. It would strengthen the Bill if some arrangement could be provided for in that regard. It could be an extra deposit being required from the landlord so that if he does not complete the transaction by a certain time or if it was not clear within a six month period that a relative was living in the property, he would forfeit the deposit. A simple enforcement measure is needed in this section to ensure the tenant has the security of knowing he is not being evicted for another reason. If the Minister is willing to consider two such amendments, it would make this welcome Bill better.

According to Government figures, widely accepted as greatly underestimating the problem, there are 4,060 homeless people in the Dublin area. There are 48,000 families on housing waiting lists across the State, 85% of whom have an income of less than €15,000 per annum. All local authorities report longer waiting lists. The average cost of a house in Dublin is now over €300,000 and across the State it is almost €250,000. According to the latest report by Dr. Peter Bacon, more than 20,000 new homes will be needed in Dublin city centre over the next nine years if population trends continue.Figures give us an overview of the housing problem but do not give us the full picture. They do not tell us what it is like to sleep in a doorway as autumn turns into winter and nights get colder, explain the stress experienced by a mother trying to raise her children in bed and breakfast accommodation while waiting years for a house or what it is like for a young mother to try to boil a baby's bottle in such accommodation. They cannot tell of the frustration experienced by young couples starting out in life with a mountain to climb if they are ever to own a home.I am participating in this debate not as somebody who has no experience in this area. I am a local representative but I have also been a tenant in the past. I have stayed in rented accommodation. I am aware that younger people accept places when they have no choice, and all Deputies will have had some experience of less than adequate accommodation. Recently the case of a young single mother of one living in the Ballyfermot area came to my attention. She is expecting another child in September. She currently lives in the private rented sector, sharing a two-bedroom house with seven other adults and two other children. In all there are 11 people, three of them mothers, in a two-bedroom house. I am beginning to wonder whether the pictures of tenement living seen in "Strumpet City" over the  last few Sunday nights are more documentary than drama.In such a bleak situation, any move from the Government to deal with housing problems is positive, and while this Bill has more than its fair share of flaws, Sinn Féin welcomes it as a small sign that the Government might be seriously considering tackling the housing crisis. It certainly makes a pleasant change from the Government introducing legislation to exacerbate the housing crisis, such as the shameful removal of section 5 of the Planning and Development Bill. I will refer to difficulties with one or two specific sections of the legislation.Section 14 deals with the possibility of landlords taking some sort of action against their tenants if they attempt to exercise their rights. That is an extremely important part of the Bill and it is vital that we get it right. In the past unscrupulous landlords have used every trick in the book to get rid of tenants whom they considered troublesome. Tenants from vulnerable sections of society often choose to put up with the landlord breaching their agreement, including delays in repairs or no repairs at all, since they fear that if they make any complaint they will be without protection against the landlord. I recently dealt with a case in Tallaght where a young mother was living in rented accommodation with rats in the cellar. The vacuum cleaner did not work, and nine times out of ten the heater did not work. That woman ended up being turfed out by the landlord.Though the intention of section 14 is worthy, it must be strengthened. There are many methods, some very subtle, that a landlord can use to retaliate against a tenant. I am not convinced that they were fully understood by those who drafted the Bill. A landlord can turn off the heat, increase the rent – a significant threat in the light of the Government's failure to index-link rent increases or look seriously at rent regulation in this Bill – or refuse to carry out repairs promptly. Those could be ways for a landlord to get at tenants for standing up for their rights and complaining to the board. Are such actions covered by section 14(2) of the Bill? Not only are they harder to prove, they might not necessarily be said to affect what the legislation refers to as the tenant "enjoying" occupation of the dwelling concerned. I ask the Minister to clarify that point in his reply and state whether he believes that section 14 should apply not just to landlords but to their appointed agents. As it stands, it does not seem to cover them.The refunding of deposits is also an area where disputes often arise. I ask that consideration be given to changing section 12(1)(d) to set a specific time by which the landlord should return the deposit or whatever amount to which the tenant is entitled. Landlords are well used to being given money by tenants. They are far less used to giving it back, and that can result in delays for tenants in getting the money they are owed. That problem can be especially acute when the tenant is  relying on that money to be used as a deposit on new accommodation to which he or she is moving or is otherwise counting on it. In such cases, there is intense pressure on the tenant to find money to make ends meet. In some cases that can lead to the tenant accepting a reduced deposit back from the landlord in return for getting it promptly. Threshold has called for the board to hold deposits during tenancies. On the face of it that seems a good suggestion and it would be similar to procedures in other countries. While it might add to the board's administrative burden, it would ensure a transparent, swift and fair system was in place for the handling of deposits.Deputy Gilmore referred last year to section 16(m) of the Bill and laid out some concerns regarding the tenant's requirement to notify the landlord of each person residing in the house. I recall that in times past a hallmark of totalitarian states was that a list of those resident in a house had to be posted outside the door every night for checking at will by the police. While I do not see this section as an attempt by the Minister to introduce a Fascist state, it seems a bizarre addition to the legislation, calling into question a tenant's right to have visitors, possibly even visitors who might stay over. I would much appreciate the Minister explaining the thinking behind that in his response.I would like the Minister to clarify whether the board will be open to queries under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and whether Deputies will have the opportunity to put parliamentary questions to it. I regularly see my parliamentary questions ruled out of order by the office of the Ceann Comhairle on the grounds that such matters are no longer the Minister's statutory responsibility. That can make both getting an answer and holding State bodies accountable all the more difficult.References have been made to Michael Davitt and the Irish Land League. Regarding the private rented sector, I am reminded more of the thoughts of James Connolly, who warned Irish workers that such constitutional Nationalists as Redmond would use them as cannon fodder to obtain a small measure of independence without any social or economic change. As Connolly put it, followers of the Irish Parliamentary Party were fighting so that when they were evicted from their homes, they would be evicted by Irish-speaking officers with harps on their hats.Eighty years after partition, we have a chance fundamentally to reform the private rented sector and take on corrupt and often profit-hungry landlords. While Sinn Féin supports this Bill, its numerous flaws lead me to wonder whether the Government might not be missing another opportunity.

#JohnCartyFF	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-party	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I am glad to be able to contribute to the debate on this important Bill. Introducing it, the Minister referred to it as flagship legislation. He is correct to describe it as such. The Bill introduces for the first time comprehensive protection for tenants. We are all too familiar with media reports of exorbitant rents being charged for inferior accommodation, rents increasing frequently and tenants being evicted with little notice. This Bill sets out to bring some balance to the relationship between landlord and tenant by providing new legal protection to the latter without over-regulating the sector or driving out investment. Good landlords have nothing to fear from this legislation.Before dealing with some of the specific provisions of the Bill, it is important to consider how the private rented sector interacts with the broader housing market and the measures that have been taken in recent years to develop and expand it. The availability of rented accommodation is subject to the availability of new houses generally. Equally, pricing is a reflection of overall housing supply. When demand is in excess of supply, rent charges increase accordingly. Thus, in recent years, many first-time buyers felt obliged to buy homes earlier than they might otherwise have done because of the ever-increasing cost of rent. That, of course, added further fuel to the housing market and house price escalation. For others, such high rent levels prevented their saving to purchase their own properties and pushed the prospect of ownership further away. However, the Government's actions in addressing the demand for housing have been successful.Record-breaking output levels have been achieved. A phenomenal 58,000 units were constructed last year alone. Such high output levels have resulted in a significant slowdown in the rate of increase in house prices. Action has also been taken to address the supply deficit in the private rented sector. Taxation changes introduced in 2001 and 2002, particularly the reintroduction of investor mortgage interest rate deductibility, along with increased house completions, have led to a substantial increase in the supply of rental accommodation and a moderation in rents. In some segments of the market there has been a drop in rent levels for new lettings. For the first time in many years there is rental stability which is in everybody's interest. It is good for the economy, inflation, inward investment and, most importantly, tenants.I wish to address a few remarks to some of the specific provisions of the Bill. Landlords will be precluded from charging in excess of the open market rate. I consider this a balanced response to the charging, albeit by a minority of landlords, of excessive rent. This measure will prevent such unscrupulous activities in the future. At present, a landlord can charge whatever rent he or she  wants and the tenant has no choice except to pay it or seek alternative accommodation.Under the provisions of this new legislation, tenants will have the certainty that they will be charged only the going rate for accommodation. If they consider they are being charged too much they can refer the matter to the new tenancies board for determination. The measure is fair also to landlords as they will be entitled to earn the going rate of return for the investment they have made as accommodation providers. I am equally pleased to see a significant improvement in the security of tenure provision for tenants. After an initial six-month period, a tenant will be entitled to remain for a further three and a half years. I am aware some would like this provision extended even further and the landlord, perhaps, would prefer if the period was shorter. It is a workable compromise to start with and as the sector becomes more professional, landlords will be happy to have good tenants remain for far greater periods.The proposed graduated notice period is certainly a major contrast with the current situation for most tenants on a periodic lease. At present, the landlord has to give the tenant only 28 days to quit. This may not pose a problem for some tenants but for many others it represents a severe hardship. Let us try to imagine a single mother with two schoolgoing children who has been renting her flat for a few years. While the children are at school she has a part-time job. Some 28 days notice for this tenant may prove disastrous. In such a short time she may not be able to find suitable accommodation, locally, at a price she can afford. As a result she may have to move out of the area. This may necessitate having to move the children to a different school and possibly the loss of her part-time job. That scenario is unacceptable in any caring society. The enhanced security of tenure provisions will go a long way to eliminate difficulties of this kind for tenants.An issue that arises constantly in the rented residential sector is that of standards. It is difficult to estimate the number of substandard rental properties around the country. I am pleased that as a result of the massive increase in new house completions in recent years, along with refurbishment tax relief, standards within the overall sector have improved. Nevertheless, some properties remain below the minimum legal standard for which there is no excuse. Part of the problem has been the lack of a cohesive approach to enforcing standards across the local authorities. Some local authorities have been pro-active in this area but many others have done little to respond to complaints from tenants. In this regard, I agree with Deputy Ellis who called for an annual inspection.With the advent of the tenancies board I am hopeful that there will be a significant improvement in the enforcement of minimum legal standards. The board's registration data, which will help identify rented properties throughout the country, will be provided to local authorities to  underpin their enforcement activities. Given the new security of tenure provisions and the prohibition on the penalisation of tenants, it is likely that tenants will refer disputes relating to standards to the board. In the past there was a fear that if a tenant raised concerns about standards he or she was liable to be served with a notice to quit within 28 days.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will, in consultation with local authorities, consider proposals for a strategic approach to the enforcement of standards. This is appropriate. However, it is important in developing a strategy, that the board, the Department and the local authorities, resolve that a firm line be taken with those in breach of the minimum legal obligations. To do otherwise, would be to risk undermining the confidence of tenants and compliant landlords in the legislation.Until now the system has weighed heavily in favour of landlords. The reality is that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, have performed the most radical overhaul of tenants' rights since the days of Michael Davitt, a fellow Mayo man. As the Minister said, "It is an irony of Irish history that the rights of tenants on the land which were well-established over 100 years ago have never been properly established in the law in relation to housing. Today I am righting that wrong."The Bill introduces much needed protection for tenants. It provides for the fair regulation of the sector in a balanced way. An extract from an article by a leading auctioneer in The Sunday Business Post of 28 September 2003 states:This legislation is to be welcomed as it brings certainty, discipline and regulation to a vital sector of the economy, in an area which affects the lives of many people. It is a victory for common sense and provides a sound footing for improvements for tenants while at the same time posing no threat to the professional and responsible property owner.These comments were backed up by a thorough analysis of the main features of the Bill in which the writer cautioned against taking on board arguments made in a vocal campaign against various parts of the legislation which had already been fully considered by the Commission on the Private Rented Sector. I can only endorse those views wholeheartedly.

I spent some time researching and reading in preparation for this debate. I have not listened to many contributions but since I came in I have been appalled that clearly other Members have not read the Bill. I refer Deputy Eamon Ryan to section 65 which deals with his concerns about a sliding scale and he will not need to table an amendment. There are measures in the Bill that will deal with his concerns if landlords do not sell a house hav ing evicted a tenant. I suggest the Deputy take a good look at it before he comes back.In Deputy Crowe's contribution we get a glimpse of what he would like society to be like and how he would make the functioning of vacuum cleaners the responsibility of landlords. This gives us an idea of how deep the role of the State would get into our lives if Sinn Féin ever got into power. He has the gall to call the measures in the Bill "Stalinist". That is ridiculous.This is one Bill I am happy to welcome to the House. I pay tribute to the Minister, the members of and contributors to the commission and, more particularly, to the former Minister of State, Bobby Molloy, who throughout his long and distinguished career in the Dáil and local government sought to bring regulation to the housing market. I am sure he is happy the Bill has finally come before the House. It is radical legislation and is long overdue. Throughout our history, the question of home ownership has probably led to neglect of regulation in this area but the situation is being remedied. The measures proposed in the Bill will bring security of tenure and set minimum standards. In short, it will clean up and regulate the sector and there is no doubt this is needed.Part of the research I did showed the demand for housing. An interesting statistic I came across was the pressure on housing units in Ireland and the rate of construction. For example, last year the UK constructed 150,000 houses while we constructed in the region of 45,000. We cannot keep pace with the demand, with the result that renting privately will be the only option for some people. That is why regulation is long overdue. It will bring professionalism to the sector. To date oral tenancy agreements, under which either party can abscond, have been the general experience.The beauty of this Bill is that it clarifies the roles, functions and demands of landlords and tenants and also offers a basic standard agreement. It is estimated that there are 150,000 residential tenancies in the country but we cannot be accurate in our figures because there has not been compliance with the existing regulations on registration. The figure given for residential tenancies is a ‘guesstimate'. The Bill's provisions will create a database which will not only give us an accurate figure for the amount of residential tenancies but, more importantly, will give information on the standards within that accommodation.I will refer to two specific aspects of the Bill. Compliance is vital to its success, but is the €70 registration fee prohibitive? I would prefer a nominal fee of €20. If one reduces a fee to an acceptable rate, then compliance soars. For example, the last Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Government lowered corporation tax and compliance increased enormously. We should think of that and consider reducing the fee so that it does not become a reason for non-compliance.The other key to the Bill's success is resourcing and "tús maith leath na hoibre" is an old Irish saying we would do well to remember here. If this  area is properly resourced and operates swiftly then people will have confidence and will be delighted to comply with the Bill. Both landlords and tenants need to know that the provisions for dispute resolution will come in swiftly, as that is the radical change which is to take place. In order for that to happen, we must ensure there are no logjams in the system and that will happen if the implementation of the Bill is properly resourced.Section 176 prohibits the institution of proceedings in a court in respect of a dispute that may be referred to by the board for resolution unless the amount claimed by way of damages, arrears or other causes exceeds €20,000. It is not a good idea to include this figure because any such figure remains frozen in time. It would be much better to include a multiple of an annual rent, as some properties can be quite expensive and one would not be long arriving at arrears of €20,000. This provision undermines the purpose of the Bill, which is about swift resolution and not having to go to court. This matter should be examined and I may table an amendment to remove this sense of undermining the thrust of the Bill and of Government policy. Subsection (d) should also be removed in its entirety because it does not need to be there, but that is a matter for Committee Stage. The total effect of section 176, as initiated, would run counter to Government policy and would have people going to the courts very quickly; this should be dealt with.I reject the notion expressed by those outside the House that rights are being taken away by the Bill. They are merely being regulated, and necessarily so. As I said, this is a revolutionary Bill and proper resourcing and compliance will deliver real results. I commend the Bill to the House.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I emphasise that our party spokesman, Deputy Allen, has gone through the Bill in detail and I do not suggest I have read every detail. I will address the broader aspects.Deputy Ellis referred to my reaction to his comments about tax relief in the Shannon basin. I welcome that kind of initiative for rural Ireland and it has been great for Leitrim and also for west Cavan, the area I represent. It caused some problems in my area because when the scheme was referred to in the media on Shannonside Northern Sound, people in the rest of Cavan and in Monaghan felt they were entitled to it also. I know a lot about the scheme because there were so many queries about it. It shows what could be done if the Government looked at the restoration of older houses in rural areas. The tax incentives in the towns lucky enough to get them played a major role not just in improving business premises, but in making high quality flats available to people, which eased the housing situation to some degree.Deputy Ellis also mentioned one-off housing. Given that we are discussing people's living accommodation, I am angry and annoyed with the comments made by the Taoiseach in the west  of Ireland when he indicated that there was some new bright hope for those people seeking one-off housing in rural Ireland. Many people want to live in rural parishes where services, churches and schools are already in place, which have cost the State significant money. The position was made very clear by the Taoiseach when he answered my party leader in the House the other day, saying the only people to get one-off housing in the situations to which he referred were the siblings of farmers, people who owned their own land. That is on the record of the House.I was born and reared in rural Ireland in a parish called Aghabog which was almost dead 35 to 40 years ago. If it were not for returned emigrants and others reared on small housing plots coming back to build in the area and becoming part of the parish, then it would be a much poorer area today. The House should ensure that depopulated areas work under different regulations from those in areas in County Dublin, for instance, which are in the hinterland of the city, Meath, or the Ceann Comhairle's native county, Louth, as well as Galway or Cork. Different regulations should apply to areas of depopulation, such as those covered under CLÁR where extra funds are provided by the Government because it recognises the need to ensure such areas are populated. Those regulations must be clear in order that people know where they stand. I can see no reason somebody who worked in the local flax mill in my parish in the 1950s, whose family has come back to live in this country but never owned land in the parish, should not be allowed to come back and live in the parish on someone else's land. We must have clearer criteria in this area.The Minister said this was one of the most important Bills to come before us. I agree but I heard this about other Bills from his Department and I think of what has happened over the years since this Fianna Fáil-PD Government came into power. We had changes in the tax regime in regard to rented property and property in general which forced many people to stop becoming involved in the business here. They continued to get involved but unfortunately it was in Spain or elsewhere which created a loss of millions of euro for this country. I am glad conditions were changed so that they could become reinvolved with the market here. It is important to be able to change.Deputy Ellis referred to the Bacon report. I wonder about some of the things proposed in that report but people still seem to believe he is the top man as far as ideas on housing are concerned. I wonder about changes that were made to planning laws and the section 5 referred to earlier. Planning laws curtailed planning permissions and reduced the period permission on land could be retained from five years down to two years. This had major effects, especially on small builders in rural areas who wanted to plan the structure of a small housing estate but there was not a demand for all the houses in the first two years. Thank fully that retrograde step has been changed. The social housing clause was also changed because it did not suit some big builders. I welcome change. It shows the importance of discussion in this House and the willingness to change, if necessary. I received many representations concerning planning laws which needed to be changed and I welcome these changes.I also welcome the setting up of the new tenancy board. Part 8 of the Bill states that the board will have a key role of providing a statutory dispute resolution service and will also have responsibility for tenancy registration. This is important. In the context of an ongoing problem in Carrickmacross in my constituency, the Shirley Arms estate has been the cause of long litigation. I am not in a position to say too much about it because the issue is still before the court. As one drives into the main street of Carrickmacross, all the properties on the left side from the first set of traffic lights up to the courthouse are part and parcel of that tenancy. There are a few exceptions, such as the SuperValu premises. The problem has caused enormous anxiety amongst business people and householders. Parnell Street is off the main street and there it is all private tenancies, some of which go as far as 99 years. This debacle has been going on for years.The reason I welcome this Bill so strongly is that it will create a board which will try to resolve such problems between tenants and landlords. A huge amount of money has been wasted on the problem through the legal system but as yet it has not been settled. It is three years since a case went through the High Court but those involved are still waiting for it to go to the Supreme Court. That gives some indication of the delay factor in this sort of situation. Many business people do up their business premises or extend them two or three times but they do not have security of tenure. It is a major issue with which I am not sure this Bill can deal because it is a private residential tenant Bill and does not deal with the business sector. However, I must use this opportunity to highlight this particularly difficult situation.I am not saying that the landlord is totally wrong or that the tenants are totally right but there is an enormous gap between them which is being filled by legal people who are making a lot of money from the situation. I am not sure who will be the winner at the end of the day. I hope this Bill will give some security to the people of Parnell Street and perhaps give them the opportunity of owning their houses. From what I knew of councils in the mid-1980s they made every effort to allow people to become owners of their houses. However, it seems strange that where these people have had to take responsibility for the upkeep of the houses, they can be evicted if they are not properly maintained. That is part of the regulations, as I understand them, that cover the houses in Parnell Street and similar houses; the tenants have no rights whatsoever. I welcome the element of this Bill which will allow the board to provide that they will have rights and privil eges. Deputy O' Malley said that the €20,000 should not be part of the structure in section 176. The more that can be dealt with through a board such as this the better for everybody.Another major problem for the Border region relates to areas where there are not proper third level institutions. About 90% of students from these areas must live in rented accommodation. Every summer public representatives receive queries about application forms to local authorities for grants. When the students actually head for Dublin or anywhere else the main issue is how they can afford to pay such exorbitant rents. We need to have another look at this situation if rural people are to have access to property. There should be more campus accommodation available and this would relieve some of the pressure.Some individuals live in big family homes in this city – their children have left home and their spouse has passed on to their eternal reward – and they do not want to leave. We should introduce some regulation so that those people do not lose their allowances – such as the living alone allowance – if they let part of their house. This could help ease the housing crisis, not just for students but for people in general. It is a shame to see big houses in old housing estates with only one lonely person in them. I would like the Minister to look at the enormous potential there which could be better utilised.Deputy Ellis has already mentioned the down payments parents must find, which is a particularly serious problem for those on social welfare or low incomes. This year, more than ever, students renting accommodation have had to begin paying immediately. They have not had the opportunity to rent from 1 October or mid-September. Therefore, they have had to cover the cost from August or September. This is a significant added cost which many families cannot afford since the rent must be paid for the full year rather than the academic year.Overcrowding of student accommodation also affects the quality of students' off-campus study. A survey in one of the Sunday newspapers showed that a large percentage of student flats are sub standard in that they do not meet buildings and fire regulations, have high rents and are of a low standard, subject to little or no enforcement. In that context, this Bill is urgent.There has been a great deal of discussion about people not paying their tax. A regulation should be inserted into the Bill in order that people who rent accommodation are registered. Unlike Deputy O'Malley, who suggested that the tax rates on rental income be reduced, I suggest that landlords are less concerned with the rates but rather want to rent their property outside the tax regime. Therfore, in this regard, tax avoidance is the main issue and it is an important issue which must be addressed.The ethos of this Bill is welcome in general. My  colleagues will study it in greater detail because it is important that the technicalities are correct and do not impinge on people's rights beyond common sense. There must be some degree of reasonable rent structure and the Bill is welcome in this respect too. However, anyone who suggests this will solve the housing crisis is living in cloud cuckoo land.There has been much talk recently about the different housing schemes available to people – social and affordable housing and private rented accommodation, as well as new housing – some of which has been built by the private sector and some by local authorities. However a garda married to a nurse will still find it difficult to get a loan to buy a house.

There was also an increase in VAT which added €4,000 to €5,000 to the price of an average house. I now understand that some local authorities are considering adding a housing charge of between €4,000 and €7,000 in one county. This will have major implications for young people buying houses. Many applicants for affordable housing cannot meet the criteria because of all sorts of technicalities. I would like these issues examined further. It is the wish of most people to have the right to own their own house at some stage and we must make sure that if we advertise affordable housing, it actually is affordable and people can get into it. We are dealing with the first houses under that scheme in County Monaghan at the moment and many people have been refused.I wish the Bill well and hope it works. However, we have a long way to go to ensure that people on the streets in Dublin will get into houses and that people who want houses in rural Ireland or Dublin City have the right to rent or own their own house.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I wish to share time with Deputy Andrews.The Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 is a long-overdue move to provide consumer protection for private tenants. The Bill, which outlines the minimum legal obligations of landlords and tenants, incorporates measures to improve security of tenure and limits rent to market level and annual reviews at the most. The legislation also provides for the establishment of a statutory private residential tenancies board and a new tenancy registration system. Landlords will be obliged to register all tenancies with the board. There will be a fee of €70 per registration and landlords must lodge with the board their PPS or  company registration number as well as details in respect of tenants.The Bill states that rent reviews should take place once per year, except when the property has been substantially changed. It also states that rents can be reviewed upwards or downwards. Despite recent advances in consumer rights, tenants' rights have lagged behind. Huge profits are made from property and the tenants who generate these profits are fully deserving of rights as consumers.A more professional approach to the rental market is good for investment and tenants and will lead to enhanced property standards, improved management and an increase in quality supply. The Bill will finally establish in law the rights of tenants which were established more than 100 years ago. The place where one lives should have a genuine sense of home, regardless of whether it is rented or purchased.For too long, Ireland has adopted a Victorian approach to property rights. The system was weighed heavily in favour of the landlord and tenants had to clock up 21 years in a property before they gained security of tenure. As a consequence of tenants having few rights and no security, Ireland has been out of step with the rest of Europe. Across Europe, renting is seen as a real medium to long-term option. An effective and law-based rental sector must be part of a modern economy.I was glad to hear that the national housing organisation, Threshold, broadly welcomed the measures proposed in the Bill, as announced by the then Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. One's legal rights derive from landlord-tenant law as well as any written or verbal tenancy agreement between one and one's landlord. One is entitled to quiet and peaceful enjoyment in one's own home and the landlord may only enter with one's permission. If the landlord needs to carry out repairs or inspect the premises, it should be done by prior arrangement. If the property is put up for sale one should ask the landlord to agree viewing times.The landlord must by law ensure that the premises comply with certain minimum standards. For example, it must be free from damp, be in good structural repair, have hot and cold water and adequate heating and ventilation. Appliances must be in good working order and electrical wiring and gas pipes must be in good repair. If the accommodation does not comply with these standards one should report it to one's local authority. An inspection will be carried out and the landlord ordered to do any necessary repairs. One is entitled to have friends to stay overnight, unless specifically forbidden in the tenancy agreement. An extra person moving in would be a different matter. If noise from other tenants or neighbours is causing a nuisance one should tell the landlord. One may also complain to the local authority and one is entitled to a rent book.Up to now the system has weighed heavily in favour of landlords. The reality is that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, has performed the most radical overhaul of tenants' rights since the days of Michael Davitt. He said, "It is an irony of Irish history that the rights of tenants on the land, which were well established over 100 years ago, have never been properly established in law in relation to housing and today I am righting that wrong."The usual suspects on the Opposition side say the Bill does not go far enough. They moan about everything. Sometimes I wonder if they have ever been happy in their entire lives.

I welcome the introduction of the Residential Tenancies Bill. It represents a major and overdue advancement in tenants' rights. Most of us are familiar with the concept that our home is not just the biggest single purchase we make but it is also the most important and it is no less important an expenditure for tenants. Rented property represents the tenant's home and tenants are entitled to a sense of home. The Bill vindicates that right and gives long overdue protection to tenants.I welcome in particular the establishment of a statutory private residential tenancy board. The board will be charged with a number of key functions. It will operate a national registration system for tenancies. Overall, I believe the Bill will bring fairness, certainty and professionalism to the rental sector. It is balanced in its report and provides benefits to both landlords and tenants. I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill to fruition and I look forward to its enactment.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	180	This was his view at the time.  The historical reality is blurred a little bit by people's current political outlook. This is natural enough but it is not fair to Michael Davitt. When we reach the centenary of his death in a few years' time, it will be difficult for Deputy Broughan to have to swallow the reality. It does not suit his outlook at the moment. He had a different view at the time to what the Deputy is currently promoting.On the Bill, many Deputies have discussed issues to which I wanted to refer. I would just make the observation that according to the 1991 census there were 5,000 private rented dwellings in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area which I represented up until recently. By 2002 there were just 2,500 registered private rented dwellings under the 1996 regulations. It bears out what other Deputies have said that there is just a fraction of the registration which should be taking place. A figure of 20% registration was suggested by other Deputies. This is definitely the case in Dún Laoghaire where there has been a huge proliferation of private rented dwellings in the last few years. There is a big problem with enforcement and compliance with basic regulations and basic standards to which many Deputies have referred. The problem rears its head most seriously in September when students are seeking accommodation. The standards to which some tenants must submit themselves are so low that it is a disgrace to us as legislators. I hope the Bill will go some way towards remedying that.Having read through some of it, the Bill needs improvement in certain areas. I would like to bring these points to the attention of Members. The fact that the board can only deal with certain problems where there is a registered tenancy is a bit of a loophole. The tenant can complain but I wonder if a notice to quit, which can be served on the making of the complaint, can be impugned on the basis that there is no registration of the tenancy. I hope when the Bill reaches Committee Stage this loophole will be closed.What has been laid down about referral of disputes is laudable. However, one gaping problem is that while there is a time limit for the referral of a dispute from the time of a complaint, there is no time limit on a decision being made by the tribunal. Section 107 simply says that it must make a decision; it does not say when it must make it. I have seen this problem with the Employment Appeals Tribunal and everyone is aware of the problem with An Bord Pleanála. This costs people money and uncertainty when trying to have something as basic as accommodation settled and plans made for the future. If people are in a dispute they are entitled to a speedy decision. Therefore, section 107 should be amended. The reason this is not a requirement is that the board will need sufficient resources to deliver quick decisions. The fear expressed in the House is that sufficient resources will not be pro vided and we will still have the same problem of lack of registration and so on.Another area I hope the Minister might consider for amendment relates to the exemption for public authorities. This should be amended to apply to housing authorities, as understood under the housing Acts, so that other State agencies that provide tenancies will not be able to avoid the application of the Act.Some of the obligations on tenants in section 16 are not realistic. The fact, for example, that one cannot improve or alter a place without the written consent of the landlord appears far too onerous and requiring far too much administration. Section 17 explains what is altering and improving. Attempts are being made to make drafting easier but the section states, "altering and improving does not include carrying out any works consisting only of repairing, painting or decorating or any of those things". What does that mean? It needs to be amended because it is not clear. The final obligation on a tenant is to notify the landlord "of the identity of each person residing for the time being in the dwelling". Is the tenant required to tell the landlord who is staying there all the time? If one is a student and has a relative or friend staying over, must the landlord be notified? Is failure to notify an offence that could lead to the termination of the tenancy? That is ridiculous but perhaps I do not understand the legislation fully.Everyone is aware of the three Fs, one of which is fixity of tenure. Michael Davitt campaigned on tenancy issues and it is sad that it has taken this long to address them. The six month tenure has been criticised as too long but it will work well, as it is not in the interest of good landlords to change their tenants every six months. That does not provide for good management or planning. The four year term strikes a good balance between the rights of landlords and tenants and that will not cause difficulty.The issue of the constitutionality of the legislation has been raised. Part 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was approved by the Supreme Court, which suggested there is enough flexibility in the Constitution for us, as legislators, to make laws that will improve the rights of tenants without having to worry about constitutional amendments. I hope Ministers will have the courage to bring such reforming zeal to issues such as property prices and a cap on the value of land. There is enough flexibility in the Constitution to address those issues. Although previous rulings of the Supreme Court considered attacks on property rights to be unconstitutional, the decision on Part 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 suggests the Constitution is sufficiently flexible for the Oireachtas to pass laws that will improve people's lives.The commission made a proposal that landlords should carry the burden of proof where an eviction is sought in the courts on the ground that it might be an act of revenge where a tenant has sought to enforce his or her rights. This has not  been provided for in the legislation but it should be considered in the specific circumstance where the tenant has made a complaint to the board. This would improve the position of tenants and no law abiding landlord would have anything to fear from such a provision. It is a matter of balancing the rights between tenants and landlords and this provision would improve the legislation.I do not share the view that landlords will clear tenants out every six months, as few landlords are unscrupulous. I rented happily for 14 years without bother from the various landlords from whom I rented. We should not try to overegg the pudding and say the problem is much greater than it is or vilify landlords when many of them are perfectly fair and organise their affairs appropriately. If anything, there has been a failure on the part of the State to make sure existing laws are enforced. I hope the Bill, which I commend to the House, will remedy the current position.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I welcome the Bill, the appearance of which is incredibly belated. It could have been introduced at least three years ago when the Commission on the Private Rented Sector began to compile its report. My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, repeatedly asked on the Order of Business over the past number of years when the legislation would be introduced. It will be implemented, as usual, on a piecemeal basis, through regulation, by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. That will mean tenants who are in grave difficulty will not experience an improvement in their position for at least another year.I welcome the establishment of the private residential tenancies board, the mediation and determination process through the tenancy tribunal and, at long last, the registration of tenancies. Fianna Fáil colleagues have referred on a number of occasions to Michael Davitt, the great man from Straide in east Mayo where there is an impressive memorial to him. He favoured the nationalisation of all land in the great struggle he led along with Charles Stewart Parnell in Parliament in pursuit of the three Fs so that our ancestors could become the proprietors of land that had been taken over by the descendants of the great planters who had seized it a few centuries previously.Of the three Fs, free sale does not apply under the legislation but fixity of tenure and fair rent are not addressed. "Market rent" is the only reference to rent and it is considered to be the amount a tenant would willingly pay or a landlord would willingly seek. However, rents have doubled and trebled while the Government parties have been in power. It is similar to the straw breaking the camel's back for many young individuals and couples. They are on a knife edge in my constituency as rents exceed €1,600 per month, an incredible rate of return, even given the escalation in house prices. The Bill does not address that problem.Who decides market rent? The tribunal will  refer to the rent that applies in the housing market. I respect the thoughtful contributions of Deputies Andrews and Kelly but it is completely and utterly ludicrous for them to invoke the ghost of the great Michael Davitt in approving the Bill because it does not address fair rent.The legislation contains "a measure of security of tenure for tenants". However, it is a tiny measure and a series of cop-outs is provided for landlords under section 34, including significant refurbishment of the house or apartment, sale of the building or transfer of same to relatives. The list of grounds goes on and on whereby the contract may be terminated between the six month and four year review period. Let us not invoke the spirit of Michael Davitt, my great socialist predecessor. He would turn in his grave that 80 years after independence, this State has not yet established a fair and decent system of renting for tenants in cities, towns and rural areas. We have not even sought to address this area. This feeble Bill is another example of the Government's willingness to make a few small gestures for the poorest section of our population before continuing merrily on its way.A number of Deputies have mentioned that our policies in this area are completely out of step with those of our European colleagues. Countries such as the Netherlands have had a system for a long time that provides fairness and security for tenants. Such a system was introduced in countries that were not afraid to challenge the rights of the landlord and developer classes, which dominate the conservative parties in this House, particularly Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The revelations of the last five years have clarified again and again that certain people, ten or 12 of whom are to be found in my area of Fingal, control all the development land. Such people deliberately release land drip by drip so that the ultimate price they will receive in respect of new houses will be maximised.Three developers in my constituency are scheduled to reap profits of about €1 billion each from the development of about 4,000 accommodation units, most of which are high rise apartments, on the northern fringe of Dublin city. Nothing has been done to ensure that the billions of euro will be used for the benefit of the community. One should not be allowed to take money from young people and families who will be living in or renting the houses in question. One should not be allowed to expropriate other people's money for one's private monetary gain. This serious problem has never been addressed in this country and I regret that this Bill, which contains some small benefits, fails to address it today.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not have a clue how many tenants there are in this country. Why do we not even know this simple fact? Deputy Crawford indicated that the real reason is that the private rented sector has been used as an avenue of tax evasion through the years. Regulations were introduced in 1996 stating that tenancies  were to be registered with local authorities. Those of us living in Dublin know that tens of thousands of landlords have ignored the regulations. As we do not have a picture of what the sector is like – we do not know how many families are involved – we do not know what policies to bring forward. It is an appalling state of affairs.My colleague has pointed out that the private residential tenancies board which is to be established under this Bill, will have a very small staff and limited resources but it will be the start, at least, of the process of trying to find information in this area.Part 7 of the Bill provides for the registration of tenancies. I notice that the relevant section does not seem to specify significant penalties for a failure to register. It says in one of the latter sections that there will be enforcement but I wonder what form it will take. Will it be as feeble as the enforcement of the regulations introduced in 1996? I have mentioned that landlords were able to carry on regardless after regulations were introduced in that year. This Bill represents a tiny step forward in the effort to address a huge problem.We do not know who landlords are because they do not register. I have mentioned that this is partly because they wish to engage in tax evasion. One aspect of this evasion is a refusal to accept rent supplement. Acceptance of rent supplement on the part of a landlord would mean that the tenancy in question would be known to at least one Department, to a health board and perhaps ultimately to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.This feeble Bill contains a number of significant cop-outs. It is appalling that the Government has not sought to address, over the last six and a half years, the key problems illustrated by this Bill. It is shameful that the most recent assessment of housing needs demonstrated that there are about 50,000 on housing waiting lists or are homeless. As the study was conducted last year, the figure may be over 50,000 by now. Such people are desperately seeking accommodation.Politicians in this Chamber and in local authorities are perhaps more aware than most of the housing problem as we encounter examples of it every week. It was brought to my attention yesterday that a number of homeless men are living in a disused barn in my constituency. As the nights are getting colder, four or five men are trying to seek shelter on the edge of a site where a major apartment block is being built on the northern fringe of Dublin city. If one walks along a few streets near Leinster House tonight, which may be a cold night, one will see some of the 5,000 or 6,000 homeless people in Dublin city. One will see old men and women huddling in doorways trying desperately to get through the night with the help of local authority staff and workers from the homeless agencies and other voluntary bodies. It is an appalling state of affairs  in a country that will hold the Presidency of the European Union in a few months' time.We have failed to grapple with reality in a huge area of policy. It has to be said that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, came up with every scheme known to man when he was responsible for this area in the previous Administration. He advocated all kinds of esoterica, such as electronic voting and the abolition of the dual mandate. His attempts to reform Irish government were of the kind that are popular with journalists such as Mr. Stephen Collins. His task, however, was to deal with his Department's central problem – the housing crisis. As the responsible Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey did not address the fact that 50,000 people have no home and the 7,000 or 8,000 people have to live on the streets. Mr. Peter Bacon and others were shoved forward to produce useless reports about investors and the management of housing supply. Reports were produced and placed on shelves while house prices doubled or trebled year after year. The housing list grew and the number of homeless persons increased and the consequence is that people in our cities and around the country will have to huddle together in disused barns.The problems I have mentioned are the legacy of this Government which I hope will be punished by the people next June and in two or three years time when it will be sitting on this side of the House. I have stated that this area has not been dealt with. More than most people in the country, the Government's 88 Deputies are familiar with the reality of this problem from their weekly perambulations around their constituencies. I am also familiar with it, but the Government Deputies have the power to do something about it and I do not.As the father of the House, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will remember a great politician who served the Labour Party when it was in power. I refer to the great Mr. James Tully from County Meath who is often looked up to as a Minister for Local Government who did his job well. He was a great trade union leader and a great Minister. He saw that the housing list was very long when he took office in 1973 and he decided to address the problem. He built between 25,000 and 30,000 houses for people who were homeless or on the housing list. Year after year he turned out that kind of output. He did not turn out 50,000 housing units, mostly apartments, for investors. He turned them out for the people. He is the template by which Ministers such as Deputies Noel Dempsey and Cullen should be judged. Those Ministers failed, and after 1987 their party abandoned the concept of social housing.When I had been a member of Dublin Corporation only a few weeks I attended a housing seminar presided over by Deputy Michael Smith, who was then Minister for the Environment. He could not tell us how he was going to increase housing supply. At that time almost no houses were coming on stream in Dublin when between 4,000 and 5,000 families were on the housing list. I told the  Minister what I thought of him and led the Labour Party and Sinn Féin councillors out.In the 20 years since the disastrous Government of 1987 we have seen a complete squeeze on social and affordable housing. Things have become more and more difficult for young couples. In the past couple of weeks I have made representations on behalf of a young self-employed person who is having difficulty showing his local authority that his income is below the €80,000 limit for a couple applying for a local authority house.We thought that Part 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 – an initiative taken by the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey – would be a turning point and that 20% of all housing developments would consist of social and affordable housing. What happened? The developers, who are the backers of the Fianna Fáil Party, squealed and said this could not happen. They froze their developments and refused to increase the supply of houses. A few months ago a new planning Bill was dragged into the House to remove the onus from developers and allow them to give a sum of money or to move their social and affordable housing developments to a different place away from the part of the county where accommodation was needed. The slight improvement which Deputy Noel Dempsey planned was abandoned by his successor, Deputy Cullen.Public representatives try, week in and week out, to advise and give information to our constituents on the availability of social and affordable housing. Our constituents find themselves on a knife edge. Even with a shared ownership mortgage, a young couple can barely afford to take an affordable mortgage. Where will this end? I hope it will end with a new Government. Throughout this period taxation policies have favoured investors at the expense of young couples and families.We have not attempted to come to grips with the situation produced by this poisonous alliance of an incompetent Government with its 20 years failure on housing and powerful developers who have held it to ransom. The people who pay the piper are calling the tune.If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was serious this Bill would be one of a series of Bills. We would see a major housing Bill. While I welcome the Bill's reference to anti-social behaviour and the attempt to define what that might be, the wider problem of anti-social behaviour in many urban estates has never been addressed in legislation. There is a need for such legislation. There is a need for the Bill announced by Deputy Gilmore this morning to take control of what developers have been doing to our country.The Bill is a damp squib. It is a feeble response to a problem the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, knows exists. Homeless people are counting on him and, once again, he and his Government have failed them.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I welcome the limited progress on tenants' rights made in this Bill. Where does the Government stand on this legislation? We know that Fianna Fáil probably supports it but do the Progressive Democrats? We saw an example this morning of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform having one position on the deal with the religious orders and the Tánaiste having a different one. They appear to be at loggerheads. If we are to have stability in the Government it is vital that the junior partner has a clear position on legislation. It is clear that Deputy McDowell has a skewed idea of collective Cabinet responsibility. His out of control ego prevents him from understanding this. He is not a team player. He has had more solo runs than Mick O'Connell in his heyday. I hope we will have clarity on this issue. It is vital.Like Deputy Broughan, I have had to deal with people living in private rented accommodation who want Dublin City Council to provide them with accommodation. Every Friday afternoon, when I deal with this problem, the queue is longer. In many cases people are mistreated by landlords. This is happening with greater frequency.Does this House stand on the side of landlords or of tenants? The Green Party is, unashamedly, on the side of tenants. This legislation does not go far enough in helping tenants in this city. Many of them are living in dreadful conditions, are being overcharged and have no security of tenure. They can be told, and are being told with regularity, that they must leave within a month or that their rents will be doubled overnight.This legislation seeks to deal with this problem but we are far behind other countries. I recently visited a colleague in Berlin. He showed me around his beautiful three-bedroomed flat in Schoneberg in Berlin, for which he pays €600. When one contrasts the conditions enjoyed by tenants in Berlin with those of tenants in Ireland one begins to realise how bad things are in this country. In Germany, as long as tenants respect things they will have security of tenure, will not be overcharged and can make additions to the premises that will make it a home. That does not happen in this country.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	184	That is why the Green Party introduced legislation to increase supply. The Government voted against it. Who does a shortage of supply favour? It favours the Minister of State's friends, namely, the landlords and speculators. Therefore, he is happy for the shortage of supply to continue so they can continue to charge exorbitant rents.The legislation seeks to introduce the new concept of a Part 4 tenancy. This concept, in itself, is a good idea, but if one reads the legislation one will see that there are many loopholes. If one considers the idea of the controlled tenancy one will  realise that it was a way of ensuring that tenants could not be kicked out. However, as an elected representative, I became familiar in recent years with the ways landlords got around this. They went to court and actually managed to get tenants out of controlled tenancies. If they could do so, how much easier will it be for them to do so under this legislation? Landlords will drive a coach and four through this legislation. They will go through it piece by piece and those who feel secure with the Part 4 tenancy may not be as secure as they think.Threshold has issued some press releases about the Bill and has expressed concerns. Its point on the registration of landlords is absolutely valid. The penalty for failing to register is €140. This is ludicrous and does not serve as a deterrent to any landlord. We need to ensure that landlords are registered and that they comply with all the stipulations. This could be done if the political will existed.

On late registration, a fine of €140 does not act as a deterrent.On 3 June The Irish Times termed as “outrageous” the commitment in the Bill to keep information on rents and rented accommodation away from the Revenue Commissioners. In a sense, we were enshrining law breaking into law, which is completely unacceptable. We need to examine the Bill in detail and understand that it has deficiencies, which I hope we can address in detail on Committee Stage.The Irish Property Owners Association obviously believes that the Bill is biased against landlords and interferes excessively with its members' traditional rights. It objects to the establishment of a new system of registering rented properties with a new private rented tenancies board and regards it as a bureaucratic nightmare. Until now, the association's members have had a charmed life. Any small bit of progress is seen by them as interference. I believe the Bill is absolutely necessary and that we are not going far enough. It seems that we are still back in the 19th century given the way that we kowtow to landlords.Other issues have to be considered, some of which were referred to by Deputy Cuffe. He referred to them as the escape clauses for landlords. The first can be exploited in circumstances where the landlord lives in one half of the rented house and there are more than two units in the house. I refer to the loophole in respect of the Part 4 tenancy.Will the Minister elaborate on how one judges the failure of the tenant to comply with the tenancy contract? If a tenant does not comply with  one small aspect of a contract with many clauses, does that mean that he can be evicted? I can understand why an eviction could take place when the tenant engages in "serious anti-social behaviour". However, it must be defined clearly. Does "anti-social behaviour" mean having a party occasionally? I suppose a judge would have to examine this at a future date.Loopholes exist where the dwelling is no longer suited to the accommodation needs of the household in terms of the number of bed spaces, where the landlord has contract to sell property in three months and where the landlord requires property for occupation by family members. These will be used by landlords to get out of their contracts and to the disadvantage of their sitting tenants.We have made a start by introducing the four year rule although tenants can be kicked out in the first six months of those four years. Four years is a short period in one's life. It is shorter than a Government's normal term in office. Some Members have been kicked out after five years. When one's livelihood and family depend on a tenancy, it is a different matter. The problem is that we have not developed a culture of apartment living. It is the norm in Europe for families to live in apartments. I tabled a question in the early 1990s—

When I tabled a question in Dublin Corporation in the early 1990s, I discovered that there were very few families living in new apartment blocks in the inner city because they were not designed properly for families. One will realise this when one sees how steep the stairs are. If we are to encourage people to live in apartments, we must build apartments that are suitable for families. We are failing to attract more people into the city and to provide more playgrounds and therefore we need to state in legislation that dwellings have to be family friendly. We have not done so, resulting in one more deficiency in the Bill.

Is cuimhin linn ar fad gur fhoghlaim muid ar scoil mar gheall ar chogadh na talún nuair a throid daoine ar son na three Fs. Is trua go raibh orainn fanacht chomh fada seo. Is trua go raibh an Teachta Kelly ag rá gur whingers a bhí ar an dtaobh seo den Teach, gur Bille maith é agus gur chóir dúinn glacadh leis. Nílim sásta glacadh le haon rud díreach toisc go ndeireann duine amháin gur rud maith é.  Fiú laistigh dá pháirtí féin, mar a léirigh an Teachta Andrews, feictear deacrachtaí ins an mBille seo. Is trua, tar éis an fhad a bhíomar ag fanacht ar an mBille seo, nach bhfuil sé foirfe. Nuair atáimid ag déileáil le Bille chomh mór leis an gceann seo tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh sé foirfe, go mbeadh éifeacht leis agus go gcuirfeadh sé athrú iomlán ar an Stát, ó thaobh tionóntaithe de ach go háirithe.Tá ceisteanna fós ann nach bhfuil an Bille tar éis tabhairt fúthu. Nuair a dhéanann an Bille a bhealach tríd an Teach, tá súil agam go ndéanfar leasaithe air a dhéanfaidh níos foirfe é, a dhéanfaidh sé níos éasca don phobal déileáil leis agus go mbeidh cearta ann a bhéadh ina bhuntáistí don phobal.Some of the problems with housing in Ireland are related to bad planning. Other factors include the baby boom in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the end of emigration and the failure to address the problem of student accommodation and the need for social housing. Since the foundation of the State, successive Governments have failed to tackle the vested interest of landlordism. This is because so many landlords have had friends in the main political parties, which have been vested with control and the enactment of legislation in this State. The result has been a haphazard approach to this issue and an acceptance by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats of tax avoidance by landlords as a class.Income from rent should be taxable, but nothing in the Bill will ensure this. It is no excuse to plead that it is impossible to identify landlords or the number of dwellings in the private rented sector. Nevertheless, I hope the legislation will begin to address these aspects and that, in time, the Exchequer will benefit from the money currently going into the black economy. Landlords who are not tax compliant have not availed of the opportunity to register their property or their interests. They are running a business, which does not give them a licence to print money. They have obligations, not only to their tenants, but to their neighbours, the local authorities, the State and the Exchequer.By suggesting that the minimal registration fee of €70 should be reduced to €20 in an attempt to encourage landlords to register, Deputy O'Malley has effectively said that landlords should be rewarded for non-compliance. It is a crazy suggestion and it would encourage tax avoidance by rewarding those who, over the years, have been non-compliant.There is nothing in the legislation to ensure that the ongoing quiet forms of discrimination will not continue. Landlords in this city have been guilty of discrimination against immigrants, those in receipt of rent allowance, single parents and those who have children. Similarly, the Bill makes no mention of minimum standards. People in this city are living in cramped, damp accommodation which is unfit for human habitation. In most cases the health board pays the rent, which means the  State is paying landlords to allow people to live in unfit accommodation. The Bill contains no provisions dealing with minimum accommodation standards, such as size of dwelling, the maximum number that should be allowed live in, say, three bedroom houses or one bedroom apartments, whether bedsits should have hot and cold running water, a shower, bath or indoor toilet, provisions regarding the disposal of sewage and waste and the condition of fire escapes.While some provisions cover insurance aspects, what is the position regarding public liability insurance? Who is to enforce these provisions? Will it fall to the Private Residential Tenancies Board?The legislation will encourage landlords to offer tenancies for periods of either less than six months or up to four years. There is no attempt to move towards the European norm, where long tenancies apply, of ten, 20 and 30 years. While notices to quit must provide reasons, there is no reason why the legislation should not ensure that tenancies should be of a longer duration. Landlords should be encouraged to move towards that situation.While the Bill includes many good provisions, it does not address the question of affordability. There is a need to change the current position where, in this city, it is cheaper to have a mortgage than to rent, even given the ridiculous prices at which houses are being sold. People find they must take the mortgage option rather than, as they see it, squander dead money on rented accommodation.Deputy Eoin Ryan said that rents in the city have stabilised. I do not know where he lives, because in the constituency of Dublin South-Central prices continue to rise, especially for those who are dependent on health board rent allowances. They are being forced out. The landlords know the limit at which health boards are willing to pay and they are setting their rents at that amount or above. They are then asking tenants to make underhand payments to ensure they can stay.I hope to address many other issues on Committee and later Stages. It is good to see that the legislation will impose obligations on tenants and landlords with regard to anti-social behaviour. However, that will not solve the major problems in this area. Aspects such as the role of the Garda Síochána and questions of proof need to be addressed. While the Bill does not fully address this issue nor the underlying causes, it is a step in the right direction.I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that minimum standards prevail so that we do not have slums emerging again in Dublin. That happened in the last century and it should never be repeated. The imposition of minimum standards will help to ensure that people do not live in unfit accommodation.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The Minister of State is cor rect that the housing problem is related to the balance between demand and supply. At present there is insufficient supply.The Bill is concerned with regulating the private sector with regard to rented accommodation. The Minister of State has responsibility for those living in the public housing sector. I am aware of a person who is a chronic alcoholic and who has encountered many health problems. He also had many difficulties and did not pay his rent. He received a notice to quit from the council. Eventually he wound up in court. I was disappointed that the court did not see fit to grant him representation.Will the Minister of State ensure either through legislation or ministerial order that, in future, when local authorities evict people from their homes, be they mothers with three children, single people with drink problems or people in difficulties with their rent, the authorities ensure these people have representation, because they cannot afford to employ a solicitor? At least in that case they will have the right to put their side of the story before the court.It annoys me that, in such court cases, there are three or four council officials and the State or council solicitor, all paid for by the taxpayer, and that includes their travel expenses, while the poor creature in court has no one to represent him or her. I hope the Minister of State does something about this. I have raised it at the Committee on Social and Family Affairs and with all the voluntary organisations that deal with the weak, poor and homeless. Legislation such as this Bill to protect the private sector should not be enacted when the Minister of State will not protect people for whom he is responsible, namely, those in council housing.The Bill does not go far enough but is a beginning and a step in the right direction on the basis that we will now try to protect people in rented accommodation. Under this legislation, landlords are not required to give a tenant a contract for the first six months, after which they must give him or her a four-year lease. Landlords being who they are will, if a prospective tenant offers a higher rent within six months, evict the sitting tenant, and they will not have to give a reason for so doing. This should be examined immediately. If a tenant pays his or her landlord and does not do anything wrong for the first six months, he or she should be protected. This works both ways.There is nothing wrong with owning property or being a landlord, but there is something wrong with landlords who do not provide proper accommodation, care for their tenants and, because there is such a demand for rented accommodation, feel they can do as they wish. I welcome the attempt in the Bill to try to regulate these people. I am not enthusiastic about regulation because we are regulated too much and the country is turning into a police state. Increasing amounts of money are spent on hiring more council staff to oversee these regulations. I hope exist ing council staff can enforce this legislation and that additional staff do not have to be hired. If not, it will create more problems.The Minister of State has a responsibility to the 50,000 families seeking housing. We have a serious housing problem, part of which could be resolved tomorrow and I will give an example as to how. I speak as a former auctioneer. I often wish I had remained in the business because the property market was very good in recent years. I left at the wrong time. That said, I believe in one job for one person and that one cannot do two jobs. I am a full-time politician now. I have experience of the rented sector, although I wish to record that I do not own rented property.The seaside resort scheme gives a tax break to people for ten years. I see accommodation built under this scheme in my town and in Achill and elsewhere which must be available to rent from April to October or vice versa and which in some cases is vacant for nine months of the year. I know of an estate of 300 houses where, at Christmas, there is not one light in any of the houses. The Government should abolish this tax break and strike a deal with those who availed of it if they sell their houses to people who want to buy it at an affordable price. It would release a few thousand houses in the short term. Many people are tied into the scheme because of the tax break. They would sell their properties within ten years if they could get out of the tax break without being penalised. I hope the Minister of State can examine that.A previous speaker referred to people on the housing waiting list. While a points system for the list is operated in Dublin, it is not in place in Mayo. When social housing becomes available there, people's needs are assessed. It has happened that, if a person rents accommodation near where social housing is being built and perhaps six months before it is allocated, he or she is almost guaranteed a house. I hope the Bill deals with this. Legislation is also in place which requires that, when such people are housed, their former accommodation be either closed or made habitable. That is not being enforced by local authorities and it should be.There was a time when, if a person was on a local authority list, he or she was housed only once. I know of people who have two or three such houses. Some were renting accommodation, got into difficulty and went back on the housing list and were housed. Some live with partners in three or four bedroom houses for about two years, have a row with the partner and move out with the children leaving the partner alone in a three or four bedroom house. The Minister of State and his Department must examine this because it is not right if a woman and her children leave such a house, the partner remains in it because the rent is being paid, and she goes into rented accommodation and takes someone else's place on the housing waiting list. This should be examined promptly.Another scenario is where people are accom modated in houses that cost €120,000 to €130,000 of taxpayers' money to build. After two to three years, they can obtain a mortgage to buy the house. They then build a massive house on a site and sell the local authority house for a huge profit. If I was Minister of State with responsibility for housing, the first action I would take would be to order that people who have bought their houses from a local authority and want to sell them before they have lived there for ten years must sell them to the council for whatever price they bought them or a percentage of the sale price.

At the same time, I see from the local newspaper that a developer has applied for planning permission to refurbish a local authority house. The council will not give consent to the person who wants to live in the house while the builder has consent because he already has a pub in the town and has also applied for planning permission for a restaurant. This is not good enough. We must deal with it and not allow it to continue. It is no wonder we have a housing problem. I appeal to the Minister of State and his officials to examine this to try to tighten it up.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I will, along with the notice in the newspaper. I will also give the Minister of State a few more examples of local authority houses being rented out in this fashion. It must be dealt with once and for all. We cannot have a situation where taxpayers subsidise builders. It must stop. People are entitled to social housing, but they are not entitled to abuse the system. The rights of tenants renting accommodation must be protected but those living in social housing must respect it. Local authorities are not enforcing the law as regards the condition in which some social housing tenants keep their houses, and they need to do so.A welcome aspect of the Bill is that it will allow us at least to register those people we know to be landlords and ensure they provide proper accom modation to a standard to which people are entitled. It is wrong that young people and families are living in substandard accommodation for which they are charged the top rate, simply because there is a shortage of housing and rented accommodation.The Minister of State's party has been in office for almost 17 of the past 20 years. The time has come to introduce legislation – the will is there – to get rid of vested interests, by which I mean builders. Builders have controlled too many political parties, in particular the Fianna Fáil Party, for the past 50 years. They appear to be dictating housing policy. If the Government were to give local authorities the necessary resources to buy green field sites tomorrow, they could install sewerage and water systems, make sites available at affordable prices and build social housing. The builders would then have to compete.All business revolves around competition. One has problems where one has a monopoly. This is the case with the ESB and was the case for a long time with Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann. We will have to compete with builders who now control the land and are buying it up in every town and village. They are even buying fields set well behind main roads with future opportunities in mind. Now that they own the land, they will control events into the future. This is wrong and, as legislators, we must do something about it. We cannot allow honest young people who decide to marry or live together and try to build or buy houses to have to compete with builders. In my town, young people have to compete with a man in America who wants to buy a house and leave it vacant for perhaps ten years.

That is not something I find easy  but I will do my best. We have a serious problem which we must address, namely, young people trying to compete with others who are buying holiday homes which they leave empty for ten or 11 months each year.We also have the question of the planning process which we have discussed in the House on previous occasions. I am glad the Taoiseach has given a commitment on the matter and hope he will honour it. Having listened to him during the week, however, I doubt he will. If sons or daughters, brothers or sisters, uncles or aunts want to build on their family's land, they should be accommodated where possible. I hope the necessary legislation will be laid before the House to ensure this occurs.The Minister of State has a difficult job in the area of housing, the single biggest issue facing the country. The issue of young people trying to get a place to build their future with their families is creating major problems. One of my constituents visited me the other day. Both she and her husband have jobs which would have been regarded as excellent a few years ago. They are searching for a site on which to build and the cheapest they can find in my town costs €140,000 to €150,000. While they can afford to buy the site, they cannot afford to build a house on it.The affordable housing scheme, one of the greatest schemes introduced in recent years, is now beginning to work. The Minister of State and the Department should push it more. It involves local authorities building and selling houses and completing all the necessary paperwork on behalf of the buyers. I ask the Minister of State to encourage local authorities to promote the scheme and to provide them with the resources needed to buy land and build more houses in order that more people will be able to buy their own homes. People are prepared to buy a home when they receive a little help. The abolition of the first-time buyer's grant was not helpful and put further pressure on those who needed it, namely, people building moderately sized houses under 1,360 sq. ft. This group needed a little assistance.While many people are concerned about certain aspects of the Bill, it marks a step in the right direction. There appears, for example, to be concern about the issue of registration. The Minister of State will be in a position to introduce further legislation on the housing issue in the future. I ask him to address the anomalies in the legislation on Committee Stage.People who are prepared to be up-front and provide good rented accommodation should not be slammed. I have nothing against those who rent out accommodation openly and honestly. They are needed because the State has failed. There is nothing wrong with owning property and I have nothing against property owners. They did not rob banks but had to borrow and take risks. It is a business for them. A common and positive feature of people is that we all want to own our  homes. We should try to make it easier for people to obtain sites, build homes and find accommodation.I ask the Minister of State to address some of the points I have raised, particularly with regard to seaside resorts and council schemes. We need a completely new qualification system for council housing. People should be housed only once unless very serious circumstances arise. As a public representative, an issue that causes great upset among my constituents is when they wait on a housing list for years, only to be pushed off it when a crisis arises elsewhere. Some people are proper and honest when they put their names on a housing list and describe their circumstances. They are not prepared to accept bad accommodation and want to do the best they can for their families. These people need help, support and protection.

For one reason or another, my council appears to favour its current system. I have spoken on the issue at council level and intend to take it up when we re-examine our letting priorities. The points system would be fairer than the current system. It is terrible when people move into a town because they know council houses are being built and accommodation will become available within a short time. This happens regularly. Our letting priorities mean these people are given priority. This is wrong and I intend to address the matter at local level. I ask the Minister of State to address the other issues I have raised.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I agree with many of the points made by my colleague, Deputy Ring. At a time when we have more than 50,000 people on housing waiting lists, it is disheartening that some people who deserve housing, including some in my county, are waiting to be allocated council housing. In County Wexford we use the points system and it works well. Some councillors have told me the council waiting list for housing has not been so large since they were elected. I call on the Minister of State to ensure that every county is allocated additional funds to build more local authority housing, of which there is never enough. He will no doubt argue he has allocated a certain amount to County Wexford, County Mayo and elsewhere but funding for local authority housing is never sufficient.There is a large number of gangsters – perhaps I should not use that term – involved in the provision of student accommodation. There are good and bad landlords and the latter are easy to find. Students who move to Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Carlow or other towns to attend regional technical colleges or other third level institutions have to seek accommodation.There is plenty of student accommodation but much of it is in bad condition. We saw some  sights, especially in Dublin. I went to visit one student's flat because I did not believe the story his parent told me. All he had was a bedroom with a shower in the corner and a small room off it which contained a cooker and a sink. He had to share the toilet with four other tenants. The prices these students are charged are also unbelievable. Paying for this accommodation puts the students' parents under great pressure, particularly if the student does not qualify for a grant. No parent wants to see their son or daughter having to live in bad conditions when they go to study in Dublin or elsewhere, particularly when they are paying high rents.I am glad all landlords will have to be registered. That is only right because they are getting away with blue murder. I am aware of one student who paid a deposit of €1,000 last year for his accommodation. His landlord was in England and had put a caretaker in charge of the apartment. When the student sought the return of his deposit in May this year, the caretaker would not return it. She said she wanted to inspect the apartment and check it for damage. There was an outstanding ESB bill of €300 and the caretaker said she would take that amount from the deposit and pay the bill. She promised to return whatever money was left. The student only got €250 back from his €1,000. The landlord had spent €750. He spent €300 on the ESB bill and the rest on paint and so forth.The student was not happy to get only €250 back but he was delighted the ESB bill had been paid. However, he soon received a solicitor's letter in the post on behalf of the ESB. That is when he came to me with his story. I contacted the ESB and explained what had happened. I was told the ESB could do nothing because the bill was in his name. When I told of how the landlord took the money for the bill out of the deposit, the people in the ESB did not want to hear. Hopefully, this legislation will prevent this type of occurrence. That is just one story I know but I am sure other public representatives know hundreds more.Deputy Broughan spoke about the thousands of homeless people on our streets. It is terrible to see them. When I leave the Dáil at night for my accommodation, I see people lying in doorways, laneways and on the sides of the street. They have no place to go. There is no accommodation and no houses or hostels available. Members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others come around with soup and sandwiches for these people. They are to be complimented for looking after the homeless. The Government is not looking after them. Numerous reports have been compiled which claim that the Government is doing a number of things for the homeless but it is doing nothing.The Minister of State is only a year in office and I know he is doing his best but some of his predecessors or perhaps his brother, the Taoi seach, should go out on the streets at night and see the homeless people there. Let the homeless tell how they have to live. It is a crying shame. We have had the Celtic tiger economy but there are still homeless people on the streets. There are probably more homeless people now than ever before. The number is certainly not dropping.One sees homeless people on the streets of Wexford, a small rural town, and towns throughout the country. Deputy Broughan spoke about people he knew who are living in a type of barn. I am aware of somebody in my constituency who is living alone in a back shed in an old housing estate. What future has he? He is on the housing list but he does not have the points to get to the top of the list to ensure he gets a house. There is much work to be done on this issue.The provisions regarding anti-social behaviour are not strong enough in the Bill. I can give an example of such behaviour in a council estate in Wexford. This family has pulled down the stairs, doors and skirting boards to burn them. The council has to wait on court injunctions and other legal proceedings to have this family removed. Generally, the council has extremely good tenants. A family has bought the house next door to the tenants I mentioned. This family is in dire straits as a result of the anti-social behaviour of the family next door. What is happening is unbelievable. These people throw their rubbish out the back door and might leave it there for three or four months. The council is doing its best but anti-social behaviour has to be dealt with more strongly in the Bill. It is a serious matter and it is frustrating for families who are paying their rent and so forth.I feel strongly about this issue. I did not see anti-social behaviour until I became involved in public life. I live in the country and I do not know what it is to have bad neighbours. My neighbours are good and I hope they will remain that way. I hate to see good, honest, decent people having to live with anti-social behaviour next door.Only one in five landlords is on the register. This register is most important. There are thousands of landlords in Dublin alone but only one in five is registered. I do not know how the Minister will trace all the landlords in this city. Many landlords will not wish to come forward and declare their rented accommodation because they have been getting away with blue murder over the last number of years. They will wish to remain unregistered and continue as they are. The Minister should ask the colleges to encourage students to go into registered accommodation. This will have to be done to ensure all landlords are registered. If they are not registered, the situation will not change.I welcome this Bill but it could have been more wide ranging. I read the submission on the Bill from Threshold and I am sure our spokesperson, Deputy Allen, will deal with those points on  Committee Stage. Deputy Ring spoke about planning permission. It is a major problem in every county in the country, especially in Wexford where people cannot build a home in their local town or village. People come down from Dublin and get planning permission to build houses. They might stay in those houses for one or two months in the year and after a couple of years or so sell them for exorbitant prices. It is terrible.Every day I receive representations from people who are unable to get planning permission to build on their own or a relative's land. It is sad that these people are unable to live in their locality. I was delighted when the Taoiseach said that in certain circumstances people should be allowed to build where they want.

Changes are being made to the County Wexford development plan at present to alleviate the planning permission problem. It is a major problem in every county. I have spoken to local representatives from all parties and especially to those representing rural areas in Wexford, Mayo, Galway, Waterford, Cork and Kerry. Every day they are being hounded with planning permission problems. It is terrible to have to visit a planner to sort out two or three points. Two planning permission applicants have already been in contact with me today looking for things such as a landscape plan. It is an important item but it should be possible to grant planning permission and ensure that people carry out the work, although some of them might not do it after getting the permission.Housing is a little like the health system in terms of the number of reports that have been carried out on it. The Bacon report was published and nothing has been done since. Mortgage interest relief was scrapped and the demand for rental accommodation went absolutely through the roof, as did prices. In county Wexford we see single parents paying exorbitant prices for rented accommodation. They receive money from the health board –€50 or €60, perhaps €70 if they are lucky – to pay the rented accommodation, which may cost €150 or €160 per week. It is absolutely terrible what landlords are getting away with. Deputy Seán Crowe spoke earlier about three or four parents and an awful number of children living in a two-bedroom apartment. That is happening everywhere – not just in Dublin but in every county. I only saw it when I was canvassing for last year's general election. I saw the accommodation people are renting out and the people who have to put up with it because they do not have enough points to get on the housing list.I have one or two other things to say before I  finish. I was very disappointed that the Government scrapped the first-time buyers' grant because it helped people. I know it was not very high – perhaps €3,000 or €4,000 – but it helped people to furnish their houses or put in a kitchen; it gave them an incentive. Since the first-time buyers' grant was abolished, many additional people have gone on the housing list. It is very hard to get a mortgage if one cannot fulfil specific criteria. People are unable to keep up with the payments on a mortgage. If they are unable to get housing or accommodation, they could rent a house from the council and, after three or four years, if their circumstances change, they should be able to buy the house from it.One other thing is very important, and I feel very strongly about it – housing for the elderly. In my own town of Enniscorthy, sheltered accommodation was built with Government grant aid for elderly people. That initiative should be encouraged more. They were one – or two-bedroom houses in the town close to the church and shops. The old people could go into the town centre even if they were unable to drive. It was great to see those old people living in these houses with a nurse on site and a doctor calling every so often. They get meals on wheels or can go to the hall where there is entertainment every night. It is a great initiative, and I encourage it. Many people would do the same thing in parishes and towns across the country if the Government could give them some grant aid. I know that the Minister has given it over the years—

At present they may be living alone, perhaps afraid, out in country areas but they can now come in and live independently and make plenty of new friends. I would encourage the Government and the Minister to give increased grant aid to such people. He mentioned a percentage, but—

Since he has said that, perhaps he could give us a commitment right now.I am delighted to see this Bill coming through the House and I hope it will make landlords maintain properties to proper standards and that when students or whoever go into the private rented sector, they will not be living in squalor and I hope they will not be paying exorbitant prices. There are many other things I would like  to change in the Bill and I know that our spokesperson on the environment, Deputy Bernard Allen, will be doing so. I compliment the Minister on his past work and I hope he keeps it up. That reminds me of his election slogan "A lot done. More to do." There is more in the latter category.

Given that approximately 12%, or one in ten households, are in the private rented sector, this legislation is long overdue. This Bill, among other things, introduces a measure of security of tenure for tenants. Unlike many of our European neighbours, that right was not enshrined in legislation and I am pleased to see that, when this Bill is passed, that will no longer be the case in Ireland.I might also add that I am particularly pleased to see the establishment of a private residential tenancies board in Part 6 of the Bill under the heading "Dispute Resolution". Like many other Deputies, I have received very many representations on the issue of anti-social behaviour – noise, etc. For someone living in the vicinity whose sleep is disturbed on a regular – or even irregular – basis, that constitutes not only a serious nuisance but it can make life unbearable. If one adds to that the circumstances where there might be young children or someone is ill, the situation becomes untenable. While this Bill will not solve all the problems, at least it provides a mechanism for dispute resolution in one form or another.I am pleased to see that the enforcement of determination orders of the board that are not complied with will be through the Circuit Court. I am also pleased to see that in Part 2 of the Bill there is an explicit onus on landlords to enforce tenant obligations, and one of those specified obligations on tenants is not to engage in or allow anti-social behaviour. Failure to do so will allow another person, for example, a neighbour, who can show that he or she is adversely affected by the tenant's non-compliance with the tenancy obligations to refer the complaint to the board concerning the landlord's failure to enforce. As I said, the enforcement of such orders not complied with will be through the Circuit Court. It will not solve all our problems with anti-social behaviour, and I agree with Deputy Paul Kehoe that it is a huge issue. There is an onus on us all as legislators to deal with it. At least this Bill is a start, and I know many people will welcome that section of the Bill.In the context of the widespread tax evasion we have seen in recent times, there must be protection for any tenant subjected to unfair treatment, including cessation of tenancy, following his or her insistence on measures which would conflict with the landlord's non-compliant attitude to income deriving from the tenancy. In that  and other respects, it is difficult to understand the inclusion of a six-month period during which a tenancy can be terminated without giving any reason. It seems obvious that any tenant who would wish to pursue rights under this Bill and who is not prepared to co-operate with the tax dodging landlord, could find it very difficult to secure the four year tenancy referred to in the Bill. A method of penalising such landlords, including reference to the Revenue Commissioners, should be included in the Bill.Another issue often spoken about in Deputies' clinics and not, I believe, addressed in this Bill, is the situation where rent supplements have been capped. That means that a rent supplement will not be payable where the amount of rent exceeds the appropriate maximum. Various health boards have set definitions of reasonable rent but in some cases they are too low. For example, in the North Western Health Board area the cap for a single person is €77 per week. Yet in the Western Health Board Area, just across the County Mayo border, the cap is €115 per week, a difference of €30. For a couple with one child or a one-parent family, the cap in the North-Western Health Board area is €115 per week. In the Western Health Board Area it is €175 per week.

The upshot is that tenants simply pay the higher rent—

For example, for a couple with one child in Sligo, the average going rate for a two-bedroom apartment is about €170, yet they only get €115 rent supplement. That means that the couple has to pay the extra €55 out of their own pocket. If a person is in receipt of rent supplement he or she does not have an extra €55 to throw around. Given that the rent is supposed to be €115, €55 is floating around which is not taxable. It is not accounted for and as legislators we are colluding in this. Something needs to be done.A realistic cap on rent supplement must be set because major difficulties are being created. If the Bill deals with the issue of market rent where landlords are setting or reviewing rent, similar parameters should be set when capping rent allowance. A number of Deputies have expressed concern at this concept of market rent and I share their concern. If it was linked  to the cap on rent or if those whose job it is to determine market rent could take account of the figures produced by the health board, perhaps it would help in some way. Those two issues, market rent and the capping of rent supplement, could be linked.Like Deputy Crawford and many other Deputies, I express my disappointment at the comments of the Taoiseach in this House on Wednesday regarding the position of one-off housing. When the Fianna Fáil Party came to Sligo, comments by the Taoiseach indicated the need for a change of heart by planners on the issue of rural housing. He told us this was the single most important issue raised by Deputies and Senators. All of us were led to believe we could look forward to a somewhat more liberal regime than heretofore. He signalled a radical shift in Government policy in relation to one-off housing when he said that current restrictions were too severe. Yet, in the House last Wednesday the Taoiseach said: "The means through which this can be done is by setting down guidelines under the spatial strategy for the limited areas where I and the Minister indicated it should be done to enable people who are siblings of landowners to build their houses on their own family farm."  Again, he said: "This was the limited area I mentioned."  He finished off his comments by saying:If the guidelines are set down, local authorities will co-operate with the Minister. That should be possible in this limited area.That comment is very strange because if one looks at the spatial strategy, launched by the Government recently, the section on rural generated housing states that rural generated housing needs arise for people who make up an intrinsic part of the rural community by way of background or the fact that they were full or part time in rural areas.That statement is much broader than the phrase "siblings of landowners". Nowhere in the Bill is it stated that they have to build on their own family farm. Did somebody get to the Taoiseach? What has happened in the meantime, because he appears to have narrowed down what is contained in the spatial strategy? The waters are muddied on the issue of rural housing. We need a definitive statement from Government on what are the issues because one Minister is saying one thing and the Taoiseach is saying another and rowing back on it. A legislative framework is needed to implement the spatial strategy.The Taoiseach spoke about guidelines. We are all familiar with the fact that various local authorities have not adhered to the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. The same can happen with the spatial strategy. If the Government is sincere about implementing the  strategy a legislative framework will have to be put in place. We are aware from a case in the High Court involving Meath County Council that the judge stated that even though it had not followed the planning guidelines, the fact that it had merely looked at the document was enough to say they were being referred to. In other words, the spatial strategy, without a legislative framework, does not need to be implemented.It is unfair of the Taoiseach to give the impression to many in rural Ireland who wish to live and work there that they will be able to do so and a few weeks later to pull the rug out from under them.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003. I give a broad welcome to the thrust of the Bill as we need to assist tenants in the wider society. My agenda in this debate is the advancement of tenants' rights. Given our history, the Irish will always want to put people's rights first, even though in the new consumer and materialistic society we seem to be losing respect for the valuable caring traditions of the past and the vision for equality. It is time to revisit the principles of people such as Michael Davitt which are still relevant. Perhaps we need to bring these compassionate principles into the debate. I intend to do so when dealing with the weaknesses in this legislation.The private rented sector is an important source of housing. Over 150,000 households are estimated to live in this sector. The long-term decline of the sector reversed during the 1990s, with 8% of all households housed in private rental accommodation at mid-decade, climbing to 12% of all households in more recent estimates. This dramatic shift reflects housing demands stemming from both population growth and the increase in household formation, neither of which is likely to abate soon. The issue of housing poverty is very real. Of those living in private rented accommodation, at least one third are in receipt of social welfare rent supplement and are living in the poorest quality accommodation, subjected to rent increases at will and liable to be evicted with only 28 days' notice for no cause. Although the conditions recall the Victorian era, it is reality for more than 100,000 people living on rent supplements and the countless others on the minimum wage of just under €13,000 per annum. This is their real world.Landlords who rent to those on low incomes know their tenants are unlikely to find alternative accommodation. Shopping around and voting with one's feet are not relevant options. Such landlords can, if they wish, exploit matters by ignoring the legitimate expectations of their tenants, such as meeting the minimum legal dwelling standards.The landlord's right to terminate a periodic  tenancy arbitrarily with only 28 days' notice and to raise the rent at will undermines the tenant's attempt to make a home for himself and his family. Effective regulation of landlord practices can help to protect these vulnerable tenants. I have strong views on this issue. The fact that contractual relations can reflect an equal power basis and, therefore, result in an unfair deal for one side is recognised in other policy areas. For example, workers are protected in many ways from exploitative treatment by employers. Consumers are protected by law from misleading or unfair conduct by suppliers. Surely it is time to protect tenants from the unfair practices used by a minority of landlords – I stress a minority of landlords because I have many positive stories from tenants about compassionate landlords in the trade.There is a real concern that the exclusion of licences, a non-exclusive right to occupy, from the scope of the Bill will lead to landlords using licence arrangements to avoid the Bill's requirements. I am concerned about abuses of the licensing system as it currently operates. I call on the Government to address this issue in legislative terms but, more specifically, I ask that the Residential Tenancies Bill be amended to enable the board to determine whether a licence arrangement is bone fide or designed to defeat a tenant's rights.The amount of money payable as a deposit has increased significantly in recent years. For many tenants, failure to get their deposit back speedily means real hardship and can prevent them from getting alternative accommodation. The Bill does not do enough to deal with this situation. As drafted, the Bill allows a landlord to retain the deposit if there are arrears of rent, even if the deposit amounts to significantly more money. It does not put an onus on the landlord to return a tenant's deposit promptly. While a tenant may go to the board for redress if the landlord withholds the deposit, unless the money is refunded quickly, homelessness is a real possibility. I call on the Government to increase the powers of the board to hold all tenant deposits and, therefore, avoid these hardships.For the first six months of a tenancy the landlord can give a 28 day notice to quit without cause. I consider this probationary period unduly long and recommend three months instead. Landlords should not be enabled unreasonably to refuse a sub-let or an assignment of a tenancy. Given the extended notice period required of tenants in the Bill, the ability to submit or assign would give some room to manoeuvre to tenants who have to vacate earlier than anticipated.The Bill should make it clear that its provisions cover bedsit dwelling units. Section 4, the interpretation section, defines a dwelling as a self-contained residential unit but Threshold is regularly  contacted by people living in bedsit accommodation who have landlord or tenant problems. The legislation should be amended to make clear that bedsits are covered by including a provision referring to units where bathrooms may be shared by occupants of different tenancies within a building. Otherwise people in bedsits would not have recourse to the private residential tenancies board for dispute resolution.Section 6, which deals with service of notices, provides that one means of service is by way of post. In my experience talking to tenants, ordinary prepaid post creates difficulties in terms of proof of receiving notices. The Bill should stipulate registered post, even though this imposes an extra cost, but the surest means of giving notice is by personal service, which I strongly support.Section 9 sets out the consequences of committing an offence. It provides a key incentive for landlords to comply with the Bill's registration requirements, which in turn is crucial to the effective implementation of many of the Bill's provisions. Section 9(2) sets a daily fine of €250 for each offence relating to continued contravention. This is less than the level set in other legislative measures such as the per diem in the Licensing of Indoor Events Act, 2003, which is €500. The daily fine in this Bill should be amended to at least €500.I am concerned that although the determination orders under this legislation essentially relate to civil disputes, the Bill provides in section 9 for criminal remedies, notably imprisonment, should the court find that an order has not been properly complied with. While section 123 exempts offenders of limited financial means from jail sentences, the issue of appropriate remedies still merits further consideration.Section 12 spells out the obligations of landlords and section 12(1) provides that the obligations created in section 12 are in addition to the obligations arising under any other enactment. However, the inference that section 18 of the 1992 Act and the 1993 standards regulations are part of a landlord's obligation will not be recognised by all those concerned. Compliance with minimum legal dwelling standards at the low price end of the rental market has been problematic and an express obligation in the Bill should help to improve matters. An amendment should make explicit the landlord's obligation to ensure that rental property complies with the minimum standards legislation as currently enacted, or as amended from time to time.There is no doubt that from the outside, the private rented sector does not have a very positive image. Research carried out by Threshold indicates that the negative perception of the sector is a significant deterrent to investment, particularly from financial institutions. A survey of landlords carried out by Threshold found that landlords themselves considered the perception  of the sector to be poor. I recognise that the reforms proposed in the Bill will bring about real change by improving the position of tenants and promoting greater professionalism within the sector. The Bill offers the prospect of a private rented sector where good practice is standard across the board and that is the key – it is good practice for the landlord and protection for the tenant. Proper regulation of the sector, together with enforcement of standards, will be in everyone's interest. An earlier speaker mentioned 150,000 people in the private rented sector, while 50,000 people are on the housing lists. That means in our society there are some people with a number of homes while other families have no homes at all. Something is wrong here which needs to be examined within our broader society. There were also challenges in less economically difficult times when past Governments had the ability to go out and look after those people. I hope the Government will take my views on board to enhance the Bill.

Reform of this sector is long overdue since the private renting population is in excess of 110,000, a sizeable constituency for any Government. The provision of adequate resources to educate tenants about their rights and obligations under the new legislation is vitally important, as well as ensuring the Bill's broad implementation. Until now it was difficult for local authorities to ensure enforcement due to a lack of resources, so sufficient resources should be provided to protect vulnerable students and other tenants and to prevent their exploitation.Registration of landlords is something the Bill has failed to grapple with. A minimum of landlords are registered – the figure is less than 25%, which shows that 75% of landlords are not registered, and I am sure it is the bigger landlords who are ignoring the registration system. While the Bill puts a legal onus on all landlords for the first time to register with the new private residential tenancies board, they are given an assurance of anonymity and a guarantee that they will not be registered with the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes. This amounts to a significant carrot to persuade landlords to co-operate. That board is a welcome development, principally due to its function as an independent dispute resolution body between landlords and tenants.In the past, student accommodation was fairly consistently substandard, with apparently scant regard for building or health and safety regulations, high inflated rents and no policing by any authority. In the past, security of tenure could only be obtained by tenants after spending 21  years in a property but this Bill means they will have achieved that after six months. However, that initial six months will make such tenants extremely vulnerable to unscrupulous landlords. Tenants have hitherto been subject to eviction after a mere four weeks' notice and their rights need to be copperfastened. Tenants are still subject to possible eviction by landlords. In effect, a loophole permits their eviction if a landlord expresses an intention to refurbish or sell the premises or to requisition the premises for the purposes of moving a family member into it. A block of apartments could be requisitioned by a landlord in this manner, which would still amount to blatant exploitation of his or her tenants. The tenants' rights need to be addressed in the legislation.The introduction of a once a year rent review limited to existing market rates is a further welcome development to protect tenants from excessive and unfair rent increases. However, certain criteria should be taken into account when sanctioning rent increases which should include the amount of the last increase, the landlord's costs in relation to the premises, the value and nature of any fixtures, appliances, etc., the state of repair of the premises and the value of work carried out by the tenant – at times the tenant takes a little pride in the rented premises, painting it or keeping the grass mown but he or she is charged what is almost a surtax by the landlord for keeping the premises in such excellent shape. We should also consider the hardship caused by a possible rent increase and the amount of time the tenant has occupied the premises. These issues should be considered in the annual review of rents.The stipulation that landlords will only be able to evict on limited grounds after six months and that tenants will have statutory protection for the following three and a half years is very welcome. However, I have a reservation regarding the possible compromising of the tenant's security of tenure by the suggestion by a landlord of anti-social behaviour and how this could be misused as an excuse for evicting a tenant. Ensuring the full registration of landlords will be a major task and non-registration of landlords would seriously undermine the effectiveness of the private residential tenancies board, which would only consider disputes involving registered tenants.This Bill is to be welcomed because it consolidates the rights of tenants and the capacity to have their rights enforced. Prior to this their rights were of little consequence. This Bill will go a long way towards improving their position by bringing about vastly improved standards in the private residential tenancy sector.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill which for the first time gives some element of security of tenure to  tenants. The legislation provides for a four-year renewable tenancy. The principle behind the legislation is positive and I hope that when it reaches Committee Stage the Minister will iron out some of the difficulties that have been raised in the House. The Bill is a positive development and it is imperative it is passed because there is an estimated 150,000 households living in this sector. The reason there are so many households in the sector – the number is increasing on an annual basis – is the huge demand for accommodation. A big shift or change in the family structure in the past ten or 15 years has led to the increased demand for housing units and accommodation. The Government must take some of the blame in this regard because we do not facilitate home ownership. In Dublin city the cost of purchasing even an apartment has gone beyond the reach of many families. They cannot even save enough for a deposit.The change has also led to huge problems in rural Ireland. I know the Minister of State's brother has tipped his hat to the idea of rural housing but in practice little has been done to address the rural housing issue. If the Minister wants an example of what should be done in regard to rural housing he should visit County Roscommon where there is no difficulty in regard to this issue. Under its county development plan it has a well balanced proposal which appears to work effectively.However, County Roscommon has other challenges leading to pressures in the private rented sector. This is because in the fastest growing area in rural Ireland, south County Roscommon, there is no sewerage scheme. Other than in the village of Monksland, bordering Athlone, there is no sewerage scheme in any of the villages in south County Roscommon. This places huge pressure on demands for rural housing and on private rented accommodation in Athlone, Ballinasloe and the other towns servicing the area. If the Government put sewerage facilities into villages it would help to reduce the demand for private rented accommodation and increase the availability of housing, thereby reducing the overall cost for many young couples who want to purchase their own houses, to which everyone aspires.The issue of development charges will arise in many of our local authorities in the coming months. My difficulty with these charges is that they are being passed on to house buyers, and in many cases this means young couples. Where a local authority adds development charges, ranging from a couple of thousand euro to €10,000 depending on the location and the type of house involved, the developer passes on the charge to the young couple purchasing the house. This makes accommodation even less affordable for this sector of the market. This is the reason we have had such an increase in private sector rented  accommodation in the 1990s and into the new millennium. There is an urgent need for this legislation so that people will have their basic rights protected.Part 3 of the Bill looks at rent and rent reviews. This is a step in the right direction and is a positive development. The Bill provides that the initial rent must be fixed at the market rate and for the first time a person will have a mechanism to appeal the rate when, subsequently, the tenancy is being renewed. We have seen that rent has gone down in some sectors, perhaps for a short period, but when a tenant looks for a review of his rent the landlord says he must either pay the rate charged or get out of the accommodation. Some element of flexibility must be built into the system and I am glad to see this being addressed in the legislation.The main reason I wanted to speak on the legislation concerns the registration of properties. As the Minister is aware, there are thousands of units of unregistered private rented accommodation. I am not so much concerned with the unregistered high quality units but with the large number of units that are let in which one would not house an animal. From experience of dealing with my local authority housing list I know there is competition to get that accommodation. It is like a merry-go-round. Tenants take this accommodation and then apply for rehousing to the local authority. The tenants spend 12 or 18 months in the accommodation, the local authority completes new housing stock lists, the housing officer looks at the accommodation, sees it is in atrocious condition and allocates a house to the tenants.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	231	It is a huge issue and I will come back to it. The person is allocated a house and I guarantee that within two months another tenant moves into the same accommodation and the merry-go-round starts again. It is soul destroying from a public representative point of view. Someone living in atrocious housing conditions is housed, yet people are back in the same situation again. I have raised this many times with my local authority. This happens not just in County Roscommon but throughout the country. The local authorities do not have the resources available to them to enforce the regulations.We see this in regard to our planning laws. In talking to some enforcement officers over the past few days I heard that the first area the staffing cutbacks affected this year was the  planning enforcement section of local authorities. We know from the proposals regarding benchmarking that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not prepared to make funding available through the local authority sector. More staff will be laid off and again the enforcement area will be the first to be cut. It is hugely frustrating to see what is going on in regard to poor quality housing and to see people competing for it to get a higher priority on the local authority housing list.There is another problem which the Minister has a responsibility to address. People have come from Dublin to rural Ireland under rural resettlement schemes, other schemes or on their own. Apart from a rare exception, most of those people have settled well into their new communities and caused no difficulty. They have become an integral part of the community. We have no difficulty with people coming from any part of the country or the world. County Roscommon has one of the most multi-ethnic populations and there have never been any problems in regard to racism, which we hear about in other parts of the country.Another huge problem I come across is people coming from Dublin and buying houses in rural areas. Some of them have released the mortgage on their properties and have cash to invest in their new purchase. Others are facilitated by means of loans from credit unions or family members. In some cases, such people have bought houses only to find out them uninhabitable.For example, a couple from Dublin bought a house in the country but the previous tenant had been rehoused by Roscommon County Council because the house had been declared unfit for human habitation due to its being prone to flooding. Four years later, the couple awoke on Christmas morning to discover four inches of water in the house after the River Shannon burst its banks. On two occasions the couple raised the floor level of the house but it has still been flooded. In another case, a person bought a house with nothing but a galvanised sheet over a hole as a septic tank.In these cases, people subsequently fall back on the local authority housing list. Since the money for the purchases of these houses is, in many cases, not being sourced through a bank, the purchasers do not have the benefit of the bank's insistence on a engineer's assessment which would normally highlight many of these issues. In one of the cases to which I referred, no engineer was involved because the purchasers had cash and, in the other case, a broker in a financial institution facilitated the mortgage, although no proper assessment was carried out.It is extremely frustrating to see these people return to local authority housing lists. We have enough difficulty housing people who are in genuinely poor conditions, particularly in a county like Roscommon where there is a high dependency ratio. However, people are coming into the county, purchasing houses in good faith and ending up in this situation. Mechanisms and facilities should be put in place to ensure this does not happen, whether through Rural Resettlement Ireland or some other agency of the Department. We do not want people going back into the private rented sector or coming back on the local authority housing lists. Many people are trying to buy rural property to get out of Dublin, which in turn releases housing stock in Dublin, all of which the Minister of State must see as a positive step, yet those people are coming back on the housing lists.A facility to ensure such individuals do not buy a pig in a poke would not require a great deal of resources and should be seriously considered, either through funding an independent agency or providing resources within the Minister of State's Department.

I have serious concerns about the level of enforcement in that regard. I agree with the general thrust of this Bill in principle, although there may be some technical issues about which we could argue. However, it is pointless bringing forward this or any other Bill and our spending time debating it in the House, on Committee Stage and through the Seanad, if we do not ensure that resources are committed to its enforcement. I have given a number of examples where the sector is being abused and I hope the Minister will ensure such resources are put in place.According to Part 6 of the Bill, during the initial six months of the tenancy the landlord is free to terminate it without giving a reason. This is extremely harsh and the protection should be strengthened. A landlord should say why he or she proposes to terminate an agreement or tenancy. It is pointless to introduce legislation, the objective of which is to provide security of tenancy over a period up to four years, and then introduce so many conditions that someone who wants to abuse the system will find enough loopholes to get out.The provision allowing the landlord to reclaim a property for justifiable reasons such as for their  own or family occupation, sale, change of use or major refurbishment, basically gives the landlord the opportunity to get out of the tenancy at any time because the reason will be impossible to verify. The landlord could tell the tenant that his daughter is starting college and he wants to refurbish the apartment so that she can reside there for the next four years. The tenant may be given notice to quit and leave on this basis only to find that the landlord has the property advertised for rental again. Will the Minister of State elaborate on how he sees this being secured so that it will not be abused? I have concerns that it will be abused and we will not have the necessary resources for enforcement.A fine of €3,000 and/or imprisonment of up to six months is provided for but this is pointless unless there is enforcement. For far too long I have seen legislation go through this House from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others, the key elements of which are enforcement, and the opposite happens, as is the case with the penalty points system.The Minister of State received a weighty submission from Threshold, which I do not intend to read out since the Minister of State has already heard it a number of times today. The definition of "anti-social behaviour" seems to be unclear. I ask that the Government examines it on Committee Stage to see if it could be strengthened in order that specifics will be spelled out. It can be difficult for landlords since there are plenty of cases in where the landlord needs more protection than the tenant, particularly where tenants are abusing the properties they are occupying.For example, a group of students was living in a semi-detached house whose friends were in the house next door and they decided to bore a hole in the wall between the properties. In that case, the landlord had no contact name and address for the students when they left and was left, with his neighbour, to foot the bill. That notwithstanding, we do not want to see the landlords abusing the provisions either. Strict criteria need to be applied.It is important also that we lay down specific standards which should apply to different types of accommodation to ensure that, for example, landlords do not paint over damp walls and the wallpaper falls off two weeks after the tenants have signed a lease and are left in deplorable conditions, even if they are not looking for that type of accommodation. There is a big demand for accommodation because we are not addressing the housing waiting list. I ask the Minister to consider new measures to address this issue.

My Department is currently engaged in the estimates campaign with the Department of Finance which will determine the resources available, both capital and current, for the education sector. I will have to allocate the available funding on the basis of priority policies which can only be determined when the funding for 2004 for my Department is decided.I am fully appreciative of the importance of developing the research infrastructure in the higher education sector to enable a successful transition to the knowledge society, which has been identified as the key strategic objective for Ireland's future economic and social prosperity. The establishment of the programme for research in third level institutions by the Government was informed by that strategic imperative and the Government remains committed to it. Since 1999, €160 million of public Exchequer funding, current and capital, has been directly expended on PRTLI projects. The total capital and current funding value of projects approved for inclusion under the three cycles of the programme, taking account of private sector contributions, is €605 million. The investment that has been made to date has had a transforming impact on the development of research capacity, in fostering a culture of research excellence and in promoting inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaboration on an unprecedented scale across the Irish higher education sector. To date, 17 out of a planned 33 research centres have been completed and some 1,600 research positions are supported under the PRTLI.Our national research effort is an ongoing one. We have set ourselves a long-term goal in terms of our percentage of GDP spend on research and development by 2010. The Government will continue to keep that goal in sight, even if progress  towards it has to be slowed in a period of tight public expenditure policy constraints.As Minister for Education and Science, I have to balance a number of highly sensitive and immediate issues to which an appropriate priority has to be afforded. Equally I understand that real sustainable progress on all fronts is only possible if we can achieve the social and economic growth that will flow in the longer term from continuing investment in research and knowledge.

Is he aware of the comments of the chief executive of the Higher Education Authority who has contacted the five universities, including the Royal College of Surgeons, to regret the serious implications of the Government's response to funding? We spent the last fortnight attending the Joint Committee on Education and Science discussing the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. Will the Minister confirm or deny whether schools of nursing being built at some of the universities will be affected by this decision and that the universities are saying some projects cannot continue? This includes training facilities for nurses, occupational therapists, speech therapists and social workers. There is little point in passing an Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill if we do not appoint extra speech therapists or occupational therapists to carry out the work. Will the Minister confirm whether this is the case?The Minister referred to a pause in funding. Will he indicate what he means by a pause? Is a pause something that just happened in the Estimates one year, will it be repeated in the Estimates for this year or has he any idea of his intentions in this regard at this time?

I will not make predictions as to what might happen, but the Deputy appears to be confusing two separate issues. I understood the question was about the programme for research in third level institutions. The wider question of the third level capital programme is a separate one. I can confirm to the Deputy that no projects that have started will be stopped. We have contractual commitments which will be honoured. These include the occupational therapy area where a number of courses have begun this year.The overall level of expenditure for the PRTLI in 2004 will depend on the financial circumstances during 2004. This will be decided during the Estimates process. I hope to have some funding avail able for the PRTLI. I also hope cycle 3 of the programme will be completed over the next five years. However, we must await the Estimates process to finalise it.

Schools of nursing being built at some universities are covered by the programme for research in third level institutions. Does the Minister not think we are currently in an absurd situation whereby Science Foundation Ireland is continuing to fund researchers, that researchers are still being employed and have contractual commitments to universities, those universities have to meet those contractual commitments, yet there is no physical laboratory space for these people? Does he not think it is a waste of resources to be paying people to do a job while they are not being provided with either the space or equipment needed to do the job?

As a result, 800 researchers are being funded, including 540 postgraduate researchers and 272 postdoctoral researchers. There has been a very significant increase in the number of non-national researchers employed under the programme, which will continue into the future.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	240	It is important that I begin by reiterating that I and my Government colleagues remain fully committed to ensuring that victims of abuse are helped to find peace and healing in their lives and that those responsible for abuse are held accountable. Furthermore, in order for the final report of the commission to be relevant to survivors and for it to assist them in reaching some form of closure, it is important that the work of the commission be concluded and its final report produced within a reasonable timeframe.In relation to the issues raised by the Deputy, I regret that Ms Justice Laffoy reached the conclusion that she could no longer continue as chairperson of the Commission to Inquire Into Child Abuse. I have previously stated that Ms Justice Laffoy's decision to resign her position as chairperson of the commission was a matter of considerable surprise to the Government and me. I have also acknowledged and expressed my thanks to her for her commitment. Ms Justice Laffoy remains as chairperson of the commission until the publication of an interim report by the commission which is expected in November 2003.Ms Justice Laffoy's letter of 2 September 2003 to the Government, in which she indicated that she intended to resign upon publication of an interim report by the commission in November, contained a number of reasons she considered she had to take such a course of action. The Government considered Ms Justice Laffoy's letter and issued its response to the matters that had been raised by Ms Justice Laffoy on 9 September 2003. In addition, it published correspondence with the commission dating back to December 2002 and the announcement of the review of the commission.I do not intend to reproduce here the contents of Ms Justice Laffoy's letter or the Government's response to it. The documents have been made publicly available and are a matter of public record. They were discussed at length in the House yesterday and at the committee on Monday.While I accept that the review process created some uncertainty for the commission, it was in order to counteract that uncertainty that at regular intervals Ms Justice Laffoy was advised of the progress of the review and indeed the commission gave much useful assistance. Furthermore, Ms Justice Laffoy attended meetings on 9 May 2003 and 15 July 2003 with the Attorney General and myself at which discussions took place regarding the second phase of the review of the operations of the commission. At no time during these meetings did Ms Justice Laffoy give an indication that she considered the ongoing review grounds for her resignation.With regard to the plans for the future operation of the commission, the Government recently announced the appointment of a new chairperson designate Mr. Seán Ryan, SC. Mr. Ryan will undertake his own review of the commission, which I expect to be completed within eight weeks. In carrying out this review, Mr. Ryan will take account of the interests of victims of abuse, the need for the commission to complete its work within a reasonable timescale and in a manner consistent with a proper investigation, without incurring exorbitant costs.While nobody would have wished for events to take the course they have, it is important to focus on the future rather than the past. In this regard  I remain committed to ensuring that the process of review will be completed as quickly as possible and that appropriate amending legislation will be enacted which will allow for the completion of the work of the investigation committee within a reasonable timeframe and without incurring exorbitant costs.

Will the Minister issue a clarifying statement to survivors of abuse because there is a great deal of confusion among the public based on contacts I have had? The Minister has not satisfactorily answered why he did not go ahead with the provision of additional resources following the first review last February. The commission felt a specific number of additional staff would be provided but that did not happen because there was a second review. Will the Minister give a commitment that resources will be supplied in future to the commission to bring its work to a timely conclusion? Will he consult all groups, including Irish SOCA, and individuals and listen to their views on this issue because there is a feeling that a number of people have been excluded from the discussions?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind regarding a clarifying statement. Perhaps if she speaks to me afterwards about it, we can reach an agreement. I have no difficulty, where there is doubt or where victims have been upset, issuing a clarifying statement reassuring them that the commission will continue, the legislation is still in place, the chairman designate is in place and will take over immediately from Ms Justice Laffoy and there will be no difficulties during the transition.Ms Justice Laffoy sought additional resources in June 2002, including an increase in staff from 38 to 79. That was the subject of discussions with my Department until November. I brought the matter to the Government's attention when we were satisfied the additional staff and the method in which they would be deployed would be helpful. The Government agreed in principle and we conveyed same to Ms Justice Laffoy. We suggested to her that she should be mindful of the fact that we were conducting a review and she should consider recruiting staff on short-term contracts or roll them out over a period.

This project is at stage 3 of architectural planning, which means that the outline sketch scheme has been further developed and cost proposals for the project submitted for consideration. It has been assigned a band 2 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. This project, with other projects listed in sections 6 and 7, will not be authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning at this time.Budgetary provisions in 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progression to tender and construction of these projects in conjunction with the band rating individually assigned. In the meantime, individual schools should, as appropriate, use their devolved grant to deal with urgent health and safety works.

Approximately 300 pupils attend the school and it has 16 teachers. Does he agree the toilet facilities installed in that four classroom school are not adequate? There is no access to the school for children with disabilities. The school was given a greenfield site by Clarecastle hurling club and there must be an onus on the Government to honour the commitment that was made. Does the Minister accept his predecessor made such a commitment? Why is he reneging on it?

A number of other schools need to be provided with additional accommodation or new buildings but that can only be done within the available budget and within our priorities. I guarantee the Deputy the school will be dealt with fairly, openly and transparently. When I know how much I have for the 2004 school building programme, the information will be updated on the website and the list will be circulated to Members. I assure the Deputy no school will jump the queue.

Who is responsible if children get injured or contract a disease because of the poor toilet facilities in the school? There is an onus on the Department to give this case more urgent attention rather than saying it will be examined and considered in 2004. That is not good enough. I ask the Minister to give this urgent case priority.  The population of Clarecastle is increasing and a proper building should accommodate at least 100 more pupils, particularly given the difficulty of getting children into schools in Ennis because of overcrowding. The Minister's programme is in a shambles.

I can only make provision on the basis of my allocation. I stand over my firm undertaking that schools will be dealt with in order of priority.Health and safety issues are a matter for the board of management of the school in the first instance. If the issues are of such a serious nature that they cannot be addressed using the devolved grant or the capitation grant, the board can make a case to the Department to be dealt with under the emergency provisions that we make.The issue of prefabricated classrooms comes up constantly. I do not agree with what has been said. I do not think the pupils in the school would choose not to avail of a modern prefabricated structure while they wait for their new school to be finished. If such a structure is necessary, it is necessary. If the Department is not in a position to provide a new school, the provision of temporary accommodation in such a form is far better than leaving pupils to tolerate the difficulties they were experiencing.

It is intended that the plan will be implemented on a phased and prioritised basis as resources permit, following agreement on financial provisions with the Minister for Finance. The plan includes a significant number of proposed actions, of which five have been identified as priorities by the national youth work advisory committee. The priorities are the appointment of an assessor of youth work, the establishment of a development unit for youth work, the establishment of a funding review body, the establishment of a validation body for youth work training and the commencement of a  national programme for child protection training for the youth work sector.The appointment of an assessor of youth work and the commencement of a comprehensive child protection training programme have been identified as priorities in the first year of the plan. Funding of €120,000 is available in 2003 for these priorities. Further consideration will be given to the remaining priorities and actions in the light of the financial provisions made available in 2004 and subsequent years. Annex 4 of the plan outlines the total financial implications for each year of the plan if every action is implemented in line with the specified timetable. The amounts involved are as follows: €2,650,300 in 2003, €4,477,700 in 2004, €7,568,900 in 2005, €9,831,980 in 2006 and €12,443,985 in 2007. The total amount is €36,972,865. Sustaining Progress provides, "Based on the Youth Work Act, 2001, the National Youth Work Development Plan will be progressed and implemented on a phased basis, as resources are made available."

The national youth work development plan was initiated and many people were consulted for that reason. The four broad goals that were set out are being pursued by the Government. Like other areas of policy, this matter has to be pursued within the confines of the available public finances.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I assure teachers and parents that the basic purposes of circular 24/03 are to ensure that applications for resource teacher and special needs assistant support are processed as efficiently as possible and to ensure that such resources are targeted to best effect on an ongoing basis.Priority has been given to the 780 applications in respect of new entrant children. Following a review of the supporting documentation submitted, the applicant schools have been given allocations where appropriate. The allocations have been given on a temporary basis initially, pending an examination in due course of the level of resources already made available to the schools. The remaining 4,700 applications will be processed by a dedicated team of inspectors and psychologists. Every effort will be made to issue a response as early as possible during the current school year. A census of pupils in primary schools with special educational needs and associated resources is being conducted. The data will enable the team to consider the applications in the context of the existing level of resources available to each school.Significant additional resources have been allocated to schools since 1999 when an automatic response to support pupils with special educational needs was introduced. Over 2,300 resource teachers and almost 5,500 full and part-time special needs assistants have been employed. The number of learning support teachers now stands at 1,531, which means that a learning support service can be accessed by every primary school pupil in the country. I am determined to  ensure that this considerable investment is deployed as effectively and flexibly as possible.The circular highlights a number of practical strategies with that aim in mind, geared at assisting schools with existing resource allocations. If possible, schools should provide additional help for pupils with special educational needs in the mainstream classroom or, if necessary, in small groups. Schools are encouraged to develop strategies that draw on the skills of all such teachers without making artificial distinctions between them, bearing in mind the various categories of special education teachers deployed in the education system, including resource, learning support and visiting teachers. While resource teacher allocations have been approved on the basis of individual applications, the overriding principle is that resources should be deployed in the manner that best meets the needs of pupils with special educational needs. Before applying for additional special needs assistants, schools should review their existing allocations to see whether an identified need can be met by redeploying available resources. Where appropriate, principals may deploy individual special needs assistants to support several pupils, perhaps in more than one classroom.I emphasise that circular 24/03 does not propose a cut in resources for pupils with special educational needs. Schools will appreciate that the level of approved resources is not immutable, however, as account must be taken of the progress of individual pupils with special educational needs and of the departure from the school of such pupils. It is expected that schools will notify the Department of instances where resources have become surplus to requirements so they can be redeployed as necessary. The purpose of circular 24/03 is to provide clarity regarding special needs resource allocation. It also encourages schools to deploy resources in a flexible manner.

There are particular problems when children transfer from primary to secondary level. Does the Minister agree with the disability groups that claim that this is, in effect, a significant cut in the learning supports available to children with special educational needs? Does the Minister agree that this decision flies in the face of the provisions of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2003, which has a child centred approach? The application of the circular seems to represent a move in the opposite direction and not a focus on the needs of the individual child.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I am aware of, and I very much regret, the delay in the allocation of resources for special needs pupils. The Depart ment made a great effort over the summer to try to streamline the system for that reason and this circular is a further attempt in that regard. It is regrettable that we were not in a position to have special needs assistants in place at the beginning of the year. That is why we focused on children who were going into school for the first time. A level of resources exists in schools at present because special needs assistants were employed some time ago for pupils who have since passed through the system and those special needs assistants have remained in the schools. We must ensure that we put a system in place so that it will be known very early if a child who has special needs is attending school, whether primary or secondary, and facilities can be made available for him or her. That is why we are trying to streamline the system.Given the figures I have quoted, it is nonsense to say there has been a cut. This area has grown exponentially. Approximately 11,000 adults are catering for special needs in the schools system. Between teachers, resource teachers and capital funding we have been spending approximately €300 million per year on special needs. I do not accept that there has been a cut or that we are flying in the face of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. We are trying to ensure that those who have genuine needs have those needs met efficiently, effectively, quickly and as early as possible so that they can make the necessary arrangements. That is all that is involved in this.I do not want a continuation of the current system where parents must wait so long to know what facilities their child will get in school. I know the Deputy does not want it and neither do the groups representing people with disabilities or the parents of children with special needs. I want to move from that. Part of the purpose of circular SP ED 24/03 is to get to an acceptable situation. Some pain will be involved in doing this while also processing applications. I have no doubt that will cause some difficulties for parents but the end result, a good streamlined system where these needs can be met efficiently and well, is worth fighting for.

In the past the regulations have not been applied at the appropriate level. There has been no change in the criteria for eligibility for special needs assistants in schools.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	260	The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 was fully commenced on 5 July 2002. It established the National Educational Welfare Board on a statutory basis as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. It appointed an interim chief executive officer in August 2002. Directors of corporate services and educational services, with a further eight head office staff, were appointed earlier this year. Thirty-seven former school attendance officers who were employed under the previous legislation were transferred to the board in July, 2002 in accordance with section 40 of the Act. To date, 25 have accepted, in full, the terms and conditions of the new grade of education welfare officer. The remaining school attendance officers are continuing to carry out the duties which they performed under the previous legislation.An additional cohort of 36 service delivery staff, including regional managers, senior education welfare officers and education welfare officers, are currently being recruited. Interviews have recently been completed and it is anticipated that all appointees will be in place by the end of the year. The additional cohort will bring the total number of staff in the board to 84 by the end of this year.The new services are being phased in and my Department has allocated a budget of €5.4 million to the board for 2003 for this purpose. Five regional teams will be established in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff will be deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. A service will also be provided in all cases where children have been permanently excluded from education. I have instructed officials of my Department to work with the board to ensure that all opportunities for integrated working between education welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element are exploited to the maximum.The board has commenced a round of consultations with schools, teachers, parents and others  in regard to its services and has recently established a school implementation group to advise on its working arrangements with schools. A letter giving general information on the service was issued to all schools last February and the board will follow this up with more detailed information shortly.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The National Educational Welfare Board is still hopelessly under-resourced to carry out its statutory duty to address the problem of school drop-outs throughout the country. When does the Minister expect to have education welfare officers in place for every part of the country?Representatives of school principals told the Joint Committee on Education and Science that they were seriously concerned about the operation of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill because they had statutory duties under the Education (Welfare) Act which they could not properly undertake because the resources were not in place. Will the Minister respond to the serious concern expressed by school principals that there is a hiatus in terms of responsibility for children who drop out of school? These are the most vulnerable in our education system.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	262	The legislation is very clear. The National Educational Welfare Board has responsibility for that. The board is moving to place education welfare officers throughout the country. There are centres in Green Street in Dublin and in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. Those offices will be located in premises that are in the process of becoming health board regional offices. A staff of 45 will be based in Dublin to serve Dublin, north Leinster, Ulster and south Leinster, 15 will be based in Cork, eight in Galway, three in Limerick and two in Waterford.Other people who are working with children from disadvantaged backgrounds will continue their work and the National Educational Welfare Board should work closely with them. There are 369 home-school liaison co-ordinators and these are based almost exclusively in disadvantaged areas. There are 82 co-ordinators in the school completion programme and 40 visiting teachers for Travellers. These all deal with disadvantage. We recently organised a meeting between Department officials, the NEWB and representatives of these groups to ensure that they work closely together until the board is fully in place.

The Minister mentioned that the staff in Dublin will serve north Leinster and south Leinster but there is no service currently.Will the Minister comment on the statement by the chief executive of the board, "We are not in a position to follow up on reports of student absences in areas where staff are not yet appointed."  The Garda has had no role in school attendance since July 2002. What is a school principal to do in any of the 21 counties where there is no service?

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The total annual amount paid in respect of fee charging secondary schools for each of the past five years amounted to €66 million in 1999, €69 million in 2000, €72 million in 2001, €77.5 million in 2002 and an estimated €83.5 million in 2003. Of this sum, almost 90% relates to salaries and allowances of teachers. The balance includes the Protestant block grant and funding towards support services such as secretarial and caretaking services. Grants were issued in 2002 and 2003 for supervision arrangements.The payment of teacher salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee charging schools which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions. Teachers in fee charging schools, irrespective of the denominational ethoi of those schools, are paid by the State. This may well reflect a long standing pragmatism to the effect that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme.There are 59 fee charging second level schools in the country, of which one is Jewish, 21 Protestant, two inter-denominational and the balance  Catholic. The Protestant and Jewish schools receive funding by way of a block grant which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant and Jewish persuasion to attend schools that reflect their denominational ethoi. The block grant includes payments in respect of capitation and these schools also qualify for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant and secretarial and caretaking grants. Fee charging schools not embraced by the block grant do not qualify for payment of capitation or related supports.State funding of fee charging schools is complex. In many respects the present system has evolved over time as opposed to its having been rationally planned. That said, we all know that suggestions of change can all too often be seen as threatening and run the risk of being presented in a black and white or winners and losers way. The reality is different. Fee charging schools are not all of a kind. The spectrum of fees charged varies considerably and, in some cases, scholarships are provided. Enrolments in schools in receipt of a Protestant block grant can increasingly include a significant number of pupils from other denominations. Just as the issues are complex, securing change will be equally complex. I have no proposals for a grandstanding or headline setting measure such as the total removal of all State support. Equally, we should not accept the existing arrangements as either ideal or unchangeable. As a first step, I have asked my officials to explore some of the issues involved with representatives of schools in the fee charging sector.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The Minister has given us an interesting outline of the issue but he has not answered my question as to what proposals he has to review the existing funding arrangements. Is it that he just wanted to sound as if he were concerned about disadvantage and spending a significant sum of money on fee charging schools? What will the Minister do to address the problems that exist?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I have often been accused of saying what I will do before giving anybody the opportunity to express their views. Therefore, I will not be drawn into the argument of the Deputy.I have raised the matter with the JMB as a representative of the management of the schools. I have asked my officials to examine some of the issues involved and to report back to me. When they do so, I will consider the matter further.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Is there a timescale pertaining to when the proposals will be put forward?

Will he tell us what they are? He was asked on a radio programme if fee charging schools should join the free education scheme. He said it would put the building programme up the creek. Is he still of that opinion?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I would not use unparliamentary language like that in the House. Not only would the schools joining the free education scheme cause major problems for the capital programme but it would also cause problems for my current programme because none of the schools in question, with the exception of those associated with the Protestant block grant, receives a capitation grant. If they were to be subject to the free education scheme, we would have to pay capitation grants, which would cost approximately €60 million. Bearing this in mind, I would still prefer to have them all included in the free education scheme. The day of private schools may be over and they should all be treated equally.On the issues Deputy Enright raised, there are issues of constitutionality and school size. For instance, a case was put to me by a Church of Ireland clergyman that, even within the Church of Ireland system, there are quite distinct differences between some of the fee charging schools and others. He listed one or two schools in Dublin – I will not name them – that could well afford not to be receiving State support. However, the vast majority of Church of Ireland schools are in rural areas and cater for a scattered Protestant population. Their not receiving State support would cause them great difficulties. These are the kinds of complex issues that are involved.As the Deputy knows, the issue of constitutionality also arises. We have a commitment to look after minorities and one way by which churches feel their ethoi are preserved is if they have their own schools. There are very complex issues to be considered but I still believe it would be useful if all such schools made provision for pupils from backgrounds other than wealthy backgrounds to attend those schools. That is not because I deem these schools to be any better than the free schools. It is not good to have people from just one socio-economic background clustered together in a school. There should be pupils from diverse backgrounds in attendance.

Does he not agree that the need for a Protestant block grant underlines the perception that the education system is still dominated in large part by a Catholic ethos which, if the opinion polls are to be believed, is not shared by a growing proportion of the population? Does  he not agree that we need schools in which all denominations are respected equally? Will he proactively assist groups such as the Educate Together schools, which need assistance from his Department?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Educate Together schools and those of a non-denominational nature, like all others, are treated equally in the system. We have a constitutional obligation to ensure that this be the case. The question of the Protestant schools and the block grant arose when the free secondary education system was introduced. It was deemed to be a way of discharging our constitutional obligations but, as far as I am concerned, all schools are treated equally within the system and I hope that this continues to be the case.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	277	It is my policy that all teachers working with children with special educational needs will have relevant training and continuing professional development. In this regard, the existing full-time pre-service primary teacher training courses in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special educational needs.At second level, there are inputs into both the higher diploma in education and the education degree programmes in the University of Limerick, as part of a general alertness orientation programme, on the variety of learning difficulties pupils may have.There has been a major increase in recent years in the level of additional teaching resources made available by my Department to schools to assist them in catering for children with special educational needs. My Department has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of teachers working with these children. Specifically, it involves a major expansion of the range of postgraduate professional training programmes; the introduction of a range of new training programmes to provide a mix of intensive induction training and more advanced training in specific areas; and the establishment of a new special education support service. This service will consolidate and co-ordinate existing inservice provision at local level for personnel working with children with special educational needs. It will explore various models of inservice and support for teachers in the classroom and will also work co-operatively with col leges of education and other agencies to maximise the effects of training and support across the spectrum.

Does he also agree that specific modules should be available at primary and higher diploma training levels to ensure that teachers have the necessary skills? This point was made in the presentation to us today on the Education for Persons with Disability Bill.Does the Minister have concerns that there is no extra training for teachers who work as special needs teachers as distinct from in mainstream classes? They must prepare education plans and so on for these students and in view of this, does he not consider that they should be provided with greater and more specific training?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I agree with the Deputy that the more of this education and training that is available, the better. We have some catching up to do following the Government's decision in 1998 on an automatic response to special needs. There was not much in place at that time.In the current year, five institutions are running postgraduate courses in special needs education. These are Saint Patrick's College, the Church of Ireland training college located in Rathmines, Saint Angela's College in Sligo, UCD and Mary Immaculate College. A total of 160 places are provided. A postgraduate professional programme in autism is provided in Saint Patrick's Training College in association with the University of Birmingham. Thus far, 75 teachers have participated in it. Some 25 places are allocated to each course. There is a nationwide postgraduate programme in learning support in six colleges-universities. These include Saint Patrick's College, the Church of Ireland training college, St. Angela's College, Mary Immaculate College and NUI, Galway and Cork. There are 25 places per college, with a total of 150 places overall.The second element of the strategy is the induction introduction programmes for resource teachers, which are provided at Saint Patrick's College, the Church of Ireland training college, Saint Angela's College and Mary Immaculate College. Two to three induction courses are available for teachers who are working with children with severe and profound learning disabilities. Deputy Enright is concerned with making these courses available on a more mainstream basis within teacher training. I support that and we are in consultation with the colleges. It is an optional module, but there is perhaps a need for it to be more mainstream at this stage.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	280	Does the Minister agree that disability issues are widespread, covering people with hearing and visual difficulties and so on?  Does he have any plans to increase disability awareness among the general teaching profession in all schools by perhaps bringing forward disability awareness training programmes for all teachers to ensure they are conscious of the needs of people with disabilities? Will he outline the format of the autism programme to which he referred? Does it include TEACH, ABA and so on and is the Minister satisfied that if only one programme is followed others will not be excluded?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I do not have details of the specifics of the course to which the Deputy referred, but I understand it covers autism generally and the possible responses to it. I am not completely sure, but I understand it is not based on ABA or TEACH specifically but is more general in its treatment of autism.On the question of a course for all teachers, we have established the education support service. Part of its brief is to manage and co-ordinate the management of inservice in the areas of special education, to liaise with all the relevant bodies and to give support to the schools and so on. The headquarters for the service are in Laois Education Centre. Many services delivered by education centres are conscious of the needs of teachers. I have no doubt that the kind of service referred to by the Deputy is, and will be, made available by education centres throughout the country. However, at present there is no formal course for all teachers.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	282	Does the Minister agree that all class teachers require some training at this stage, especially in view of the document, Circular SP ED 24/03, we discussed earlier? Its appendix outlines a staged approach to special educational needs. The first stage requires the class teacher to administer screening measures and to then draw up a short simple plan for extra help within the normal classroom setting where there is a problem with the child. A variety of special needs are listed. Does the Minister agree that under the proposed changes he has circularised to the national schools, it will be a requirement of ordinary class teachers to have a significant level of expertise in this area?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Stanton. The more teachers who have training, or at least an increased awareness, in this area the better. Over the past years a considerable number of inservice courses have been provided by the Department and undertaken by a number of teachers. I pay tribute to those who have participated in them. A range of shorter courses were available to teachers in the special needs area which would serve the purpose referred to by the Deputies. They are delivered through the education centres, especially for primary teachers, through the summer months.Four e-learning courses for teachers were provided on a pilot basis during July and August this year which dealt with the areas of autism, dyslexia, inclusion and ADHD. They were delivered on-line and more than 900 teachers availed of them. I accept that there is a need for this and it is fair to say that teachers also accept this. They are trying to participate in such courses and we are trying to provide them. The special education support service will co-ordinate much of the activities in this area from here on and I have no doubt that the new council for special education needs will go into this aspect in detail. Part of its brief will be to ensure that with regard to the special needs of people in this area, there is sufficient training, induction, awareness raising and so on.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The indemnity agreement provided that the property contribution of the congregations was to be divided into two separate and distinct parts. One was property to be transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations after the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002. The value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be €36.54 million.The other part was property transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations between 11 May 1999 and the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002. The value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be €40.32 million.It is not the case however that the property aspect of the indemnity agreement was to be completed by 30 April 2003. Under the terms of the agreement signed on 5 June 2002 the State had a period of nine months to consider the properties offered by the religious congregations in respect of the "properties to be transferred" list.On 5 March 2003, officials at the residential institutions redress unit of my Department requested a further period of two months to give further consideration to a number of the proper ties on offer. CORI agreed to this request. Following further examination of the properties on offer, officials at my Department informed CORI's legal representatives that the State was prepared in principle to accept a fee simple interest in 34 of the properties offered. These properties have been valued by the congregations at €22.6 million. As indicated previously, the target amount for this schedule is €36.54 million. Eight other properties were rejected on the basis that no benefit to the State could be identified by acquiring a title. Three properties are still under consideration.Section 8 of the agreement states that in the event that the State party rejects a property offered, the religious congregation has the right to replace the property with an alternative property or cash sum equivalent. CORI has submitted a schedule of alternative properties which the congregations propose to offer the State in place of the properties it has declined. These are being considered by officials at my Department to establish if any benefit will accrue to the State by accepting them. My Department will respond to the offer of these properties in the near future.As negotiations are ongoing and the issue is commercially sensitive, I do not intend giving details of the identity of the properties concerned at this stage. When agreement is reached, a list of the properties will be made available.There is not a time limit of nine months on the schedule entitled "properties already transferred". Officials from my Department have sought additional information from CORI to ensure that each of these properties qualifies under the criteria laid down in the indemnity agreement regarding valuation, title and restriction on transfer for a 25 year period. To date none of the properties on this list has been accepted.I share the Deputy's concern about having the property aspect of the indemnity agreement concluded as soon as possible. However, my paramount concern is that the State only accepts properties that will provide a material benefit. In addition to this I must ensure that properties the congregations maintain were transferred to the State, State bodies or voluntary organisations qualify in accordance with the terms of the indemnity agreement.

Has he accepted the properties and does he consider them to be of value to the State? Will he proceed with their transfer and what does he consider will be the timescale?The Minister said at the Committee on Education and Science that if he did not receive suitable properties up to the value, he could obtain the value in cash. Will he clarify whether he can  do that under the terms of the deal? Is a timescale involved or can the congregations continue to offer properties during the nine months? Will the Minister clarify the position in this regard?

We are carrying out due diligence to ensure that the titles are clear, there are no encumbrances and that no one else has a hold on the properties.Section 8 of the indemnity deal states that in the event that the State rejects a property, the religious have the right to replace it with an alternative property or a cash sum equivalent. They have exercised that right, so it is one or the other. The indemnity agreement means that so long as both sides act in good faith, there is not much we can do except finalise negotiations.If at some stage the State believes the congregations are not entering into the negotiations in good faith, for example, there is provision for us to go to an arbitrator. If they were to continue to provide properties that they knew were not acceptable, the State could go to arbitration. However, I am informed that from a legal viewpoint, we would want to be sure they were not serious. Nonetheless, we have that alternative and if at the end there is an insufficient number of properties to meet the sums of money agreed, we are entitled to the cash.

As Deputy O'Sullivan said, this could continue indefinitely. Section 16 of the agreement deals with disputes arising out of this deed, save those which arise under sections nine and 13. Does this not suggest that we do not have recourse to an arbitrator under section 13?

It was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers. It was first provided in the 1995-96 academic year and has been repeated on a number of occasions since then. The most recent course commenced in February of this year.My Department is examining the teacher supply and demand needs to facilitate planning for the future. It is expected that this examination will be completed shortly. Discussions can then commence with the colleges of education on a further course.

Has the commencement of an on-line course for teacher training changed the landscape? Does the Minister believe an on-line teacher training course is a sufficient replacement for a hands-on course?We discussed on a number of previous occasions the issue of a modular graduate diploma course. I was under the impression discussions were ongoing with the colleges on that. However, if we are not even sure we are retaining the graduate diploma, have the students hoping for the modular course any hope?

We can only establish whether there is a sufficient number when we examine the teacher supply and demand figures, which are being considered by the Department. If there is a need for the course, it will proceed, but there is not a blanket commitment that we will provide the course every year.The on-line course will have an effect on teacher supply and demand because the people who undertake it will be qualified national school teachers when they complete it. We would have to take into account the numbers in that area.The modular course is being demanded by a number of people to try to facilitate students. Its format would be of benefit and the teacher unions are strongly in favour of it. Earlier this year we asked the various colleges to try to bring forward proposals in this regard. One college, the Hibernia College, has submitted a proposal in the intervening period which is being considered by HETAC. Officials in the Department have decided the modular course and any consideration of the graduate course should be deferred until these considerations had been completed. There is a commitment – certainly an interest – in ensuring some kind of modular course is  introduced as it would suit people which other types of course do not suit.

He will no doubt be aware that the estimated cost to which it refers included expenditure on items such as alcohol and cigarettes. The figure of €7,000 also includes registration, examinations and student service charges. A significant number of students have the student service charge paid on their behalf by my Department.The Government is fully aware of the cost involved in and the benefits accruing from participation in further and higher education. In this connection, on 25 May 2003 I announced a new package of student support measures costing €42 million in a full year to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third level education. This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged.The main provisions arising from the €42 million package are an increase of 15% in the maintenance grant to give a maximum grant of €2,885, benefiting, it is estimated, approximately 56,000 students; significant increases, above the normal CPI increases, in the reckonable income limits and the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education; the introduction of a revised income limit scheme, to include the following threshold levels: a new part maintenance – 75% – and full fees, an upgrading of the full fees only income limit to become a part maintenance – 25% – and full fees entitlement; an increase in the top income limit from €36,897 to €40,000, which will ensure that a significantly higher number of students  from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the student service charge; significant improvements have been effected in the special rates of maintenance grant, or top-up grants, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds; the higher, non-adjacent rate has been increased to €4,495 an amount equal to the maximum personal rate of social welfare unemployment assistance and the adjacent rate has been increased to €1,800. These increases represent top-ups on the ordinary grant of €1,610 and €645, respectively, and an increase of 10.8% to €13,760 in the annual income threshold for the special rates of grant.This substantial package of measures will provide the opportunity, in an unprecedented manner, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system.

As the first two items are being taken together, each Deputy has five minutes and the Minister has ten minutes to reply.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide classroom assistants to children with special needs in mainstream education.In the Taoiseach's address to the Special Olympics, he stated: "Watching each of these athletes compete leaves many of us feeling personally humbled by their courage, their spirit and of course their sheer enjoyment in using the skills which they have learned and developed."  This is the leader of a Government which does not want these same children and their peers to learn.Despite the euphoria surrounding the Special Olympics, the allocation of special needs assistants in schools has been cut back. While the Minister for Education and Science was announcing €42 million for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, he was instructing his Department to make cutbacks in the most vulnerable area of education by reinterpreting the criteria for the allocation of special needs assistants.Just three months after the outpouring of good will towards people with learning disabilities during the Special Olympics World Summer Games, a group of children with special needs is suffering due to cuts in the education budget. The recent junior certificate results of Patricia Carney, who has Down's syndrome, showed how well some children with special needs can do in the main stream education system. Children with Down's syndrome, given the opportunity, can reach their full potential.Up to 10,000 students at primary and second level are awaiting news of their applications for special needs resources. Some are awaiting psychological assessments, including parents of autistic children who in recent weeks were forced to obtain the assessments themselves, such is the state of the service at present. Others who have had their needs assessed are now finding that the Department is not prepared to honour its results. Only 123 psychologists of the 184 promised under the National Educational Psychological Service have been employed. The recent report of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General highlights the huge backlog of cases arising from the shortage of psychologists which has left thousands of children waiting for assessment.The Department has decided to stop basing the allocation of resources on individual needs assessments. Instead, it intends to give schools a quota of special needs assistants, teachers and resource teachers. This would involve an annual allocation being made to schools based on the predicted incidence of special educational needs within different school populations.The Minister for Education and Science's audit of special needs assistants in schools is nothing more than a whitewash for his incompetence and his Department's inability to deal with the huge volume of requests for special needs assistants. The focus needs to be on the needs of the child rather than other considerations. To apply a quota system will leave many children in the education system who require this type of special support without any service. This is evident in the speech and language therapy service and other services which are supposed to be provided. These include remedial and resource services which are being delivered on a quota basis, leaving some children high and dry with no service.As other four and five year olds settle into their second month in school, many pupils with Down's syndrome are having to cope without a special needs assistant to help them in their new environment. A typical case is Michelle Cooney from County Longford. A psychological assessment carried out by the Midlands Health Board classified her as having mild to moderate Down's syndrome and stated she required a special needs assistant for 15 hours per week, with five hours of resource teaching. Instead, Michelle was granted 3.5 hours of resource teaching and no special needs assistant. Michelle is not able to function properly without this support. She is not able to cope in the playground and she needs help with things such as using the toilet so that she does not lock herself in, dresses herself properly afterwards, washes her hands and so forth. There are 26 other pupils in her class so the teacher cannot afford to leave them unattended and go with  Michelle to the bathroom. As a result, the child is left sitting in the classroom because no support is provided.Another child who is six years of age has nowhere to go to school. On the second week in September her parents were informed that a service would be provided. However, they have not yet been told when or where that will happen. There is not even a building to provide that service.There is a crisis in this service. While the Minister has announced the provision of money for disadvantaged students in third level education, some of the most disadvantaged students in the education system are being ignored. Resources are being cut back and these children are not getting an equal opportunity to have the basic level of education to which everybody is entitled. The crazy aspect of this is that if an able bodied child were taken out of school because of a lack of resources, there would be a huge outcry from within the system and the Department would try to track down the parents concerned. However, since it is a disabled child nothing is being done. The Department is turning its back on these children.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue in more detail. There was a parliamentary question on it during Question Time. I support everything Deputy Naughten said. There are currently 5,000 primary school children awaiting assessment of their applications; a further 5,000 second level school children have not even received a response to their applications. Serious concern has been expressed by principals and parents about the crisis with regard to children who need special support.It is crucial that a child who has a special need gets support as soon as possible within the education system. It makes a huge difference in terms of their progress. I am seriously concerned about the content of the circular on this issue sent to national schools in September. It seems to indicate that the assessment of need for children with special needs will now be put back at least a year for certain categories of children. The circular is introducing what is called a staged system. In the first stage the class teacher has to assess the child over two terms. Then the learning support system within the school addresses the child's needs for another term. It is only after this that an outside psychological assessment can be sought. In effect, the child will be a full year in school before there is an independent assessment of their needs. I am seriously concerned about this. Every expert in this area stresses the importance of intervention at as early a stage as possible.I also wish to refer to the allocation of a quota to schools. The document talks about a weighted system of allocation for resource teachers and an allocation process for special needs assistants.  This would involve an annual allocation being made to schools based on predicted incidence of special education needs within different sized school populations. This rings serious alarm bells. One does not know what will be needed in a particular school. Some schools have a high incidence of children with special needs while others have a relatively low incidence. That can sometimes depend on the geographical location of the school. There will be schools in areas of disadvantage which will have a high number of children with different types of special needs.A system that makes these allocations simply on the basis of the size of the school flies in the face of the child centred approach of the education for persons with disabilities Bill which the Minister is due to introduce soon. The Minister should look again at the direction the Department is taking. It is the opposite to the approach taken in the legislation.I also wish to raise the issue of children with borderline mild general learning disability. The criteria are changing with regard to the level of educational need one must have in order to get support. One of the criteria is an IQ in the range of 70 to 79. I am not an expert on this but teachers have told me that this IQ is indicative of children with a learning disability, such as some of the Down's syndrome children mentioned by Deputy Naughten. It is expected that such pupils should, in the main, be catered for by the mainstream class teacher and the learning support teacher. The allocation of any additional resources will only be considered in exceptional circumstances following the staged approach outlined in the circular.There are many hidden cutbacks in the document on children with special needs. It is a difficult document to read but teachers, parents and a number of Deputies are beginning to realise that these are cutbacks for children with special needs, hidden in fancy language. I hope the Minister will take a personal interest in this and try to ensure that what is happening in the Department does not fly in the face of what he is doing in the legislation.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter because it gives me another opportunity to inform the House of the range of assistance being provided by the Department. I assure Deputy O'Sullivan that I take a personal interest in what is happening in the special needs section of the Department. I have visited it on a number of occasions, met the staff involved and listened carefully to what they said. I have met with a number of groups representing children with disabilities and I am conscious of the concerns they expressed.I am more than willing to brief the Deputies on what is happening and what we are trying to  achieve with regard to special needs. There is no doubt from the assessments we have carried out that the system is being clogged by applications that are not as meritorious as they should be. As a result, pupils who have severe needs and who should be looked after immediately must wait until the applications are fully processed. I am anxious to streamline that system. There is no desire on my part to cut back on anything to do with special needs. It is important that we provide the same level of service but we must also ensure that young people who have special needs are treated properly and that people are not just labelled for convenience within the school system and perhaps labelled for life. That is another aspect of this matter about which we must be extremely careful.Up to October 1998, my Department's capacity to respond to individual children with special needs was limited. This changed with a Government decision in that year whereby children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. Since this automatic entitlement to support was introduced, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from approximately 100 to in excess of 2,300 and the number of special needs assistants has grown from approximately 300 to almost 5,500 full and part-time posts.The nature and level of the educational response is based on the professionally assessed needs of each child. While my Department's policy is to promote the maximum possible integration of pupils with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools, those who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes and units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools with special back-up supports. The response will normally take the form of a resource teacher or special needs assistant support or both, depending on the level of need involved.In some cases, the level of special need involved may be such as to require placement in a special class attached to a mainstream school. The number of special classes has grown from 350 to more than 500 since 1998. Each such class is dedicated to a particular disability category and operates at a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio. Pupils attending such special classes also attract special increased rates of capitation funding.Children with special needs attending mainstream schools may also require access to special equipment to assist them in their education. The funding allocation in this area has grown from €671,000 in 1998 to a current figure of €3.2 million. It is only in exceptional cases that my Department considers an educational placement outside the country as being necessary. In general, where children have significant care needs, those are met in an educational context through the special needs assistant service.I am determined to ensure that this considerable investment is deployed as effectively and flexibly as possible. With that aim in mind, a detailed circular, 24/03, was recently issued to all schools dealing with the allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs in national schools. The basic purpose of that circular is twofold, to ensure that applications for resource teacher and special needs assistant support are processed as efficiently as possible and that such resources are targeted to best effect on an ongoing basis.With regard to the processing of applications, priority has been given to the 780 applications in respect of new entrant children. Following a review of the supporting documentation submitted, the applicant schools have, where appropriate, been given allocations. Those allocations have initially been given on a temporary basis, pending an examination in due course of the level of resources already made available to the schools.The remaining 4,700 applications will be processed by a dedicated team of inspectors and psychologists, and every effort will be made to issue a response as early as possible during the current school year. A census of pupils with special educational needs and associated resources in primary schools is being conducted at present and the data will enable the team to consider the applications in the context of the existing level of resources available to each school.The circular highlights a number of practical strategies to assist schools with existing resource allocations. For example, wherever possible, schools should provide additional help for pupils with special educational needs in the mainstream classroom or, if necessary, in small groups; bearing in mind the various categories of special education teachers, including resource, learning support and visiting teachers deployed in the education system, schools are encouraged to develop strategies that draw on the skills of all such teachers without making artificial distinctions between them; and while resource teaching allocations have been approved on the basis of individual applications, the overriding principle is that those resources be deployed in the manner that best meets the needs of pupils with special educational needs in the school.For example, if there are three pupils who have been allocated two and a half resource teacher hours each, the school should consider, depending on the children, whether it might be better to have two or three children together in a  small group with the teacher for seven and a half hours rather than simply giving them the two and a half hours individually. That is the type of approach involved. As Deputy O'Sullivan has said, and I agree, it must be as child-centred as possible to meet the needs of the child. Before applying for additional special needs assistants, schools should review their existing allocations to see whether an identified need can be met by redeploying available resources. Where appropriate, principals may deploy individual special needs assistants to support several pupils, perhaps in more than one classroom.At this point I emphasise that circular 24/03 is not proposing a cut in resources for pupils with special educational needs. Schools will appreciate, however, that the level of approved resources is not immutable. Account must be taken of the progress being made by individual pupils with special educational needs. One hopes that the extra attention they get will mean that pupils can progress. If that is so, there is no longer the same need for extra resources. However, that must be measured. It would be expected that schools would notify the Department of instances where resources had become surplus to requirements so that these could be redeployed as necessary. Put simply, the circular requires schools to take full account of what they already have before applying for more. Any other approach would be neither appropriate nor sustainable.The Deputies have made several points, particularly regarding the weighted system. The idea is that instead of this year's situation where there have been so many applications, based on experience such as the size of the school, of which we currently have a great deal, there would be an automatic allocation of special needs assistants to it, meaning that it would not have to apply. Then, when we have a really bad case of a child who is profoundly handicapped, physically or otherwise, the school can make an application for him or her. Fewer applications would come in and they could be processed much more quickly. That is the idea behind it. We are having discussions with the teacher unions about that, as well as with management. Over the next few weeks, if the Deputies wish a briefing on what exactly is behind the changes, I will have no difficulty in arranging one for them.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I thank the Minister for coming in to take this debate this evening. I hope that together we will resolve this problem. The education system has been in crisis in Donabate in recent years, and that is true for both first and second level. The Donabate boys' and girls' schools are filled to capacity. The media reported on two incidents some weeks ago where families who had taken up residence in Donabate were  unable to get their children into school. There are huge waiting lists for those schools for next year. At the same time, Donabate Portrane Educate Together is unable to get the necessary support from the Department of Education and Science – while acknowledging some support that it received – to locate a temporary building on a site identified and owned by Fingal County Council. The children are being taught at Turvey Golf Club. The school furniture must be removed each day to facilitate the social dimension of the club in the evening. That is totally unacceptable and I hope that the problem can be resolved.Donabate is a developing area with no second level school. According to the Department of Education and Science, pupils from Portrane and Donabate reside in the Swords catchment area for post-primary school purposes. Already significant numbers of students attend the second level schools in Swords. However, those schools, which already cater for a population of more than 30,000, are filled to capacity. That is the reality and parents have to find alternative second level schools. There are currently more than 160 second level students living in Donabate and Portrane who attend schools in Malahide, Portmarnock and Baldoyle. Those are second level schools. Malahide Community School will not be able to accept new students in September 2004 from Donabate, and that will make things worse.The vast majority of those students rely solely on the existing inadequate rail service to get to and from school. The train service does not have the capacity to cope with 150 second level students at Donabate railway station. The Minister should try to imagine the situation when the children attempt to board a train already filled to capacity with commuters along the line from Drogheda. On numerous occasions I have witnessed the jostling before the train arrives, not only with the students but with hundreds of commuters trying to get on to an already overcrowded train. I have seen incidents where children have been cast aside on the platform and thrown off the train by frustrated adults trying to get to work. The position will get infinitely worse as the population grows in north County Dublin, including Donabate. A solution is required before a serious accident or death occurs.On numerous occasions, children have been left behind, which results in their being late for school, which affects their education and disturbs the classes when they arrive. The principals of Malahide Community College, Portmarnock Community College and St. Mary's secondary school in Baldoyle have outlined to the parents, the Department and myself the implications for the students in question and the management of the schools. Irish Rail in a written document has also made submissions to the Department outlining the difficulties being experienced by commuters, including students, and supporting the  provision of alternative transport – in this case a direct bus service.The Minister has the responsibility to provide education for the children of the Donabate-Portrane area and to provide reliable and safe transport. This is being denied to the students. I am not prepared to accept a statement from the Department that it has no plans to depart from the terms of the school transport scheme in this case. The current situation is untenable and will get worse and should be accepted as a special case. I have discussed this matter with the Minister off the record as has my colleague, Deputy Glennon, which is in the interests of the education and safety of our children. It is not as if this case is being manipulated. A major problem exists. One has only to go down to the platform in the morning to find 150 or 160 students with school bags on their backs trying to board. I ask for the Minister's support in finding a resolution to this matter.

I give him great credit for his persistence and his continual raising of this matter with me. If I turn a corner of Leinster House any evening, either he or Deputy Glennon raises the matter. However. I am afraid I cannot give him much comfort in regard to this matter.One of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly. In urban areas, schools are generally closer to the pupils' homes and public scheduled transport is normally available.Where children in urban areas qualify for school transport under the terms of the scheme, they are issued with term tickets subject to payment of the appropriate term contribution. For the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they live, are eligible for transport under the school transport scheme to that centre.While it is the parents' prerogative to send their children to the school of choice, that does not mean the State is in a position to incur the additional expense entailed in facilitating that choice. To provide for choice of school would add enormously to the cost of the scheme by duplicating transport services all over the place.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	310	In such instances, eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one, may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of  the centre being attended. This is subject to spare accommodation being available on an existing service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred. Pupils availing of this concession are known as catchment boundary pupils.My Department may not sanction transport into any adjoining catchment area as an encroachment would constitute an infringement of the terms of the post-primary transport scheme. My Department has to consider the operation of the school transport scheme as a whole and the requirement not to breach guidelines, which would have financial and policy implications for the transport service overall. As the Deputy has pointed out, the pupils from this area reside in the Swords catchment area and are eligible for transport to the schools in Swords.Eligible pupils from the Portrane-Donabate areas offering for transport to post-primary schools outside the Swords area are being facilitated with term tickets for transport on the public scheduled service from the nearest point inside the catchment area. The availability of such transport is subject to the normal conditions of the transport scheme.The Deputy gave the answer to the question and asked me not to repeat it. However, I had better do so for the record. My Department has no plans to depart from the normal terms of the scheme in this case.By way of being helpful to the Deputy, there is now a school transport appeal body in place. It may be worth his while to put in an appeal to that body and ask it to consider the special circumstances outlined to me. I appreciate they are special circumstances.When a scheme is in operation, civil servants do not like making special exemptions. In relation to the school in that area which the Deputy mentioned, we have good news. Fingal County Council is providing the site.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to again raise this important matter on the Adjournment. I assume the Minister for Education and Science is responding. I am disappointed that none of the Ministers with responsibility for health can be here to respond. However, the Minister for Education and Science is in the North-Eastern Health Board area and our nearest county and, perhaps, he will convey the message to the Minister.As one of those who had asked for an independent person outside the health board structure to look at the situation in Monaghan General Hospital I had looked forward to the Bonner report. Where stands the Bonner report? Has any of it been implemented? Is there a process in place to ensure it is implemented in full? I saw this exercise as a start to stabilise Monaghan Gen eral Hospital. It is now 15 months since Monaghan General Hospital was taken off call. Is Mr. Kevin Bonner still involved? Mr. Bonner assured the North Eastern Health Board and the general public, through the media, attending that meeting that he was confident funding would be made available to honour his report. He was appointed by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and had discussions with the Department of Health and Children and other personnel as well as the chief executive and members of the North Eastern Health Board.Monaghan General Hospital is providing a good service to those who know the way in. Patients can go in by car, on foot or on a bicycle but not by ambulance. The father of Denis Taylor, the famous snooker player, was operated on in Monaghan General Hospital as part of a cross-Border co-operation project. Yet patients from this island have been sent to Manchester at enormous cost to the nation for similar surgery which could have been carried out by eminent surgeons in Monaghan General Hospital. Two of these surgeons were appointed when my colleague, Deputy Noonan, was Minister for Health and Children. The surgeon, Mr. Moloney, retired and was replaced by two surgeons, Mr. McAleese and Mr. McMullan.The Bonner report does not go anywhere near delivering what I or others would desire for Monaghan General Hospital, its excellent staff and its patients. The restructuring suggested would be a major start. Some €3.8 million to be spent on a treatment room and a further €10 million, as proposed in the report, for 2004 would be a first real step of commitment to Monaghan General Hospital. The Minister has a budget of €9.2 million to deal with the problems including Monaghan General Hospital and Cavan General Hospital or have them treated as equal partners under the Cavan-Monaghan hospital arrangement.I believe the overall budget is not the problem, and this belief is supported by none other than Professor Niamh Brennan. A recent newspaper report stated:In the past, commentators have referred to a black hole in the health service. The problems found through her report were not so much a black hole, rather there are so many holes in our health services that it is more akin to a colander or a sieve.Professor Brennan was appointed by the Minister to produce a report and she has made it clear that she believes her report's recommendations will only be implemented by an independent person who is outside the health board.We have had an independent person in Monaghan who is outside the health board, but nine months after his appointment we have seen no improvements. In his final summary he said that  the proposals provide a sound basis for Monaghan to continue providing excellent patient care, which complements services being provided elsewhere. It is vital that all the consultants in Cavan-Monaghan agree and actively support these proposals and participate in the preparation and implementation of the necessary protocols. I would like to see that happening.There has been cross-party support for Monaghan General Hospital within our council chamber and I was part of that. It has not worked and I am pleading with the Minister. The Hanly report will come out in the next 24 hours or so but we always seem to be one report away from a decision. The Minister appointed Mr. Kevin Bonner and it is on his report that the Minister and the health board must deliver.

I point out to Deputy Crawford that responsibility for services in Monaghan General Hospital rests with the North-Eastern Health Board, not the Minister. It is a matter for the board to determine—
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Is the Minister in charge at all?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	314	—the nature and level of service provision at the hospital consistent with the board's commitment to the provision of a highly qualified, efficient and cost-effective service across the north eastern region.As the Deputy outlined, Kevin Bonner, management consultant and former Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, was commissioned to advise, inter alia, on an appropriate management structure for Monaghan General Hospital and to assist the board in implementing this structure. He also worked with the board to facilitate the resolution of any outstanding issues pertaining to the provision of services at the hospital, including emergency services. On 25 July 2003 the Minister for Health and Children published the report from Mr. Bonner on the hospital. The Minister indicated at that time his acceptance of the main recommendation of the report that Monaghan General Hospital should continue to play a vital role in the delivery of acute hospital services to the local community within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. The Minister also accepted that additional services be developed at the hospital to the benefit of the local community. In particular the Minister welcomed the proposals in the report aimed at strengthening the management capacity of the hospital within the Cavan-Monaghan group. The central involvement of consultant staff with this new structure is a very significant development which should enhance the ability of the group to deliver high quality services.Mr. Bonner recognised in his report that the pattern of acute hospital service is changing world-wide and that Monaghan hospital's best guarantee for the future is to participate in and accept those changes which will ensure its future viability. In this context the report's recommendations in relation to the range and configuration of acute services to be delivered within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group are being considered by the North Eastern Health Board. The forthcoming national task force on medical staffing – the Hanly report referred to by the Deputy – will further inform decisions in this regard. The task force was asked to make recommendations on how best to organise hospital medical staffing within the hospital system, having regard to the requirements of the European working time directive to reduce the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the recommendations of the forum on medical manpower. The report of the task force on medical staffing is due to be published shortly.In accordance with the recommendations in the Bonner report, the Minister made additional capital funding available to the North Eastern  Health Board under the national development plan. This will allow the board to address urgent capital needs at Monaghan General Hospital in such areas as equipment replacement, refurbishment, fire precaution and other health and safety measures.A project team under the national development plan has also been established at each hospital in the region, including Monaghan General Hospital. The initial responsibility of the project team is to identify service requirements and to prepare a planning brief for the preparation of an outlying development control plan in respect of the hospital site. The preparation of these briefs is now at an advanced stage.The Minister is assured by the North Eastern Health Board of its continuing commitment to the future provision and development of services at Monaghan General Hospital. The Minister considers it essential that all parties involved play their part to resolve the present difficulties and to ensure the future delivery of services at the hospital as an integral part of the existing Cavan-Monaghan hospital group.The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 October 2003.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I recognise the importance of early intervention as a means of preventing future educational disadvantage. As well as supporting a number of early intervention programmes at pre-school level, I have provided more than €70 million in 2003 for disadvantaged programmes at primary level, aimed at ensuring that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are given the opportunity to maximise their potential within the education system.Key programmes include the Giving Children an Even Break programme and the home school community liaison scheme. Other measures directed towards the support of primary school pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds include the book grant scheme and the school meals programme. The school completion programme and the National Educational Welfare Board, both of which operate at primary and post primary levels, also play a crucial role in this regard. In all this work I am advised by the statutory Educational Disadvantage Committee set up under the Education Act 1998 to advise on the policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and address educational disadvantage.The provision of up to date curricula that are relevant to the learning needs of students makes an important contribution to the quality of the educational experience. A revised primary school curriculum and accompanying teacher guidelines were published by my Department in September 1999. The implementation of this curriculum is being supported by a comprehensive programme of in-career development for teachers, delivered by the primary curriculum support programme. This curriculum is designed in order that teachers can provide an educational programme tailored to the needs of all pupils.My Department conducts regular national surveys of literacy and numeracy standards in primary schools. A national literacy survey of pupils in first and fifth classes in primary schools will be held in May 2004.

When recognition was granted, the patron body of the school – Educate Together – was made aware that it was likely that a period of seven to ten years could elapse before permanent accommodation would be provided. This is due to the enormity of demand, including demands for permanent accommodation, within the system. It was further pointed out that it would remain the patron's responsibility to provide interim accommodation until my Department would be in a position to provide permanent accommodation. In this regard, my Department assists in defraying the cost of rent incurred.As part of the recognition process, the patron's proposals for accommodating the school were examined. These proposals involved locating the school in a local scouts den pending the outcome of negotiations to lease a suitable site on which portacabins could be erected. It was stated that these negotiations were at an advanced stage. The planning section of my Department expressed reservations at these proposals given that the scouts den could provide only a short-term solution and given my Department's concern that negotiations to secure accommodation that would provide a more medium-term solution were incomplete.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The first published analysis by my Department of school retention in Ireland was released in August this year. The report indicates that: of those who commenced the junior cycle programme in September 1994, approximately 3,600 – 5.7% – left school before completing the junior certificate three years later; that approximately 8,900 of those who sat the junior certificate did not sit the leaving certificate; and that approximately 12,500 – 18.2% – young people leave school annually without the leaving certificate.My Department's policy in relation to the retention of young people who are at risk of early school leaving is to support young people in school and to support schools to adapt to the needs of the young people experiencing difficulties. The problem of early school leaving is a complex issue to resolve and requires movement on a number of fronts, including legislative and curricular reforms and preventative interventions and this is the approach that my Department is taking.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 was signed into law by the President on 10 April 2002. The Act provided for the establishment of both the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee. I can confirm that both the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee have been put in place and are fully operational.The Residential Institutions Redress Board is located at Block 5, Belfield Office Park, Beech Hill Road, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4. The Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee is located at Floor 1, Frederick House, 19 South Frederick Street, Dublin 2.Judge Seán O'Leary, a serving Circuit Court judge, has been appointed chairperson of the redress board and five ordinary members have also been appointed. The review committee is chaired by Judge Frank Murphy, a former Supreme Court judge and two other members have also been appointed. A total of 27 administration staff have been appointed to the redress board and the review committee.The purpose of the Act is to set up a framework to enable victims of institutional abuse to apply for redress. The provisions of the Act allows the board to make awards on a lower threshold of proof than is required in taking a case through the courts. An applicant is expected to provide proof of his or her identity, that he or she was resident in an institution, that he or she was injured while so resident and that the injury is consistent with any allegation of abuse that is alleged to have occurred while so resident. An applicant may accept or reject an award made to him or her or may submit the award for a review to the review committee.Application forms and a guide to the application process have been available from the board's office since 2 December 2002 and are also available from the board's website at www.rirb.ie. Applications will be accepted for a period of three years from the formal establishment date of the board, that is, 16 December 2002.The Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee are independent of my Department. However, I understand that the board has received in access of 2,000 applications to date and that the applications are being received at a rate of 50 per week. The number of awards or settlement offers made by the board is 200 and the average award paid to date is €80,745.

This level of support was approved on the basis of the professional documentation submitted by the relevant school and is consistent in nature and extent with the general response in similar circumstances. I further understand that the application indicated that the child has a specific speech and language disorder as well as a mild general learning disability. However, no speech therapy report was forwarded with the application. In order for my Department to review the case, such a report should now be submitted.

It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels. My objective is to ensure that all young people leave the education system with a high quality education and related qualifications to support their full participation in society and in the economy.My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, 2003-05 – NAPSincl. – and the latest partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on literacy, numeracy and early school leavers. Some €460 million is being provided by my Department in 2003 for programmes specifically designed to tackle educational disadvantage in accordance with the strategies outlined in the NAPSincl. and Sustaining Progress. This includes provision for programmes at pre-school, primary and post primary levels, as well as provision for the youth sector, further education measures and programmes designed to broaden access to third level for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

I want to confirm again my absolute commitment to ensuring that funding is targeted at those schools which are most in need of investment. The reality is that projects which are the subject of media campaigns are not necessarily those in most need. The prioritisation system used by my Department aims to allocate funding to projects based on an assessment of any project's validity against publicised criteria rather than as a reaction to lobbying or publicity.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	322	The 2003 schools building programme was published on 22 January 2003 and amounted to €342.9 million – four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, several hundred schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme. All primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.An innovative feature of this year's programme is the introduction of a devolved building initiative for small rural primary schools. Twenty school communities will benefit from this pilot initiative. The feedback from schools on this initiative is very positive and most of the 20 schools will have commenced construction works before the end of this year. I hope to build on this initiative in future years.

The role of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council is to establish policies and criteria for the making of higher education and training awards and the validation of programmes, to determine the standards of knowledge skills and competences to be acquired by learners for an award, to make or recognise awards, and to monitor the quality of programmes, ensuring that providers have procedures for assessment of learners which are fair and consistent. The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland is responsible for establishing the overall policies and criteria for the framework of qualifications, and the procedures for the performance of the functions of the awards councils.

It has been the experience of the Department that the Freedom of Information Act is sometimes not the most appropriate means of dealing with such requests as the records can, in some cases, contain sensitive information. In other cases, there may be no information. Furthermore, in many cases, the release of documents results in the need for individuals to be able to access services such as counselling, tracing and mediation. The Department, while recognising the need, is not best placed to offer such services to former residents.Barnardos had already been involved in the process of record release in a limited number of situations where the nature of the record required a particularly sensitive and supportive manner of release. In order to provide a comprehensive and compassionate service and following a request from Barnardos, my Department agreed to support the provision of an information mediation service, Origins, for former residents of industrial or reformatory schools. My Department took account of the established competence and experience of Barnardos in the release of similar forms of information to persons in similar circumstances. The operation of Origins is governed by the terms of a service agreement which has been signed by both parties.

A brief for the project has been agreed with the school authorities. However, due to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction my Department is not in a position to initiate the architectural planning of any further large scale projects during 2003. The question of advancing the project to architectural planning will be considered in the context of the 2004 capital programme.

As the organisation of classes is a matter for individual school principals, my Department does not have information on the number of pupils being taught by these teachers. There were 152,053 teaching days undertaken by unqualified teachers in the primary system in the 2002-03 school year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Pupils and parents enjoy a number of legal rights regarding their choice of school for primary education. These derive from the Constitution, legislation and my Department's rules.Statutory rights to choice of school derive from the Education Act 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard, including promoting "the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources".In addition, section 15 (2)(d) of the 1998 Act provides that a board of management of a primary school shall “publish, in such manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school . . . . and ensure that as regards that policy principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected and such directions as may be made from time to time by the Minister, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the constitutional rights of all persons concerned, are complied with”.At present, officials in my Department are in consultation with officials in the office of the parliamentary counsel to the Government with a view to drawing up regulations under the Act governing the preparation of admissions policies. This work is ongoing and will be concluded as speedily as possible. The purpose of these proposed regulations is to promote greater consistency, transparency and accountability in decision-making at school level and to further the objective, under the Education Act, of equality and participation in education.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters, including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Prior to and during the drafting of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, there have been ongoing consultations with the Department of Health and Children regarding the proposed legislative provisions. These consultations will continue during the Bill's passage through the Houses.The Supreme Court has ruled that the State's constitutional obligation to provide for free primary education applies to children and ceases at the age of 18. The Bill's aim is to implement this constitutional obligation by guaranteeing the rights of children with disabilities to education, enforceable through a statutory framework. This framework will provide for a range of services which must be provided, including assessments, individual education plans and support services and provides for a process of mediation and appeals where needs are not met. It is for this reason that the Bill focuses primarily on children with special educational needs.The Bill recognises the fact that there are issues relevant to the education of a person as an adult which must be addressed when the person is still a child and places obligations on the new National Council for Special Education in respect of this. In addition, the Disabilities Bill which is to be published by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will provided for a wide range of services for people with disabilities, including education services.

The context for the review is provided by Ireland's strategic objective of placing its higher education system in the top rank of the OECD in terms of both quality and levels of participation and by the priority to create a world class research, development and innovation capacity and infrastructure in Ireland as part of the wider EU objective for becoming the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy and society, as agreed in Lisbon in 2000. The challenges of maintaining quality, responsiveness and competitiveness in higher education are a major priority against the background of unprecedented levels of expansion, change and diversification in the sector in Ireland.The OECD review will evaluate how well the Irish higher education sector is meeting these strategic objectives and will offer recommendations for making further progress. The review will examine the role of higher education institutions as centres of education, knowledge and research in respect of their public, social and economic responsibilities and will consider the interface between the higher and further education sectors in meeting these overall needs. The capacity of the higher education sector for promoting lifelong learning, the transition to the knowledge society, knowledge and technology transfer to the economy and society, supporting spatial strategy, and in meeting the international challenges to learning and research institutions will be key aspects of the review. The comparative Irish performance will be examined by reference to other OECD countries.

This programme was instigated in May 1999 with the Taoiseach's apology to all victims of abuse on behalf of Irish society.The provision of funding for the survivor support groups and the outreach support services is to meet the costs of providing a comprehensive information and referral service for victims of abuse, both in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The services provided include information services for survivors on the Government strategy for addressing historic abuse and referral services to counselling, education and other health services.Funding is currently provided for a number of support groups, namely, Right of Place, SOCA UK, Alliance and Right to Peace. My Department also provides funding for five outreach centres in the United Kingdom, two in London one each in Sheffield, Manchester and Coventry.The following is a breakdown of the funding provided for the survivor groups in 2002 and 2003 to date:

The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools was substantially increased from €57.14 per pupil in 1997 to €111.58 per pupil in 2003. This represented an increase of 95% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level over the period. In addition, the ancillary services grant has been increased from €38.09, £30, per pupil in 1999 to €127 per pupil in 2003.Since 1997 significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to voluntary secondary schools. For example, the standard per capita grant in 1997 was €224.74. This has been increased to €266.49 in the current school year. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total per capita grant in the case of these schools to over €300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support services grant from €25.40 per pupil in the year 2000 to €99 per pupil this school year. The level of capitation grants for 2004 will be reviewed as part of the normal Estimates process.

The cost of providing these supports has been rising steadily since 1998 and in the current year, the sum of the estimate by vocational education committees of their needs exceeds the amount of money available.I appreciate that the shortage of funds for child care supports has given rise to difficulties for a number of vocational education committees and may impact on the options available to adult learners in relation to participation in second chance education programmes. At present, I am examining the possibility of providing some special assistance to vocational education committees that are particularly badly affected.

Under existing regulations seat belts are not compulsory on school buses. In operating the school transport scheme,  Bus Éireann is fully compliant with all relevant regulations as laid down by that Department. Contractors' large vehicles, when tested by the Garda authorities to obtain the licence to operate school bus and other public services, are not required to have seat belts installed to get the PSV licence.I understand that agreement has been reached on a proposal to amend the directive on the provision of seat belts on motor vehicles. This will include a regulation to have seat belts fitted to certain school buses from a future date.This decision will be considered in consultation with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and having regard to the commitment in "the Road to Safety – The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002. A consultation paper that set out a wide range of options for enhancing school bus safety was published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government last year. Following an extended consultation period a large number of responses were received. These are being reviewed with a view to identifying a range of specific proposals for implementation.

The therapies include art therapy, Stretch & Grow – a specific exercise and health programme – and music therapy. General responsibility for the provision of therapy services is a matter for the health authorities and my officials have contacted the Department of Health and Children to acquaint them with the proposal. I should point out that therapists were recruited and the therapies put into practice in the school before any application was made to my Department for funding.

Grant aid at postgraduate level is only available to students pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland.In general, the approved undergraduate courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are no plans at present to expand the schemes to include courses in private colleges in other EU member states.Tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, is available on third level tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU member states and in non-EU countries. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.

To date funding in excess of €120 million has been provided by the Government for the programme and the survey indicates that average pupil to computer ratios have reduced in the period from 35:1 to just over 11:1 in primary schools, from 16:1 to 9:1 in secondary schools and from 9:1 to less than 4:1 in special schools. These ratios compare well with many other European countries, although they are slightly below the EU average.The Government remains fully committed to promoting ICT as a teaching and learning tool across the curriculum and to providing schools with the necessary support for achieving this. My Department and the NCTE are currently examining the findings of the NCTE survey with a view to determining future policy and funding priorities within available resources. A detailed report of the survey is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.

The working group will examine and make recommendations on a range of aspects of medical education and training in Ireland. This will include the areas of course curriculum, teaching methods, interdisciplinary working and other issues relating to the organisation and delivery of undergraduate medical education and training.

I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Irish National Alliance for Action on Alcohol regarding the booklet. My Department has not approved the contents of the booklet. However, organisations and private individuals are entitled to write to schools without the approval of my Department.Education concerning alcohol is addressed in both-primary and post primary schools in the context of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum. Every primary school is implementing the primary social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum which includes substance misuse education and prevention, from the start of this school year. Detailed educational resource material – Walk Tall programme – is provided for schools to support teachers in addressing substance misuse education and prevention.In post primary schools, the implementation of SPHE, which incorporates alcohol misuse education and prevention, at junior cycle has been supported by the post-primary SPHE support service since September 2000. This service works in partnership with health promotion personnel in regional health boards.All post-primary schools will have implemented SPHE as part of their junior cycle programmes with effect from September 2003. On My Own Two Feet is the specific educational resource material which supports teachers in addressing substance misuse education and prevention in the context of SPHE.

This changed with a Government decision in October 1998, whereby children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. Since this automatic entitlement to support was introduced, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from approximately 100 to in excess of 2,300 and the number of special needs assistants has grown from approximately 300 to almost 5,500 full-time and part-time posts.

It contains approximately 180 individual recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates and early intervention, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services and the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues.The scope of these recommendations is such as to require a multifaceted response. My Department's key focus to date has been on progressing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with autism in line with the task force's recommendations. These measures will be fundamental to the implementation of many of the task force's recommendations.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I am satisfied that current arrangements for the redeployment of over-quota teachers in the second level system are unsatisfactory and in need of fundamental review. I have asked my Department to develop proposals for a more effective system which will ensure that all available teaching resources within the second level system are deployed to best effect.A scheme for the redeployment of over-quota teachers in Catholic secondary schools has been in place since 1988-89. This scheme was agreed between the religious authorities of the schools and the ASTI. The object of the scheme was to secure the redeployment of over-quota teachers within the Catholic secondary school sector by matching identified surplus teachers to needs elsewhere in the sector for teachers in the same subject areas.The reality is that very few of the over-quota posts emerging in this sector have proved amenable to redeployment. A significant impediment under the current scheme has been the requirement that the most junior teacher in the school be redeployed. In many instances the subject area of the most junior teacher does not match the subject area of potential recipient schools.Currently, there is no scheme in place for redeployment of over-quota teachers in the community and comprehensive school sector. In the case of the VEC sector, teacher allocations are made to the individual VEC schemes rather than individual schools within the schemes, and each scheme can deploy its teachers in line with its evolving needs.

Each class caters for a maximum of seven children and each class requires the services of a speech therapist. The speech therapy service is provided by the relevant health authority. At present, a total of 56 such classes are in place in the primary system. Children who meet the criteria for admission to specific speech and language disorder classes generally spend two years in such classes.Children with specific speech and language disorder not attending a special class may also be entitled to support from the resource teacher and special needs assistant services. The nature and level of support provided is based on the professionally-assessed needs of the individual child. All schools have been advised of the procedures to be followed where resource teacher or special needs assistant support is being sought in respect of a child with special needs.It is the policy of my Department that teachers working with children with specific speech and language disorders have appropriate training. As such, this area is covered in the postgraduate training programme in special educational needs for teachers working in special classes, special schools or as resource teachers in mainstream primary and post primary schools. In addition, my Department supports initiatives, at local level, provided in collaboration with speech and language therapists and the teacher training colleges.

My Department has issued a circular letter to all second level schools inviting them to opt in to implementing the revised syllabus from September 2003 and to apply for the accompanying once-off equipment-resource grant by completing the application form enclosed. Schools will only receive the additional resource grant on adopting the revised syllabus. Schools in the free education scheme which opt to provide the revised syllabus from September 2003 will be given a grant of €3,500 per laboratory if they have had a major capital upgrade or new facility since 1995, or if their existing facilities are adequate to deliver the present curriculum, or a higher rate of grant per laboratory, based on needs identified on foot of an itemised list set out in a spreadsheet which accompanied the circular letter to schools, where their existing resources are not adequate to deliver the current syllabus. The amount of this grant will vary, depending on the needs identified.

The exceptional arrangement had regard to the fact that agreement was reached at the end of the school year and was designed to effect early payment. The arrangements which applied for that year only provided for payment to permanent, temporary wholetime or eligible part-time teachers who were certified as having engaged in voluntary substitution-supervision over and above timetabled hours on the basis that they demonstrated a willingness to co-operate with and assisted in the provision of supervision and substitution during the school year 2001-02.

This changed with a Government decision in October 1998, whereby children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to an appropriate response to their needs. Since this automatic entitlement to support was introduced, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from approximately 100 to in excess of 2,300 and the number of special needs assistants has grown from approximately 300 to almost 5,500 full – and part-time posts.The nature and level of the educational response is based on the professionally-assessed needs of each individual child. While my Department's policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of pupils with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools, those who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes and units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special backup supports. The response will normally take the form of resource teacher or special needs assistant support, or both, depending on the level of need involved.In some cases, the level of special need involved may be such as to require placement in a special class attached to a mainstream school. The number of special classes has grown from 350 to more than 500 since 1998. Each such class is dedicated to a particular disability category and operates at a significantly reduced pupil teacher ratio. Pupils attending these special classes also attract special increased rates of capitation funding. It is only in exceptional cases that my Department considers an educational placement outside the country as being necessary. In general, where children have significant care needs, these are met in an education context through the special needs assistant service.

The recognition of the qualification will apply so long as all the conditions set by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, are met, including those relating to quality assurance. The council was set up under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999 to establish policies and criteria for the making of higher education and training awards and the validation of programmes outside the university sector, to determine the standards of knowledge skills and competences to be acquired by learners for an award, to make or recognise awards, and to monitor the quality of programmes, ensuring that providers have procedures for assessment of learners which are fair and consistent.

I have made the point in talks with a wide range of education interest groups that, all too often, the debate on education matters can be somewhat insular and that the overwhelming focus upon immediate issues leaves little scope for long-term planing. It is my intention to put a process in place to address this deficit. My officials are finalising proposals to me and I expect to be in a position to give full details in the near future.

Pupils who live remote from the main body of pupils may not always be facilitated with suitable transport as the cost involved may be prohibitive. Transport grants are payable by my Department to eligible pupils, including special needs pupils who cannot be facilitated with school transport. The grants scheme was introduced by my Department to assist parents with costs associated with getting their children to school. The exact level of grant aid payable is based on strict criteria such as distance, special needs, hardship etc. The existing rates of grant aid are the most that can be offered by my Department at present. However, the matter will be kept under review.

I am on record as acknowledging that the significant levels of investment made in school buildings in recent years need to be maintained going forward if the goal of eliminating substandard accommodation is to be achieved. To that end in the context of the Estimates process I am seeking to put in place a multi-annual capital funding envelope for the next four to five years. I consider that the provision of such an envelope for the schools building programme will enable my Department to provide greater clarity for all education partners concerning the progress of projects within the programme.The major investment of recent years in upgrading school accommodation has resulted in new and enhanced school accommodation throughout the country. In the five years up to and including 2002, a total of €1,248 million has been spent by my Department on primary and post-primary school buildings. This is a very significant amount of investment.The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government.

The group consists of representatives of the Department of Education of Northern Ireland and of representatives of my Department and the Department of Finance. It also includes actuaries on both sides. In November 2001 the group reported to the North-South Ministerial Council that progress was being made and pointed out the potential for agreement on the establishment of a feasible transfer system. The group has identified a wide range of complex financial and technical issues which it proposes to investigate in more detail. In this connection a paper on the financial implications is currently under preparation by the actuaries, which when completed will form the basis of further discussions by the group.

When recognition was granted, the patron body of the school, Educate Together, was made aware that it was likely that a period of seven to ten years could elapse before permanent accommodation would be provided. This is due to the enormity of demand, including demands for permanent accommodation, within the system. It was further pointed out that it would remain the patron's responsibility to provide interim accommodation until my Department would be in a position to provide permanent accommodation. In this regard, my Department assists in defraying the cost of rent incurred.As part of the recognition process, the patron's proposals for accommodating the school were examined. These proposals involved locating the school in a local scouts' den pending the outcome of negotiations to lease a suitable site on which portacabins could be erected. It was stated that these negotiations were at an advanced stage. The planning section of my Department expressed reservations at these proposals given that the scouts' den could provide only a short-term solution and given the Department's concern that negotiations to secure accommodation that would provide a more medium term solution were incomplete. However, my Department decided, on balance, to grant provisional recognition, accepting in good faith, that the patron body had arrangements in hand to accommodate the expected expansion of the school. As is the case of all schools granted provisional recognition the patron and board of management were instructed to implement an enrolment policy that would permit growth commensurate with the available accommodation. Regrettably, the patron body was unable to secure the accommodation solution originally proposed. An alternative site, in the ownership of Fingal County Council was, however, sourced. This arrangement was deemed satisfactory and my Department approved the rental of portacabins and associated site costs.

Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of €5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme for schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for the current year.In 2002, primary schools designated as disadvantaged schools received a grant of €1,270 while other recognised primary schools received a grant of €635. Approximately €2.4 million was allocated to schools in 2002 under this scheme. In the light of the current budgetary constraints, I decided to withdraw payment of the grant for 2003. The position will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process in the coming years. I would point out that, in addition to the specific grant referred to, both primary and post-primary schools can use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula, including PE.

Such allocations are made under the heading of "Co-operation Hours with other Institutions".A total of 214.24 whole-time equivalent teaching posts have been allocated to this service for the 2003-04 school year. The allocation to the prison service in the Dublin area for the 2003-04 school year is 81.98 wholetime equivalent teacher posts. The allocation to the service in Dublin for the 2002-03 school year was 85.55 wholetime equivalent teacher posts. The allocation of teaching resources under the co-operation heading has to be managed within the overall teaching resource available to my Department and in the context of the cap on public sector numbers generally. This inevitably requires prioritisation in the utilisation of available resources. In this context, I am satisfied that the very small reduction in the allocation to the Prison Service is not unreasonable and I understand that arrangements have been made within the service to maintain a satisfactory level of programme delivery for the coming year.

The action group's report was published in July 2001.Department expenditure on third level access measures since 2001 has been as follows: 2001, €15.3 million; 2002, €23.98 million; 2003, €26 million – provisional.The most significant spending recommendation of the report of the action group on access to third level education concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year. Following a review early in 2002, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to €4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and to €1,600 for students residing within 15 miles of college. This was equivalent to a top-up of €1,490 and €596 respectively, for eligible students, on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it was expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002-03 would double to 7,000 students. Recent figures show that this target was exceeded with approximately 8,000 students receiving the grant in 2002-03.A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance for partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management, ADM, Limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, administered the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was €1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations. For 2002-03, I increased the provision for the fund to €2 million. ADM Limited, which is continuing to administer the fund, made allocations to 50 area partnerships and community groups in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.The report of the action group on access to third level education set out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 71 together.As the Deputies will be aware, the report, which was published in August 2003, was the outcome of a review of student support arrangements, undertaken, at my request, within my Department with the objective of ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made in this area were maximised. It was also designed to provide options, for my consideration, in order to promote greater equity in access to, and participation in, higher education.The Deputies will be aware that I announced, on 25 May 2003, a €42 million support package for disadvantaged students in higher education. In constructing this package of measures, I had regard to the various policy options outlined in chapter four of the report which were developed on the basis of their potential to improve equity of access to higher education.I agree with the report's recognition that young people from lower-income families face social, cultural, educational and financial barriers to participation in higher education and share the report's conclusion that some of these barriers must be addressed in families, schools, communities and in the higher education institutions themselves. The need for an integrated cross-cutting approach is self-evident and is central to my approach to addressing the problems of education disadvantage at all levels and this is reflected in the various initiatives which I have taken since assuming office in mid-2002.

The detailed consequences arising from this decision in terms of appointments of teachers and other staff in the education sector have not yet been finalised and will have to be further considered in the context of the ongoing Estimates process.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	366	No alterations have been made to the rates applicable to participants attending in career development programmes. The rates of expenses are set out in the incareer development unit's circular and the current rates have been in effect since 1 January 2002. In respect of elective in-career programmes, that is programmes offered outside of school time, the incareer development unit of my Department endeavours to support such training subject to the suitability of the course and to the overall demand for financial support from across the primary and post-primary sectors. In this regard the unit may make a subvention towards reasonable expenses incurred by course/event organisers or may make payments in accordance with other approved  arrangements. This approach in supporting such programmes has not changed.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The 2002 NESF report on early school leaving estimated that approximately 1,000 children do not transfer from primary to post-primary on an annual basis. My Department is currently completing analysis work on the development of a primary pupils database. A project team, overseen by a steering group, has been assigned to work on the development of this key resource, which will facilitate the collation of comprehensive data on transfer rates in the future. A number of programmes operate at both primary and post-primary level that are designed to tackle the problem of early school leaving. The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Expenditure on this programme in 2003 will be in excess of €17 million.A key role in this regard is also played by the home/school/community liaison scheme, which has been extended to each of the 311 designated disadvantaged primary schools in the country. This scheme helps parents to develop their skills as the primary educators of their children and also operates transfer programmes to help primary school pupils to make the transition to post primary level. Expenditure on this scheme will be in the region of €7 million in 2003.The main programme within my Department for tackling the issue of early school leaving is the school completion programme, which was launched in 2002. This incorporates the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level (SSRI). The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving 82 projects (288 primary and 112 post primary schools), parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. Total funding of €23 million has been provided for the programme in 2003.

In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place. Primary schools are given an annual allocation of €3,809 plus €12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to the school infrastructure. In addition, my Department has set-aside a contingency sum of €8.7 million at primary level and €2 million at post-primary level to deal with emergency works, including emergency health and safety works, during 2003.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training (primary) in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs. Students undertaking the bachelor of education degree or the graduate diploma in education (primary teaching) in St. Patrick's and Mary Immaculate Colleges of Education now follow a course module on special education. This module covers the broad range of issues in special education.In the Church of Ireland and Coláiste Mhuire, Marino Colleges of Education, particular attention is paid to special needs and learning difficulties arising from various factors under Method Studies in English and Mathematics. In the case of the Froebel College of Education, students have a course module under Remedial Work. This deals with learning difficulties arising from special needs.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) comprises a schedule of commitments entered into by WTO members which indicate their level of commitment to market access and national treatment across the full range of service sector activities, including the supply by professionals of legal services. EU member state commitments under the GATS date from completion of the Uruguay Round. Currently, Ireland has no commitments in the GATS schedule in relation to professional legal services under the criminal justice system.The launch of a new trade round in Doha, Qatar, in November 2001 resulted in the commencement of a review of current commitments by means of a request and offer process among WTO members. The European Union for its part has addressed requests for further service sector commitments to its WTO partners and submitted an initial offer to the EU's WTO partners with respect to improved commitments on entry to the European market for third country service providers. A summary of the main features of the EUs GATS offer, including the area of professional legal services, was concluded and submitted to the WTO, in April 2003, and is available is available on the EU's Directorate General for Trade website at http://europa.eu.int/comm/trade/ issues/sectoral/services/index en.htmThe EU initial GATS offer contains proposed new commitments in the area of legal services. Under this conditional offer, the sectoral coverage of legal services commitments has been broadened so that foreign lawyers and law firms can establish in any ember state and provide legal services in respect of the law of any country in which those lawyers are qualified. This means that it would be necessary for a person to qualify as a solicitor and/or barrister in Ireland in order to be able to provide legal services in respect of Irish law. The practice of Irish criminal law would be subject to admission to the Bar in Ireland.

The live register figures are monitored by the local FÁS employment services office.A number of prominent companies in the electronics, internationally traded services and software sectors have established operations in the Tallaght area and are continuing to expand their operations. Recently, Google and Overture, two world renowned high-tech companies, decided to locate in the area. A Japanese pharmaceuticals company has begun construction of a plant in Grangecastle, Clondalkin, which will employ 60 people. A new biotechnology facility in Grangecastle, Clondalkin, employs 500 people which is expected to increase to 1,300 by 2005.Enterprise Ireland has approved funding so far this year for 14 projects in the Tallaght area. The agency has also approved funding towards the cost of a new campus innovation centre at the Tallaght Institute of Technology. At the micro-enterprise level, the South Dublin County Enterprise Board continues to provide a comprehensive range of supports and training.The State agencies will continue to promote the Tallaght area for industrial development. However, the decision on where a particular project locates rests with the promoter of the project.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	375	There is no evidence to suggest that there will be any change in the cost of insurance to employers as a consequence of the proposed smoking ban in the workplace. If the Deputy has any information to suggest otherwise perhaps he will bring it to my attention.
Question No. 85 answered with Question No. 77.




#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	376	The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October 2002 comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the  functioning of the insurance market. The key measures include; implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe – to date 23 of the recommendations have been implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board – the Government has approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the PIAB on a statutory footing and it is hoped to enact the legislation by year-end; and my Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of other measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents, to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law in relation to personal injury claims.While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be undertaken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses. In this regard it is heartening to report that a number of insurers have announced reductions in motor insurance premia. As implementation of the reform programme continues, in particular the reform of the law on personal injuries and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, I expect reductions to occur in all forms of insurance including public liability.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	377	A claim for a statutory redundancy lump sum has not been received in my Department in respect of the person concerned. Sick leave alone is not a reason for redundancy. However, an employee can be made redundant while on sick  leave. If she wishes to claim a redundancy lump sum from her employer, she should do so in writing on form RP77.If her employer fails to pay her the statutory redundancy lump sum but gives her the necessary forms to claim the payment from the social insurance fund, I can arrange to have the lump sum paid to her direct from the social insurance fund. If her employer refuses to give her the necessary forms to claim from the fund, it is then open to her to bring a claim against her employer before the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a decision in the matter. Form T1-A must be used for this purpose. If the tribunal finds in her favour, I can arrange for the payment of the lump sum to be made direct to her out of the social insurance fund on foot of the tribunal order.I have arranged for these forms to be sent directly to the person concerned. Form P45 is a tax form and perhaps the person concerned could get in touch with her local tax office regarding this matter.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	381	On the basis of a review of the Diseases of Animals Acts 1966 to 2001 undertaken by my Department in the latter part of 2002 and early this year, I have already secured Government approval for the heads of a Bill, which will replace and update that legislation. My Department is now engaged in drafting work, which will in due course be finalised by the office of the parliamentary counsel to the Government. My aim is to be in a position to publish what will be termed the animal health Bill by mid 2004.I have no plans to review the 45-day rule, which is an element of section 29A of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966. The proposed legislation will re-enact section 29A.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I have been concerned for some time about the whole issue of food labelling and for this reason established a widely representative group to examine the matter which reported to me on 10 December 2002. On the basis of the recommendations of the food labelling group I took a number of actions which included: arranging for the centralisation of control of food labelling in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; pursuing with the European Commission the question of extending the beef labelling regulations to the catering sector; asking the consumer liaison panel to carry out market research to identify consumer requirements on the origin of meat, including beef.While it is the case that beef imports to this country constitute a very small fraction of our overall production and exports, it is absolutely essential that EU labelling requirements be applied to all beef sold on the domestic market, irrespective of origin.Where there is evidence that these requirements are not adhered to, then the agency responsible for controlling the particular sector and for implementing the legislation should take the appropriate action.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	383	An application for premium for 12 animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme was lodged on 4 March 2002. Payment of the 80% advance instalment issued to the applicant on 18 October 2002. The district livestock office of my Department has since been informed that the applicant is now deceased and the person named is now the registered herdowner. The 2002 suckler cow application has been processed fully for balancing payment. The solicitors in charge of the estate were contacted with regard to submitting the relevant documents to allow payment to be released. It is expected that this case will be finalised shortly.The applicant participated in 2002 extensification premium opting for the simplified system for the purposes of determining eligibility. He chose to observe a stocking density of 1.8 livestock units or less per hectare for each and every day of 2002. Under the terms of the relevant regulation, prior to payment, the Department is required to carry out stocking density cross-checks against the CMMS animal database to ensure that the stocking densities as chosen were not breached. Cross-checks were carried out on 19 May and 15 September 2002 at which respective stocking densities of 1.9113 and 1.9645 livestock units per hectare were established. These stocking densities were calculated also taking into account a 19.5 livestock unit value attributable to the 130 ewes that qualified for payment of 2002 ewe premium on the holding which itself consisted of 22.55 hectares.A CMMS based herd profile showing by livestock unit value the eartag number and date of birth of each bovine animal over the age of six months present on the holding on both dates cross-checked issued to the person named recently. Unless the person named can show that there are discrepancies on the herd profile, he cannot be considered for payment of 2002 extensification premium in view of the fact that the stocking densities found exceeded 1.8 livestock units per hectare on the dates the cross-checks took place.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 to 96, inclusive, together.Earlier this week, following protracted negotiations over many months with Commissioner Fischler and his officials, I secured a very satisfactory resolution of the difficulty that arose for particular farmers as a result of the overshoot of the special beef premium in 2002. In recognition of the particular circumstances that gave rise to the overshoot, the Commission has allocated €6.4 million each year, which will be incorporated into the single payments of the farmers affected by the overshoot.Under EU regulations, the once-off penalty that was imposed on the farmers concerned could not be changed retrospectively. That penalty amounted to some €25 million. The solution I have negotiated will result in increased annual payments into the future and for as long as the new system of direct payments applies. It will therefore amount to a far greater cumulative sum than the actual cost of the penalty. I am satisfied that the increased annual payments stretching into the future that result from this agreement will be far more beneficial than the remission of a once-off penalty and represents a fair and equitable solution for all concerned.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	385	The agreement reached by the Council of Ministers on 26 June 2003 on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy provided, in the case of cattle, sheep and arable crops, for full decoupling of direct payments and for a number of options for partial decoupling. In early July I launched a consultation process in which I invited the social partners and the wider public to submit their views on the most appropriate arrangements to apply in the Irish context. I am examining the submissions received at present with a view to  making a decision on these sectors in the near future.In the case of direct payments in the dairy sector, while the relevant Council regulation provides for full decoupling only, it allows certain discretion to member states to decide on the timing of its introduction. In the interests of clarity, and to allow producers to take informed decisions in the period ahead about the sale and acquisition of quota and land and associated investment decisions, and having taken into account the views expressed to me by representatives of dairy producers, I have decided that full decoupling in the dairy sector should take effect from 1 January 2005. In order to ensure a consistent approach across the sectors, I have decided that the arrangements in the cattle, sheep and arable sectors, when decided upon, will also apply from 1 January 2005.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	386	An appeal has been received in this case and is under active consideration at present. A decision will be made shortly and will be conveyed to the persons concerned.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The Department of Agriculture and Food currently employs 4,815 staff. The 1,246 staff employed by Teagasc, Bord Glas and Bord Bia are also covered by the benchmarking agreement.The projected cost for benchmarking for 2004 is €10.8 million, of which €8.2 million relates to the Department of Agriculture and Food and €2.6 million relates to Teagasc, Bord Glas and Bord Bia.Payment of the benchmarking as well as other general round pay increases, is dependent upon: verification of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change; satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation; maintenance of stable industrial relations; and absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by Sustaining Progress.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	388	The number of freedom of information requests received in my Department during each week from January 2003 to date is as follows:
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	389	The person named included two land parcels on his 2003 area aid application in respect of which overclaims were determined. The area  aid unit has written to the person named in this regard and a reply is awaited. Until this matter is resolved his area aid application cannot be fully processed and no area related payments can issue.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	390	There is no delay in my Department in dealing with this case. The current rules relating to transfer are that if a person wishes to transfer deliveries from his or her existing milk purchaser to a new purchaser he or she must formally notify both purchasers of the intention to transfer. Deliveries to the new purchaser may begin only from the start of the second quarter after the date of notification.When deliveries to the new purchaser have commenced, that purchaser has a period of two months to apply to the Minister for an appropriate adjustment to its overall milk quota to take account of the new quota being transferred. To date no such application has been received in this case, and hence the issue of a delay does not arise.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The holding of the person named was selected for an on-the-spot inspection. Inspection process found an overclaim on one parcel of land. His area aid application has now been fully processed with an adjusted forage area of 7.36 hectares. Payment due under the 2003 area-based compensatory allowance scheme will issue shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I understand that according to my Departments records, the person named has no  eligible animals under the 2003 slaughter premium scheme.

The officer concerned is No. 31 on the staff officer list for Naas, County Kildare.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	394	The person named had included commonage land in her REPS plan to which another person also claims entitlement. Neither person can supply proof of ownership and they have not availed of an opportunity to submit a joint affidavit covering the lands in question. My Department cannot adjudicate on conflicting claims of land ownership. The affidavit provided by the person named, which is to the effect that she has been in undisputed occupation of the lands for the previous five years, does not resolve the issue. REPS payments on the disputed area cannot be made.The matter has been appealed to the agriculture appeals office and I understand that my Department's position has been upheld. I understand however that the case is now under review by the director of the office at the request of the person named.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 112 together.Tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984 under the business expansion scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector specific tax reliefs in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution in terms of tax forgone of the order of some €265 million in the past ten years alone. It should be noted that this relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally. In budget 2003, I referred to the generally accepted principle that such reliefs narrow the tax base and that a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to retain the current low tax rates. Consequently, all tax reliefs must be subject to ongoing review. In that context, I announced in the budget that a number of these reliefs across a range of sectors, including film relief, would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The effect of the proposed workplace smoking ban on tax receipts will be reviewed in assessing the prospects for tax revenues for budget 2004. The relevant factors in this regard will include: whether the ban leads to less tobacco and alcohol consumption and, if so, whether the money involved will be spent on other taxable goods and services. My Department will be seeking to quantify this possible impact on tax revenues, as far as this can be done, in the run-up to the budget.As regards Exchequer payments or spending, it is not anticipated that the proposed ban will impact in the short-term. However, the consequential reduction in passive smoking should result in a healthier population, which in itself should reduce the burden on certain health services in the medium to long-term.

The Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No 25) Order 1993 (SI No. 266 of 1993) provides for the refund of  VAT incurred by farmers in connection with certain construction costs for the purposes of a farming business.All weather gallops relate specifically to horse training, which is not regarded as a farming activity for VAT purposes. Accordingly, the claim was refused and the claimant was informed accordingly.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	403	There is widespread and increasing concern about the problem of trafficking in human beings throughout Europe and work is under way in several international bodies to find effective and sus tainable ways to tackle this complex human rights problem. In July 2003, the 55 participating states of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, meeting in permanent council, adopted an action plan to combat human trafficking. The plan envisages improved co-operation between governments in the prevention of trafficking, the prosecution of perpetrators, and the protection of their victims and gives clear guidance to participating states on how to implement the plan's provisions.Discussions are currently under way at official level in Vienna to find agreement on how to enable the OSCE to bring the plan's provisions forward, in co-operation with the member states. I look forward to a successful conclusion to those discussions, in time for the OSCE ministerial council on 1 and 2 December 2003 in Maastricht when it is intended that the action plan in trafficking will be endorsed by the council. I will arrange for a copy of the action plan to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.In the Council of Europe, work has begun in September on a Council of Europe convention on trafficking in human beings aimed at setting up a joint observatory in trafficking. The European Union has also been actively engaged since 1996 on this issue. The Brussels Declaration, drafted at the European conference on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings in September 2002, sets out the EU's aims in this field, namely, the further development of European and international co-operation in the fields of prevention, victim protection and police and judicial co-operation to achieve a reduction in human trafficking. I will also arrange for a copy of the Brussels Declaration to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The accession of Cyprus to the EU on 1 May 2004 offers an historic opportunity for the achievement of a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, based on the proposals of the UN Secretary General. I hope that this opportunity will be grasped and that it will prove possible for a united Cyprus to join the EU during Ireland's Presidency.Following the failure of UN-sponsored negotiations in March this year, the European Council in March and in June reaffirmed the EU's strong support for a comprehensive settlement within the framework of Secretary General Kofi Annan's proposals. The Thessaloniki European Council in June noted that the accession of Cyprus is already creating favourable conditions for the two communities to reach a comprehensive settlement. It reiterated the willingness of the EU to accommodate the terms of a settlement in line with the principles on which the Union is founded.

This number includes 75 officers temporarily assigned to the Department in connection with Ireland's forthcoming EU Presidency.The salaries of some 460 officers are not subject to benchmarking. These include clerical and other support staff employed by Irish diplomatic missions and development staff attached to aid missions or projects whose pay is determined with reference to local conditions, and officers at assistant secretary level and higher.The Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, a body under the aegis of the Department, employs 19 staff whose salaries are subject to benchmarking.It is estimated that payment of 50% of the benchmarking awards in January to the approximately 1,174 Department and APSO officers to whom the scheme applies will cost €2.7 million in 2004.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The Government shares the widespread concerns about the revelations of financial irregularities in EUROSTAT and the concern of citizens across the European Union that funds are expended in a proper and transparent manner.The Government fully supports the commitment of the President of the European Commission to ensuring that the Commission co-operates fully with ongoing investigations into this matter. Since his appointment as President of the Commission in 1999, Romano Prodi has introduced a series of measures and regulations governing financial expenditure, which include granting the Commission's anti-fraud investigative unit, OLAF, full autonomy. The financial irregularities at EUROSTAT appear to predate the appointment of the current Commission's term of office and the Commission believes that it is improbable that this type of irregularity could recur under its new financial and administrative procedures. The Government welcomes all initiatives to combat financial irregularities and will continue to support the Commission in its efforts to eliminate any instances of financial impropriety.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	409	The accession to the EU on 1 May 2004 of ten new member states is not expected to affect the status of the Irish language in the Union. The Irish language is an EU treaty language. In practice this has meant that each successive treaty is published in Irish as well as in the 11 other treaty languages, with the texts in Irish being equally authentic and having equal status with those in all other languages.The new constitutional treaty, which is to be agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference that opens in Rome on 4 October, will also be in the Irish language in accordance with these provisions. The draft of the treaty submitted to the European Council in Thessaloníki also included an Irish language version.While Irish is not one of the official working languages of the Union, the Treaty of Amsterdam introduced a provision whereby citizens of the Union may correspond with the Union's institutions referred to in Article 7 of the EC treaty and with the Ombudsman in any of the treaty languages, including Irish, and that they may receive an answer in the same language.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	410	The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill is intended to create a system for access to education for children and young people with educational disabilities that gives effect to established constitutional and statutory rights and  establishes a range of measures for parents and children to vindicate those rights which will not require recourse to the courts.In Donoghue v. the Minister for Education the Supreme Court held that by virtue of Article 42 of the Constitution every child is entitled to an education which gives “each child such advice, instruction and teaching as would enable him to make the best possible use of his inherent and potential capabilities, physical, mental and moral, however limited these capacities might be”. Section 7 of the Education Act 1998 provides that it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure “that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person”. These rights are already enforceable at law by the courts.Section 11 of the Bill will create an easier mechanism for parents of children and young people with educational disabilities to enforce their educational rights if they so wish. Parents, if they feel their views are not being given full recognition, or where they feel their child's educational plan is not being implemented effectively, may appeal any decisions concerning their children and these matters to an independent review board. The board has the power to compel bodies, including health boards to take specific actions to address matters before it. The Bill also provides that the National Council for Special Education and the relevant health board will make all the necessary services available to children and young people with educational disabilities to enable them to participate in, and benefit from, education and, if they fail to do so, the parents of that child or young person can appeal to the appeals board and the board will have the power to compel one or other body to provide necessary services.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.Gaelscoil Uí Cheithearnaigh had an enrolment of 176 pupils on 30 September 2001 which entitled the school to a staffing of principal and seven mainstream class teachers for the 2002-03 school year.The school had 180 pupils on 30 September 2002 which allows for a staffing of a principal and seven mainstream class teachers for the 2003-04 school year. The agreed appointment figure for eighth mainstream class teacher is 193 pupils.The school also has a shared learning support teacher, a resource teacher and in the 2002-03 school year had a temporary post to assist with space difficulties at the school.An independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. A circular outlining these new procedures issued to all primary schools.The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2003-04 school year was considered by the appeals board and I understand that the board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board in April 2003.The large-scale building project for Gaelscoil Uí Cheithearnaigh is listed in section 6 of the 2003 school building programme which is published on my Department's website at www.education.ie This project is at stage 4/5 of architectural planning (detailed design/contract documents).

I would of course be happy to provide information for specific individual schools. In relation to the general position on projects throughout the country, the Deputy is aware of the 2003 school building programme that was published earlier this year and which provides information for all the partners in education.The major investment of recent years in upgrading school accommodation has resulted in new and enhanced school accommodation throughout the country. In the five years, up to and including 2002, a total of €1,248 million has been spent by my Department on primary and post-primary school buildings. This is a very significant amount of investment. The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started, and to consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made, in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time.

The board was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case.The board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board in April. The decision of the appeals board is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeals Board.

I am on record as acknowledging that the significant levels of investment made in school buildings in recent years need to be maintained going forward if the goal of eliminating substandard accommodation is to be achieved. To that end, in the context of the Estimates process, I am seeking to put in place a multiannual capital funding envelope for the next four to five years. I consider that the provision of such an envelope for the school building programme will enable my Department to provide greater clarity for all education partners concerning the progress of projects within the programme.The major investment of recent years in upgrading school accommodation has resulted in new and enhanced school accommodation throughout the country. In the five years, up to and including 2002, a total of €1,248 million has been spent by my Department on primary and post-primary school buildings. This is a very significant amount of investment. The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in the agreed programme for Government.

Responsibility for the management and delivery of these projects is devolved to school management authorities. The majority of these prefabricated structures are expected to be on site this year.My Department, as part of the update of the building programme, introduced in May a new pilot initiative aimed at reducing the requirement for temporary accommodation in primary schools. Some 20 schools were invited to participate in the pilot phase of this initiative which allows them to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs. Responsibility for the management and delivery of these projects is devolved to school management authorities with the bulk of the building projects currently at planning permission stage. It is hoped to build on this initiative in future years.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The issue of pupil-teacher ratio is under constant review by my Department as it affects the size of classes in schools and the provision of support teachers.The ratio has decreased significantly in primary schools in recent years. For example, it fell from 26.6:1 in 1990-91 to 19:1 in 2001-02. A decrease does not automatically result in improved pupil achievements. Although the ratio fell from 29.1:1 to 22.1:1 between 1980 and 1998 no improvement was recorded in the reading achievements of fifth class pupils.In the light of evidence from other countries that, under certain conditions, a significant reduction in class size can be beneficial in junior classes serving pupils in disadvantaged areas, my Department sanctioned the reduction of class size to 15 pupils in schools in the breaking the cycle scheme. In addition, the giving children an even break initiative allowed for junior class sizes of 20 pupils in the schools with the greatest levels of educational disadvantage.

If it is the case that the Deputy wishes to seek other specific correspondence perhaps he would submit details to the unit.

As time went on it became increasingly obvious that this would not happen. There were many reasons, but primarily the issue rests with the fact that, far from being a relatively informal forum, the investigation committee assumed the formality of the High Court, complete with teams of lawyers.Following the final deadline for receipt of statements in July 2002 the commission indicated that the total applications to the committee was 1957. In November 2002 the commission stated in a memorandum to my Department that, even assuming some level of attrition in the number of complainants to be heard by it, it would not be in a position to deliver its final report for at least a further eight to 11 years. This timeframe was provided to my Department by the commission and was based on the resources that it had at that time. It would be far too late for many of those for whom it was established.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I assume the Deputy is referring to financial redress awards to be made by the RIRB.My Department estimates that the cost of awards over the three-year duration of the redress board will be in the region of between €400 million and €500 million. This would accommodate between 4,000 and 5,000 claimants at an average award of €100,000. To date the board has received approximately 2,000 applications and it continues to receive applications at a rate of approximately 50 per week. The board has made settlements or offered awards in approximately 200 cases with the average payment being approximately €80,745.No matter what method is used to estimate the overall financial liability that may be incurred the figure arrived at is an estimate. It is only as the board continues to operate and the rate of applications and level of awards become more established that a clearer picture as to the overall financial liability will be available.The previous Government agreed to set up a redress scheme, irrespective of the financial liability that may be incurred in the operation of such a scheme, because it considered that it was the correct course of action to be followed in ensuring redress for persons who, as children, had been abused in institutions. This continues to be the view of the present Government. I remain committed, in common with my Government colleagues, to ensuring that through the redress scheme and other initiatives in this area survivors of abuse are assisted in reaching some form of closure in relation to past events.

In attendance were the child's father, all five members of the Midlands Autism Support Team, the school principal, a resource teacher and special needs assistant and two members of national educational psychological service. The conclusion was that, in view of the child's reported progress, it was not considered that she was in need of an extra allocation of resources at that time.At present she has an allocation of five hours resource teaching support, a full-time special needs assistant and funding has been made available to the school for a computer under the IT 2000 initiative. She also availed of 40 hours home tuition for the month of July in 2002 and 2003.

She is in receipt of five resource teaching hours per week in view of her diagnosed disability. An individual education plan has been put in place for her by the trained personnel in the school and it is reviewed on a twice yearly basis. The NEPS psychologist was available for the review consultation held in June and met her parents.An educational psychological assessment is only carried out on children who are failing to make progress in learning, following consultation with the school personnel. In this case the girl is making good progress and meeting the targets set in the IEP. In view of this the school has not made a request for further educational psychological assessment. The support and advice of the NEPS psychologist in relation to this person continues to be available to the school on request.

The team has been providing an inservice support programme since that time.Some vacancies have arisen on the team this year. The posts were advertised and a competition held. It has not been possible to fill the particular posts as yet since, among other factors, there were not sufficient suitable candidates. Religious education is now being made available as an examination subject at leaving certificate level and seven schools are participating in the initial phase. A person has been appointed at national co-ordinator level to provide a support service for these schools.The Department is considering merging the junior and leaving certificate support personnel into a single team and the appointment of regional development officers to the team.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	460	Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.The school in question applied for a curricular concession allocation and was allocated 2.36 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. The school was notified of this allocation in April and advised that, in the event of its not being satisfied with this allocation, it could appeal in writing before 6 May to the independent appeals committee. The school did not avail of the appeals mechanism.The total staffing allocation to the school for the current school year is 14.42 whole-time equivalent teacher posts and three special needs assistants. This allocation includes one disadvantaged area post and half of a whole-time equivalent teacher post in respect of home-school-community liaison. This level of allocation leaves the school with a pupil-teacher ratio of 7.8:1.

When recognition was granted the school's patron body, Educate Together, was made aware that it was likely that a period of seven to ten years could elapse before permanent accommodation would be provided. This is due to the enor mity of demand, including demands for permanent accommodation, within the system. It was further pointed out that it would remain the patron's responsibility to provide interim accommodation until my Department would be in a position to provide permanent accommodation. My Department assists in defraying the cost of rent incurred.The patron's proposals for accommodating the school were examined as part of the recognition process. They involved locating the school in a local scouts den pending the outcome of negotiations to lease a suitable site on which portacabins could be erected. It was stated that these negotiations were at an advanced stage. My Department's planning section expressed reservations at these proposals given that the scouts den could provide only a short-term solution and given my Department's concern that negotiations to secure accommodation that would provide a more medium-term solution were incomplete.My Department decided to grant provisional recognition, accepting in good faith, that the patron body had arrangements in hand to accommodate the expected expansion of the school. As is the case for all schools granted provisional recognition, the patron and board of management were instructed to implement an enrolment policy that would permit growth commensurate with the available accommodation.Regretfully, the patron body was unable to secure the accommodation solution originally proposed. An alternative site, in the ownership of Fingal County Council at Ballisk, was sourced. This arrangement was deemed satisfactory and my Department approved the rental of portacabins and associated site costs.In recent weeks it appears that the county council had decided to dispose of the Ballisk site resulting in the option of accommodating the school on it being no longer feasible.On Friday, 26 September, an alternative proposal was received from the school authorities. My Department was considering this. Yesterday it was brought to the attention of my Department that the council had rescinded its decision to dispose of the Ballisk site and that it was again prepared to make the site available to the school. The school authority is in renewed discussions with the council and it expects to be in a position to sign a lease for this site shortly. My Department had already agreed to grant aid the costs of portacabins for this site together with the associated site costs. This remains the position.

Through fostering self-review and improvement, school development planning makes an important contribution to quality assurance in the educational system. Primary schools joined the initiative on a phased basis since September 1999. Inservice training in school development planning has been provided for all primary schools since September 2002.

Of these some 780 applications schools in respect of new entrants were prioritised in an effort to ensure resources were in place to enable these children to access the education system. In some instances delays occurred because no supporting professional reports were provided. Where my officials were made aware of particular difficulties surrounding the attendance at school of a new entrant pupil, supporting documentation was sought and applications processed as a matter of urgency.The remaining 4,720 applications are now being processed. A dedicated team of psychologists and inspectors has been established for that purpose. While the process will be complex and time consuming, every effort will be made to notify schools of the outcome at the earliest possible date.At present it would not be possible to predict the outcome in terms of resource teacher and special needs assistant posts. Already in excess of 2,300 resource teacher posts and almost 5,500 full and part-time special needs assistant posts have been approved for primary schools since the automatic response to SEN was introduced in 1999.The number of learning support teachers now stands at 1,531 enabling a learning support service to be accessed by every primary school pupil in the country. I have no plans to expand the learning the service at this time.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 to 215, inclusive, together.As a result of regulations to be introduced by the Minister for Health and Children, smoking is to be prohibited in all places of work, including licensed premises and restaurants with effect from January 2004 to protect employees and the public from exposure to the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke. The announcement of the public health initiative has brought about a substantial public debate on the issue of passive smoking and the damaging effects to health generally. A number of opinion polls, surveys and other studies have also been conducted in recent months into the social and economic consequences of the ban on smoking in the workplace.To gain a better understanding of the potential impact of the proposed prohibition on smoking in pubs and restaurants on tourism, Tourism Ireland sought the opinion of its market based staff and a representative sample of the overseas market trade on the impact of such a ban. The outcome of that research was that the proposed ban would not have a dramatic effect on visitor numbers to Ireland unless there was widespread negative publicity attached to the ban. However, even the impact of the latter is considered likely to be short-term. In addition, most third party research identified by Tourism Ireland including studies from Australia, the US, Canada and Hong Kong, unequivocally concluded that such bans have had no significant negative impact on tourist arrivals, with many identifying a positive long-term impact.

I am aware that the reduction in funding for the Arts Council in 2003 called for difficult decisions by council which have included making reductions in funding in some cases and that this caused much concern for those affected. The funding to be provided to the council in 2004 will be decided through the forthcoming Estimates process in the context of which I will be making the best possible case for the funding of the arts and the council.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	495	As explained to the Deputy in my reply to his previous parliamentary question on this issue, in 1999 my Department asked the National Disease  Surveillance Centre (NDSC) to evaluate the problem of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland and to formulate a strategy for the future. The NDSC gave detailed consideration to these issues and drew up a strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland (SARI), which I launched on 19 June 2001. This report contains a wide range of detailed recommendations to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance, including a strategy to control the inappropriate use of antibiotics. The SARI recommendations can be grouped into five main categories: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance; monitoring of the supply and use of antimicrobials; development of guidance in relation to the appropriate use of antimicrobials; education of health care workers, patients and the general public and development of principles in relation to infection control in the hospital and community setting.The strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland recommended that a national SARI committee be established to develop guidelines, protocols and strategies in relation to antimicrobial resistance. This committee was established in late 2002 and as part of its remit provides advice to the regional SARI committees in each health board area which were established as a result of the strategy's recommendations. The national SARI committee is comprised of a wide range of experts in the field.Tackling the problem of antimicrobial resistance is a multi-faceted issue which will require action on a number of fronts. Implementation of the strategy is taking place on a phased basis and will take a number of years to complete. To date approximately €12 million has been allocated by my Department to health boards to enable them to put in place measures to control antimicrobial resistance. It is ultimately a matter for each health board chief executive officer to determine the priorities in each region. These priorities should take account of the recommendations in the SARI report and also the recommendations put forward by each regional SARI committee.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Officials of my Department, including the chief medical officer, have met with representatives of the Irish ME Trust, both this year and last year. The Department's chief medical officer has pointed out the limitations on the health care system's ability to provide a full range of services to those who are already diagnosed with CFS/ME. These limitations are the same as for those who suffer from other chronic diseases. The allocation of resources needs to be based on priority health needs and on evidence as to what interventions  are seen to be most effective in combating these conditions.There are limitations on the capacity of the health care system to respond to demands for increased or additional services. It is, therefore, difficult in the current circumstances to identify funding to establish specialised units for CFS/ME sufferers.I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to keep the issue of providing services to CFS/ME sufferers under review, taking account, in particular, of the experience of initiatives in other countries.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I met with the Diabetes Federation of Ireland last week to discuss issues arising from the federation's report, Diabetes: Securing the Future. It was agreed that a working group representative of the federation and my Department would be established to consider how best diabetic services can be improved nationally. The question of additional funds to establish diabetes clinics throughout the country is a matter for further consideration in this context, and having regard to the level of health service funding in 2004 and subsequent years.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The number of people employed in my Department at the end of 2002 was 645 in whole-time equivalent terms. There were 95,679 employed in the wider health service (health boards, voluntary hospitals and intellectual disability homes), and 1,878 employed in the specialists agencies under the aegis of my Department. The specialist agencies under the aegis of my Department are set out in the table.A sum of €188.194 million has been provided for the payment of the second phase of the Public Service Benchmarking Body's pay recommendations to eligible staff in the health sector in 2004. This sum is in addition to the €90.3 million allocated in 2003 for the first phase. This allocation covers the staff employed within my Department, the wider health service, specialist agencies and the grant-funded voluntary sector.As the Deputy is aware payment of benchmarking is strictly contingent on the completion of the performance verification process of the health service modernisation programme as set out in Sustaining Progress, which is currently under way.Specialist agencies under the aegis of the Department of Health and ChildrenAn Bord AltranaisBlood Transfusion Service BoardBoard for the Employment of the BlindDental CouncilDisability Federation of IrelandFood Safety Authority of IrelandGeneral Medical Services Payments BoardHealth Research BoardHealth Service Employers AgencyHEBEHospital Bodies Administrative BureauIrish Medicines BoardNational Association of Mental Handicapped of IrelandNational Breast Screening ProgrammeNational Cancer Registry BoardNational Council for Ageing and Older PeopleNational Council for Planning and Development of Nursing and MidwiferyNational Social Work Qualifications BoardOffice for Health ManagementOffice for Tobacco ControlPostgraduate Medical and Dental BoardPre-Hospital Emergency Care CouncilVoluntary Health Insurance Board

There has been a reduction in the number of non-personal FOI requests to the Department this year. However, it should be noted that the rate of receipt of FOI requests tends to show unpredictable peaks and troughs,  so it is not be possible to draw any firm conclusions about this trend at this time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	501	The owner, occupier or person in charge of a licensed premises is legally responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety requirements as well as a range of other legislation relating, for example, to fire safety, food hygiene and the control of the sale of alcohol and tobacco products to underage persons.As part of the process of monitoring compliance with health and safety requirements authorised officers from the health boards and Office of Tobacco Control will visit licensed premises as part of their enforcement duties.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The decision to proceed with a ban on smoking in workplaces, following the publication in January last of the report on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace, was made in the context of my responsibilities as Minister for Health and Children and having regard to the provisions of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002. The Health and Safety Authority is a separate statutory body which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment: it also responded to this report and is proposing to institute separate statutory measures and this will facilitate enforcement arrangements.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	503	The consensus of informed scientific and medical opinion is that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a carcinogen. Accordingly, any litigation involving exposure to ETS is more likely to be based on this consensus rather than on a decision by the Government to so designate ETS.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	504	The figure of 7,500 is the most recent estimate based on direct deaths from smoking plus deaths related to passive smoking.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	505	While estimates in this area vary according to the  nature and context of epidemiological studies carried out, there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of deaths and of illness. I am satisfied that the measures I am introducing to protect against exposure to environmental tobacco smoke are justifiable and necessary. I do not have information available on the deaths by the particular categories mentioned and it is important to note that an appropriate response on an important public health issue does not depend on the availability of detailed estimates of fatalities in respect of individual locations.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	506	I have not formulated any estimate on the lines referred to by the Deputy. From a public health viewpoint even one death caused by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is regrettable as death and illness from the inhalation of toxic environmental tobacco smoke is entirely preventible. The measures I am taking to protect people from tobacco smoke in the workplace will contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.It is important to note that an appropriate response on an important public health issue does not depend on the generation of detailed estimates of fatalities in respect of individual employment groups.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	507	My primary concern in introducing a ban on the smoking of tobacco in all workplaces is to protect workers and the public from exposure to toxic environmental tobacco smoke which is a cause of disease and ill health. Being able to work and socialise in a clean and healthy environment will have health benefits for all. Clearly, reductions in the incidence of illnesses associated with the inhalation of tobacco smoke will translate into savings in health care costs associated with treating tobacco related illness. It is not possible at this stage to quantify what these savings are likely to be and it is important to note that while savings in health care costs are to be welcomed, the likelihood of such savings being generated was not a factor in my decision.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	508	It would not be more cost effective to divert savings from the proposed non-enforcement of effective measures designed to ensure the safety and health of workers to a communications campaign as is suggested by the Deputy.In any event, such campaigns are an ongoing feature of the anti-tobacco campaign and will continue in tandem with other measures, including the proposed ban of smoking in the workplace and its associated enforcement. Other recent measures taken in the area of tobacco control include: the age limit for sale of cigarettes to persons has been raised from 16 to 18 years; advertising of tobacco products in newspapers and magazines has been ended; sponsorship of events by the tobacco industry has been ended; nicotine replacement therapy was made available to all medical card holders who smoke; the national "Break the Habit Campaign" was developed on a partnership basis between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards; additional smoking cessation officers have been recruited by health boards; sustained media advertising campaigns directed at preventing young people, in particular young women, from taking up smoking; and new larger health warnings on packets of cigarettes – 30% on front of packet & 40% on back of packet.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	509	As the Deputy may be aware, I launched the influenza vaccination campaign 2003-04 on 24 September 2003.Many respiratory diseases occur every winter but influenza is one of the most severe. The World Health Organisation states that influenza typically infects 10% to 20% of the total population during seasonal epidemics, resulting in between three and five million cases of severe illness and at least 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year worldwide.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	510	The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. My Department has, therefore, written to the chief executive officers of the health boards and the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority asking for a report on the issue. This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is received.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	511	As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the provision of health services in the Kildare area rests with the South-Western Area Health Board acting under the aegis of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has been informed by the area health board that 40 patients are accommodated in the community unit in Maynooth, which opened in 2002. The board also advises that it is planned that the remaining five beds will be brought into use in 2004.

The review has addressed all of the relevant issues and has been pursued  against the background of, among other things, plans to provide for the metrication of speed limits by the end of 2004 and the fact that the last review of speed limits was carried out some ten years ago.

The RPA has informed me that while it has no plans to extend the Luas line from the Square through Old Bawn into the Tallaght west estates and onto the City West campus, it is keeping the situation under review, in line with the Dublin Transportation Office strategy document A Platform for Change.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	517	Construction of the Luas line from Tallaght to Connolly Station – line A/C – is progressing and significant milestones for the project have already been achieved. The depot at Red Cow is now complete and the 26 trams for the Tallaght line have been delivered. Testing and commissioning of part of the system has commenced. Most, if not all, of the main engineering works are expected to be completed by the end of the year. Passenger services will commence in August 2004.In relation to the Deputy's concerns about the Red Cow roundabout in the context of Luas, the Railway Procurement Agency has informed me that alignment of the tram path at the roundabout was the subject of detailed discussions with the National Roads Authority and South Dublin County Council prior to the granting of an order to construct the Tallaght to Connolly Station line. This followed detailed consideration at the public inquiry held into the proposals put forward by the then CIE light rail project office, whose work was subsequently taken over by the RPA. The RPA's view is that Luas will have no negative impact on traffic conditions at this roundabout.

The proposals were considered at the line A public inquiry on foot of which a light railway order was made.I understand from the RPA that there will be a park and ride facility which will accommodate 450 cars adjacent to the Tallaght stop, serving Tallaght Square-Town Centre. These car spaces will be provided as part of the development of the former CIE site alongside the Square-Town Centre.I understand from the RPA that ongoing discussions are taking place between the developer and the planning authority with a view to having this facility available as soon as possible.

It is understood that the safety belts in the rear of this vehicle are of a lap only type. I am satisfied that the decision by NCTS not to issue a test certificate for the vehicle in respect of the NCT carried out in August 2003 was correct.Having regard to the seat belt arrangements in this vehicle the issue of a test certificate in 2001 was in error. The matter has been taken up with NCTS by my Department with a view to avoiding similar errors in the future.

All applications for grant assistance undergo a thorough assessment and appraisal process against the programme criteria by Area Development Management Limited. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a recommendation before I make a final decision.The equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 is currently undergoing an independent mid-term review as part of the review of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department is also currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date to ensure that those grant commitments previously entered into will in fact be realised by the groups on the ground. At the same time, it is also reviewing the different budget lines under the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining capital funding in accordance with the objectives of the programme.

It would be premature of me to comment further on specific applications for capital grant assistance at this time.

Dealing number D2002SM006447E refers. I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate a completion date at this stage. However, I assure the Deputy that the application is receiving attention in the Land Registry.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I have been informed by the  Garda authorities that a request for tender, RFT, document for the supply of consultancy services to provide a human rights audit to the Garda Síochána, was issued in accordance with prevailing EU and public procurement regulations and guidelines. The RFT stated that the successful tenderer would be required to: identify the current degree of compliance in the policies and strategies of the Garda Síochána with the values enshrined in international policing practice; identify gaps, if any, in values compliance in Garda policy and strategy; make recommendations for future compliance; draft a comprehensive bibliography on values-led policing practice and policy; provide three bound copies of the findings of the audit and a copy in electronic format; and make a presentation of the findings of the report to senior Garda management.The criteria set out in the RFT for the award of this contract, in order of priority, were: experience and methodology; price; professional competence and resourcing capability of the consultancy provider in the area of human rights analysis and/or auditing for human rights compliance; and presentation. The anticipated cost of the audit is €46,290, including VAT.The audit is being conducted in three stages: stage one – desk based research on Garda policies, strategies and procedures; stage two – interviews with approximately 18 senior Garda management staff, focus groups with staff, several seminars with community groups, a survey of 4,500 Garda and civilian staff by postal questionnaire; and stage three – the results of the research will be codified in a report and presented to senior Garda management. Stages one and two are complete. The report and its findings will be made available to senior management of the Garda Síochána before December 2003. Subject to senior management approval, it is intended to publish the audit report on the Garda website.

The procedure to select a Commissioner and the pool of persons considered is a matter for Government to determine, when the making of such an appointment is required.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The purpose of the Race Directive (2000/43/EC) is to provide a flexible general framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin in both the employment and non-employment areas.Discrimination in relation to employment and in the supply of goods and services on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, which includes race, colour, nationality, or ethnic or national origins, and membership of the Traveller community is already prohibited in Ireland following commencement of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000. Ireland's legislation is already largely in compliance with the race directive.Implementation of the race directive necessitates amendments to both the Employment Equality Act 1998 and to the Equal Status Act 2000. On 9 May 2003 the Government approved the drafting of the Employment Equality and Equal Status (Amendment) Bill, on a priority basis, to implement the race directive and also two further equality directives, namely, the Framework Employment Directive (2000/78/EC) and the Gender Equal Treatment Directive (2002/73/EC) which must be implemented by 2 December 2003 and 5 October 2005, respectively. Furthermore implementation of the directives necessitates amendments to legislation to provide for equality in relation to occupational pensions which will be dealt with by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in the Social Welfare Bill 2004.The Employment Equality and Equal Status (Amendment) Bill is with the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. It is intended to ensure that the provisions of the directives will apply to all nine grounds covered by the 1998 and 2000 Acts, where possible. Once drafted the Bill will be introduced as soon as possible.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	531	A pilot drug court programme commenced in the Dublin District Court in January 2001 for an 18 month period for persons who had committed non-violent drug related offences. Dublin's north inner city was the area selected for the project because of the extent of drug misuse and the availability of treatment in the area.The pilot programme marked a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and was designed as an alternative measure for dealing with less serious and non-violent drug offenders. The project was evaluated by expert consultants at the end of the 18 month period in July 2002. They recommended that the pilot project be extended and the catchment area be widened to include the Dublin 7 area for the period of the extended pilot project to focus on the research and development activity necessary to roll-out the drug court more widely, while continuing and expanding the current pilot to further test and refine the emerging model and to address difficulties which had been identified.I welcomed the recommendations contained in the report and I supported the extension of the drug court to the full Dublin 7 catchment area. This will allow time for further consideration, in consultation with the relevant Departments and agencies, of how the drug court concept should be further developed and resourced.It is expected that the extension of the catchment area will increase the number of referrals to the drug court. As of 31 August 2003, 118 persons have been referred to the drug court for assessment from the Dublin District Court. Eight persons are under various stages of assessment, 41 persons have been returned to the District Court as ineligible for the treatment programme and 69 persons have been assigned treatment plans. Of these, there have been six graduates of the treatment programme. Some 36 persons are participating in the programme and 27 persons have been terminated from the programme.

The estimated cost of paying this award in 2004 is €25.032 million. It should be noted that this figure also covers the cost of payment of the benchmarking award to approximately 1,178 civilian personnel who are paid through the Garda Vote.Approximately 3,200 prison officers are covered by the benchmarking process. The Department of Finance has provided €5.726 million to cover the increased cost of pay and overtime in 2004 arising from this award. This has been provided for all prison service grades and 132 personnel attached to the head office of the Irish Prison Service and to the prison psychology, education and work and training co-ordination services. It is not possible, in the time available, to break down this amount between prison officers and administration personnel.The number of staff in my Department and the bodies within its aegis covered by the benchmarking agreement, other than Garda Síochána and Prison Service staff which are detailed above, are set out in the following tabular statement. The projected benchmarking costs are also detailed.

The visa applications in question relate to their two children who wish to join them in the State. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government also decided that the general policy of allowing such parents to be joined in the State by other family members would no longer apply. Accordingly, the immigration division of my Department does not generally approve visas in respect of such visa applications.

Considerable progress has already been made in this area and I am informed that further work is under way at present. A number of areas including those referred to by the Deputy are under active consideration in this regard.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The Department's records indicate that about 5,000 letters were received from Members of the Oireachtas since the beginning of June 2002. All of these have received an initial reply. The phrasing of the these initial replies will have been determined by their subject matter and it is not possible to say how many of them would have stated "the matter is receiving attention" without examining about 5,000 individual replies.Some of the matters raised are dealt with by phone and others will have received interim replies. In other cases, events may have overtaken the correspondence with formal replies having been deemed unnecessary, but the records may not have been updated. The records indicate that about 2,500 have received a final reply to date.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The person concerned applied for asylum in the State on 1 June 2000. He was refused asylum on 31 October 2001 and also failed in an appeal against that decision. He was notified accordingly on 24 April 2002 and of a proposal to deport him. He made representations  in this regard on 17 May 2002 under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999. Of relevance in the context of those representations is the fact that he is the parent of an Irish born child.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date, of which there are a large number, including the case of the person concerned. He will not be receiving a letter granting permission to remain solely on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child.Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction, the issue of his application for permission to remain on the basis of the Irish born child will be considered in the context of the proposal to deport him. If, in the light of his representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, it is decided not to make a deportation order he will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Given the large number of such cases on hand I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be examined.

The following bodies are wholly staffed by employees of my Department and consequently are covered by the benchmarking agreement: Comhar; Designated Area Appeals Advisory Board; Fire Services Council; Private Residential Tenancies Board; and the Rent Tribunal.Public servants employed by the following bodies under the aegis of my Department are also covered by the benchmarking agreement: An Bord Pleanála; An Chomhairle Leabharlanna; Dublin Docklands Development Authority; Environmental Protection Agency; Heritage Council Housing Finance Agency; Irish Water Safety Association; Local Government Computer Services Board; Local Government Management Services Board; National Building Agency; and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.The following bodies under the aegis of my Department do not directly employ public servants and, as such, the question of benchmarking payments do not arise: Building Regulations Advisory Body and Temple Bar Renewal Limited. It will be possible to provide a firm estimate of the costs of benchmarking for my Department only when the estimates process has been completed and agreement on benchmarking for staff employed in the industrial grades in the civil service has been concluded.

The framework for the operation of the schemes is laid down in statutory regulations and, as far as practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities.Local authorities were notified of their allocations for the payment of disabled person's and essential repairs grants on 5 June 2003. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the disabled persons grant scheme in their areas from within the combined allocation provided. It is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the remaining one third from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.

The restrictions apply, in the main, to the CIE group bus services in the main urban centres at peak times in recognition of the pressure on the bus transport system from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.Special unrestricted travel pass arrangements apply to people with learning disabilities, those attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. The operation of the free travel scheme in this respect and generally is, however, kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements where circumstances allow.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	560	Under the free travel scheme a person aged 66 or over who is married or co-habiting is entitled to a free travel pass which allows a spouse or partner to accompany him or her free of charge when travelling on public transport services. The Department has now amended its free travel scheme guidelines to extend the same benefits to same-sex co-habiting couples in compliance with the Equal Status Act 2000. It is not clear how many people will become eligible for free travel as a result of this amendment. The Department is now examining its other non-statutory schemes to ensure that they are fully in compliance with the Equal Status Act 2000.
