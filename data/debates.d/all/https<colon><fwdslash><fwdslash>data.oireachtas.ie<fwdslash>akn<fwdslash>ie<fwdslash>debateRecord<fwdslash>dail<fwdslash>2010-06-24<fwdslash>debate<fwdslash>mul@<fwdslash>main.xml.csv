#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The Select Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has completed its consideration of Votes 24 and 27 for the year ending 31 December 2010.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32 and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of local and national importance, namely, the determination by the Minister for Health and Children to close Loughloe House, Athlone, County Westmeath, with the initial reason being the findings of the Health Information and Quality Authority report which was interpreted to justify closure.  Despite these findings being negatived by a positive follow-up report, the home which at the time of the first announcement of its closure accommodated 26 patients, three of whom have died since the announcement, still faces closure which is a blow to the residents.  It overlooks the improved standards which include significant increases in the level of hygiene, timely and  unrushed care and a homely atmosphere.  It leads one to the assumption that once the HSE decides for what are blatant cost cutting motives to cut a facility, nothing will change.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	9	We must have order in the House.  I ask Deputy Bannon to resume his seat.  I call Deputy Feighan.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	10	There is enough going on in this House without this carry on.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of national importance, namely, the current interpretation and implementation by the Government of the EU water directive which is undermining the success of applications for planning permissions for one-off sites in certain parts of the country, especially in County Leitrim where 90% of applications will fail to get planning due to the Government's absurd interpretation of this directive.  Given the lack of flexibility on behalf of the Department, I went to Brussels with county councillors from County Leitrim and Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP, where we met the Commissioner who believes the Department's interpretation is causing this problem.  We would want to put our own house in order before we blame Brussels.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 32.

The Minister has signalled an investigation into the Department and he has also indicated the launch of the further investigation into banking.  Will the role of the respective Ministers be included——

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Deputy is out of order.  I cannot allow such a debate on the Order of Business.  I have no difficulty with the Deputy making the point at the appropriate time but not now.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The Minister was willing to clarify it.  It is a reasonable question.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	28	It is not.  Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 7 agreed to?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	29	It is not agreed.  This is an important Bill and we are aware of its implications.  This is another incidence of the Government Chief Whip proposing a guillotine towards the closing stages of a Dáil session.  While I do not want to unduly delay the House by calling a vote, I want to give him a warning that if, for the remaining period of this session, the Government continually makes guillotine proposals, they will be strenuously objected to.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	30	We have had a number of proposals throughout this week to guillotine legislation where it has been perfectly clear that guillotines were not necessary, as the Bills were dealt with in the House in the normal way.  This indicates an incompetent handling of Dáil business by the Government.  A guillotine should be used sparingly.  Generally, it is used to process legislation quickly where there is some urgency or an emergency and it must get through in a quick time or it might be used by government in circumstances where the Opposition was holding up legislation or being obstructive in some way.  None of the legislation to which guillotines are being applied has been subject to a lack of co-operation by the Opposition.  There is absolutely no need for a guillotine on this legislation.  The Labour Party understands why it is necessary to have this Bill in place.  We support the EU stabilisation agreement and there is no need whatever to have the legislation guillotined in the way the Government proposes.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I have to object not only to the imposition of a guillotine in regard to this Bill, but I also oppose the Bill entirely.  A hugely significant measure is contained within the Bill, yet it is being forced through the House.  It will have implications for people across Europe and not only in Ireland.  If we look at what has been said about the measures involved, we can take the Greek situation.  It is not about the ordinary citizens of Greece.  They are being held to pay for the bailout of those who were holding Greek Government debt.  This is not the way we believe it should be addressed and we will oppose the legislation.  Our spokesperson will explain the reasons in detail.  We will neither endorse the approach contained in it nor the guillotine being sought.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I thank Deputies Kenny and Gilmore for the constructive approach they have taken to this legislation.  There has been a substantial public debate on it and, with regard to Committee Stage, there is not great scope for the House to amend it because the legislation is international in character.  I take on board Deputy Gilmore's comment that his party proposes to take a constructive approach to this legislation and, therefore, it should be possible to deal with it today.  I appreciate the general concerns but the fact remains this is urgent legislation from the point of view of the country.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I would like to ask four questions.  First, with regard to the codes of practice for the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, there is a great deal of comment in today's national newspapers about the relationship between property developers and the agency.  As I understand it, it was promised that the codes of practice for NAMA would be published and these would show the interaction between the agency and developers.  Why have they not been published?  Is there a reason for the continued secrecy of the Department of Finance?Second, I refer the extension of the bank guarantee.  It was designed to run until the end of September.  The Dáil will rise on 8 July and it is due to return on an unspecified date in September.  Given the scale of what is involved in the guarantee, the consequences for the taxpayer and the need for the Dáil to have an opportunity to debate the issue, is it intended to have a debate before the House rises for the summer recess or before the guarantee is extended at the end of September?  Given the Minister for Justice and Law Reform stated that it is important that a report be produced on the €200,000 stolen from a bank recently, we need a report on the biggest inside job ever, which was the €22 billion put into Anglo Irish Bank.  Is it intended to introduce legislation to extend the guarantee for Anglo Irish Bank?Third, the Minister said during the debate on NAMA last September that legislation would be introduced to deal with bank resolution issues to ensure the orderly wind up of banks.  We have not seen that legislation.  When is it expected that it will be produced?Fourth, there is serious concern about the national vetting bureau Bill.  Reports indicate that the concern of parents all over the country that up to 60% of summer camp staff have not been vetted and with schools closing and young children getting involved in various summer camps, this is a serious matter for parents.  Deputy Enright produced a Bill in this regard a number of years ago.  It is of immediate concern and perhaps the Minister might like to comment on it.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	34	There are no legislative proposals relating to NAMA but the chairman of the agency recently explained that it has begun to engage directly with borrowers and, as the loans are acquired by NAMA, borrowers are being asked to produce business plans, which will set out detailed and credible targets for reducing their debt.  The chairman and chief executive officer of the agency drew attention to the importance of realism in these plans in some recent comments on this matter.  Where possible, NAMA will work constructively with borrowers to try to achieve the full value of the underlying property to ensure the best return for the taxpayer.I am also advised that the agency has informed borrowers whose loans have transferred to it that it will be stringent in terms of any management costs allowed to them as part of their business plan.  The legislation provides that the agency can borrow up to €5 billion in guaranteed borrowing for purposes other than the purchase of loans from institutions.  This could include advances for the work out on properties transferred to NAMA.  The quarterly reports will provide details of all advances made by the agency and each NAMA group entity.  The first quarterly report is due to be submitted to me in the next week and I will arrange for copies to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The board has also committed to the production of an updated business plan, which it will submit to me by 30 June and which I expect to publish soon thereafter.  The business plan is a matter for the board.  However, I have been advised by the chief executive officer that the board, when reviewing the business plan, will take account of the data now available to it arising from the transfer of the first tranche of loans.Deputy Kenny referred to the bank guarantee and legislation.  There are no proposals to introduce legislation on this matter.My Department is also in discussions with the European Commission about the possible extension of the guarantee on deposits until the end of the year.  However, I am advised that these matters can be dealt with through secondary legislation.  If such secondary legislation is required to be submitted to the Houses before they rise, that will be done.There are no proposals to give Anglo Irish Bank a guarantee of a different character from that of any other financial institution.  This has not been raised as an issue.  It is important, in the context of recent comments by the chief executive of the bank, to note that alongside the losses the State will incur on Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, there are substantial gains through the State's investment in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, some of which have already been realised, in addition to the payments on foot of the guarantee itself, and further gains for the State and the taxpayer from the National Asset Management Agency, which is doing a tremendous job in the valuation of assets while taking a realistic approach to the discharge of its responsibilities.  This is something that Deputy Kenny will have to admit was not fairly acknowledged on his side of the House as being possible when the legislation was introduced.

I understand the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, is working on this legislation and it will be published this year.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I must remind the House that we are on the Order of Business and the Minister is primarily representing the Government rather than speaking in his ministerial capacity.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The Deputy is not in order.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	47	——about the fact that he admitted here, under duress, that the lion's share of the moneys being pumped into Anglo Irish Bank will never be seen again and that the reduction in the capital budget over the next three years of about €11 billion represents a loss of 40,000 jobs.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	48	These points can be made later on when the debate commences.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the situation in view of the fact that this party never said that Anglo Irish Bank should be wound down immediately, but that — in the context of sharing some of the consequences — there could be a serious saving for our economy and the protection of thousands of extra jobs.  I understand the Taoiseach must defend his position and set out the programme as it is, but it could be so much stronger if he only realised that his words here some time ago that the Irish taxpayer would not be liable for the consequences of the bank guarantee were incorrect.  The Irish taxpayer will now be liable for the vast majority of that money which, in the words of Mr. Aynsley, will never be seen again.  The future of our young generations has been mortgaged.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Yesterday, I asked the Tánaiste if she could tell the House the date of the budget and she was not able to do so.  Can I ask the Minister to give the House even an indicative date for the 2011 budget?I also asked the Tánaiste about the date of the resumption of the Dáil after the end of the summer recess and she said the Government had not made any decision about when the Dáil would resume.  I listened to the Minister's reply to the question put by Deputy Kenny about the arrangements for dealing with any extension of the bank guarantee, in which he said he did not feel that legislation would be required but that some rolling over may have to be done.  "Rolling over" is the operative term as it describes the Government's relationship with the banks.  He suggested that it might be done by way of secondary legislation.In whatever form it is done, the extension of the bank guarantee is a matter that should be brought before the House before any commitments are made.  This is a major issue.  I do not know whether the Minister is intending to communicate that an item of secondary legislation to extend the bank guarantee will be prepared during the summer recess and that the House will not have an opportunity of debating it until it is all done and dusted.  If the Government is intending to extend the bank guarantee in any way, the proposal should be brought before the House.  Therefore, we need to know the sitting arrangements for the summer.  We now know the House will rise on 8 July.  It appears from what the Minister has said that he does not intend to introduce any proposal on the bank guarantee before 8 July.  We do not know when the House will resume.  The guarantee will run out on 30 September.  We need some clarity on this.On St. Patrick's Day 2009, in an interview with the Financial Times, the Minister promised new legislation to crack down on crony capitalism in Ireland.  He said he would be proposing these measures to the Cabinet the following week.  What has happened to that legislation?The Labour Party has been conducting a review of the various cutbacks that are taking place in all kinds of services, often in ways that do not get newspaper headlines.  There have been cutbacks in medical cards, supplementary welfare allowance, jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance, home help allowance, the home care package and so on.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	52	This would be more appropriate to a parliamentary question.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I should have mentioned the bank resolution legislation to Deputy Kenny.  I did not deal with that.  The Central Bank is to publish a discussion paper on that matter and the Bill will be ready early next year.  It is important legislation.  There is also considerable debate among EU members about bank resolution legislation.  Clearly, reflection on that discussion will be important in the formulation of our own legislation.

The budget will be announced in early December, as is the usual practice——

There will be no additional budget this year; the budget will be in December.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	72	One will be enough.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Questions were asked about the date of resumption of Dáil Éireann after the summer recess and any arrangements that might be required with regard to the guarantee of banking liabilities.  The Government has made no decision on an appropriate date for the resumption of the Dáil, but it will of course make a decision before the Dáil rises.With regard to the bank guarantee, what I said was that I do not anticipate that any legislation will be required.  Discussions with the European Commission are at an advanced stage and if a statutory instrument is required, one will be adopted.  My understanding is that were such a statutory instrument necessary, it would require approval in the Houses and the necessary approval will be sought.  However, that matter has not been finalised with the European Commission at this stage.With regard to the promised legislation on the directors of financial institutions, that matter will be dealt with in the next Central Bank Bill, which will be published later this year.In regard to the other matter, it is important to stress that the Minister of State in question made it clear that he was speaking in a jocose sense.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	74	That is a dangerous practice.

In any event, as Deputy Brian Lenihan is not the Minister for Finance here this morning, I ask the occupant of the Taoiseach's chair if he knows whether the Minister for Finance has set the terms for the external investigation into the Department of Finance and whether those terms will include an examination of the advices received and decisions taken by a succession of Ministers for Finance regarding quite particularly the property bubble and all that led to the serious economic decline that has beset the economy over the past 18 months to two years.  Will the Minister indicate if this investigation will have access to all the advices that were received by the succession of Ministers for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and the current occupant, the Minister himself?  Will the documentation, the advices, be part of a published report resulting from this external investigation?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Many of the matters referred to, for example, in the newspaper report this morning, were contained in budget documentation at the time so the Deputy's own researcher can establish the existence of various warnings through a simple examination of previous budgetary documentation.The documents in question set out warnings published in budgets, which were read by all Members of this House, of an over-dependence on the property market.  Indeed, the Taoiseach's budget in December 2005 warned of the high proportion of economic activity and employment accounted for by construction and implies economic vulnerability to shock.  Those were the words of the Taoiseach in December 2005.The review of the Department of Finance will look at the work of the Department and the advice it gave to Government.  It is very important when risks are identified, as occurred in previous budgets, that these risks are quantified, brought fully into policy decision-making process and their interaction with each other properly assessed.During his meeting with the Committee of Public Accounts on Thursday 6 May 2010, the Secretary General at the Department acknowledged the Department must review its performance as there are significant lessons to be learned.

Could the Minister clarify exactly what he is saying here?  Is he rejecting the notion that advices were given other than we have already been advised of over the past period of time?  As I have already asked, will——

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	89	The Minister promised the House on Committee and Report Stages of the NAMA legislation and indicated his intention to introduce legislation to assist householders who were running into arrears with their mortgages.  Since then in the House we have ascertained that discussions have taken place between the financial institutions and the Minister's Department.  What progress has there been on the production of that legislation which is eagerly awaited by many people throughout this country who have difficulty with arrears of mortgage?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Government recognises that with the rise in unemployment and the fall in house prices there are those with serious mortgage difficulties.  A range of measures has already been put in place which I do not intend to list on the Order of Business.  The Government has taken a large number of steps in this area already.  The Government set up a review group to examine the solutions to the longer term problems.  The group has an independent chair and experts from different areas.  It is due to produce an interim report to the Government before the summer.  If legislation is recommended in that interim report, I can assure the House that this legislation will be enacted promptly.  That legislation does not technically fall within the description of promised legislation for the purposes of the Order of Business because I am still awaiting the proposals.  I understand they will be made before the summer.

I thank him for his extensive reply.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I am pleased to see that the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, is in the House this morning because I wish to raise the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill which the Minister took in the Seanad yesterday.  It is vital that this Bill comes to this House as quickly as possible.  In my own constituency, 30 young people have been brought to hospital because of a drug called Whack.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The Deputy is anticipating the debate when it arises in the House.

The senior clinician in emergency medicine in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital has expressed serious concern about——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	96	As the Deputy rightly said, the Bill is in the Seanad and it is expected in this House shortly.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I wish to raise two points of order with the Ceann Comhairle and ask for his guidance on two matters.  The first is to do with the disallowing of parliamentary questions.  I have written to the Ceann Comhairle on this matter.  A question of mine was disallowed recently although an identical question had been allowed two months previously from another colleague.  I ask for some guidance as to how his office arrives at the decision to disallow questions.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I advise the Deputy he will have to call to my office to discuss it.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I have done that, Sir, and I am awaiting a response.The second matter is more serious.  Yesterday, I received notice at 12.53 p.m. that a parliamentary questions rota had been decided.  However, by the time we received notice of that decision, the deadline for submitting questions for oral answer had passed.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle how this was allowed and how the matter can be resolved.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The Deputy will have to call to my office and we will discuss all those issues.  We always provide a sympathetic ear.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The issue is quite serious.  I have been trying to get some kind of positive Dáil reform for quite some time but it seems to be going the other way.  The rights of Members are being trodden on.  The notice of the change yesterday was given to us after the deadline and now we cannot submit questions.  That is muzzling Members in a big way.I wanted to raise the issue yesterday of 300 children who are——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	106	The Deputy is completely out of order on the Order of Business.  I have dealt with the Deputy's original matter and now he is moving on the agenda.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I am raising a point of order.  I wanted to put down a question yesterday about 300 children who have intellectual disabilities and for whom there are no inspections and no protection.  The Minister told me yesterday that——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Deputy, the Adjournment and Special Notice Questions are some of the many other ways in which to raise matters.  My office is always sympathetic.  If the Deputy submits a matter for the Adjournment it can be considered.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	109	This is a matter of order in the House.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I ask the Deputy to please make contact with my secretary about any misunderstandings that appear to have arisen and we can discuss the matter.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	111	On that same issue, I agree with Deputy Stanton.  I had a parliamentary question asking the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to calculate the information on a matter.  I always understood that a reply to a parliamentary question was always given to the Member first.  However, when the Department collected the information and before I received the reply, it was put up on the departmental website for the media.  That is not acceptable.  We have order in this House or we do not have order.  It is the Ceann Comhairle's job to protect us as Members of the House.  I ask him to protect us.  If I put down a Dáil question, I expect to get the information first.It should not be up on the website first and for me to get it four days later.  The Ceann Comhairle may inform the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that during the summer recess I will prepare 600 questions for it that will keep it busy throughout next winter.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	112	On the privacy Bill, will the Minister, on behalf of the Government, ensure that records kept by religious bodies relating to women kept in Magdalene laundries will be made available?

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	114	This is very relevant.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	115	It may well be relevant, but it is more appropriate to raise it at another time.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	116	No, this relates to legislation.  Women who worked in these laundries — I use this term loosely — are now being refused their old age contributory pension, despite the fact they worked ——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	117	This is a serious matter that would merit a parliamentary question.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	118	No.  I am being very calm about this.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I know, but I would appreciate the Deputy's co-operation.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	120	An amendment to the privacy legislation is the only way that I can see to enable this to happen, because the argument being used is that if the records were released, this would impinge or impugn the privacy of the people whose records are held.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	121	We will inquire whether there is legislation that would be relevant to this inquiry.  Is there legislation promised?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	122	This is very relevant.  Will we have an amendment that will ensure these records will be released and will there be an amendment to ensure the records are retained?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Is legislation promised in this area?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	124	The Government shares the concerns of Deputy Lynch in this regard.  However, the privacy Bill to which she referred does not include this type of matter within its scope.  The Bill proposes the amendment of the civil law relating to privacy and would not apply to this area.  The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and other Ministers met with various groups representing survivors of residential institutions on 15 April and aspects of this specific issue were raised.  The Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, stated that the Departments and Government agencies would be willing to help with further inquiries relating to those persons sent to Magdalene laundries, including, where available, access to files to the greatest extent possible.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	125	If the privacy legislation is not the legislation to deal with the issue, is it intended to introduce legislation to ensure access will happen?  In light of the Taoiseach's statement, is there a promise to introduce additional legislation.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I suggest the Deputy should pursue the matter by way of a parliamentary question.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I would like an answer.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	128	This is a serious issue about which the Deputy feels strongly.  She should submit a parliamentary question on it.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	129	The Ceann Comhairle made a ruling some months ago which I took very seriously.  He said that we could ask about anything promised inside or outside the House.  If the privacy legislation does not deal with the situation I have raised, additional legislation is clearly needed.  The Taoiseach said he will do whatever is necessary.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Yes, but this debate is broadening out the issue.  We do not have promised legislation, so the Deputy should submit a parliamentary question.

Will the Minister for Finance waive the fee for applications from survivors?My second question relates to debate in the House.  A European Council meeting was held last week at which some important decisions regarding the Europe 2020 strategy were made.  The Government has signed off on this and it will now be the framework on which the European Union and Ireland will develop economically over the next 20 years.  It is normal practice that following the Council meetings, we have a debate on the issue in the House on the following Wednesday, which was yesterday.  No debate has taken place and the Taoiseach did not come to the House to discuss the issue either before he went to the meeting to sign off on the matter or afterwards.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The draft legislation before the House will enable Ireland to join with the other euro area member states in the implementation of the European financial stability facility.  The facility is a contingent €440 billion financial support instrument that will be able to provide loans to euro area member states that are unable to access capital markets due to exceptional circumstances beyond their control.  Ireland's key obligation under the facility will be to provide guarantees up to a ceiling of just over €7 billion, if needed, for any funds raised by the facility to provide loans to such euro area member states.The Bill is a logical consequence of the steps that the European Union and the IMF took in response to the recent Greek funding difficulties.  In that case, the euro area loan facility was established to provide loans of up to €80 billion to Greece over a three-year period.  In conjunction with this, the IMF agreed to provide a maximum of a further €30 billion, making a total of €110 billion available for lending to Greece.  I remind the House that Ireland's share is of the order of €1.5 billion and legislation was enacted last month giving effect to our participation.  The measures put in place ensure that Greece will not need to rely on the sovereign debt markets for the next three years, thus giving it the necessary breathing space to rectify its public finances, while at the same time meeting the policy conditionality attached to the loan facility.  However, at the time it also was recognised that developing and implementing bespoke instruments each time a member state faced difficulties is not a sustainable or prudent approach.  In light of this, it was decided that the EU needed to develop and adopt a comprehensive package of measures that would be of sufficient magnitude to address future potential needs.  On 9 May last, ECOFIN adopted a package of measures, including an IMF contribution, that will provide up to €750 billion in financial support to euro area member states, if required.There are three distinct elements in this package.  The first is the establishment of the European financial stabilisation mechanism, under which up to €60 billion may be borrowed by the European Commission and loaned to member states, subject to strict conditions on budgetary consolidation.  The Council regulation establishing the stabilisation mechanism was adopted by the Council on 10 May 2010.  The stabilisation will be the instrument of first resort should a euro area member state seek assistance.  The second element is the €440 billion European financial stability facility, which is the subject of the Bill before the House.  It will be governed by the intergovernmental framework agreement agreed between the euro area member states and the special purpose vehicle company that will be used to implement the facility.  While the facility is independent of the EU budget, the European Commission will play a key role in its operation.  There is also provision for important functions to be carried out by the EIB and the ECB.  The framework agreement, which I signed on behalf of Ireland on 10 June, subject to the enactment of the Bill before the House, is included in the Schedule to the Bill.The third element is the assistance that the IMF can provide to member states under its existing stand-by arrangements.  It is estimated that this amounts to an aggregate of €250 billion.  The IMF has stated that upon request in individual country cases, it is ready to provide financial assistance to its European members in conjunction with the new European financial stabilisation mechanism and the European financial stability facility.  This would be on a similar basis to the assistance that the IMF has agreed to provide to Greece in conjunction with the euro area loan facility.  Consequently, in overall terms, an aggregate amount to the value of approximately €750 billion is now being put in place to provide support for euro area member states, if needed.The direct financial implications of the Bill relate to the subscription of capital for the European financial stability facility company that will operate the facility.  The State has already committed to contribute its 1.59% share of the currently issued share capital of €31,000, that is, approximately €490.  In addition to the issued share capital, there is an unissued but authorised share capital of €30 million.  Calling up further capital from the authorised share capital requires a unanimous decision by the board of directors and each shareholder is represented by a director.  The provisions relating to this and other matters are all set out in the company's articles of association, which have been laid before the Oireachtas.  If the entire authorised share capital is called up, then Ireland's share would be just under €478,000.  However, this will be reduced slightly following the accession of Estonia to the euro next January.The key obligation of the State under the framework agreement is to provide guarantees to the European financial stability facility company to enable it to raise money to provide loans to euro area member states.  It is only if a guarantee is called that the State will be obliged to fund its share of the guarantee in question.  Therefore, apart from a small amount of paid-up capital, no money is being called upon.  The contribution key, which dictates how much of each funding instrument the State will guarantee, will vary in each case and I will outline the reasons for this when I run through the articles of the framework agreement.  Under the agreement, Ireland's guarantee ceiling is just over €7 billion.  In the highly unlikely event that a guarantee is called, this will not mean that Ireland will never see its money again.  The European financial stability facility company remains liable for funds paid under any guarantee and it will endeavour to secure repayment of any underlying loan in default with a view to returning such funds to guarantors as soon as possible.  In such an event, it is likely that a lengthy period would elapse before losses, if any, could be quantified.The purpose of the Bill is to permit Ireland to work together with its fellow euro area member states to ensure the overall financial stability of the euro area.  The Bill will allow Ireland to issue guarantees in accordance with the European financial stability facility framework agreement and provide for payments to be made from the Central Fund in respect of any obligations arising under the agreement, subject to a maximum ceiling of €7.5 billion.  The Bill is a very straightforward item of legislation because member states' obligations are spelt out in detail in the framework agreement, which is scheduled to the Bill.  After I have explained each of the sections of the Bill, I will explain the key articles of the framework agreement.Section 1 defines the company that will implement the instrument on behalf of the euro area member states and the European financial stability facility framework agreement.  Section 2 provides that the Minister for Finance may issue guarantees on behalf of the State for the purposes of the framework agreement.  Section 3 provides that money may be paid from the Central Fund to meet the obligations of the State arising from the framework agreement, up to a maximum sum of €7.5 billion.  There is an obligation to subscribe to the capital and other costs of the company and additional obligations could arise if a guarantee is called.  Section 4 provides that any money received by the State is to be paid into the Central Fund.Section 5 deals with the reporting obligations.  The Minister must ensure that a report is laid before Dáil Éireann as soon as is practicable after 31 December 2010 and every six months thereafter.  There is provision for more frequent reporting from time to time, if considered necessary.  The report must include information on outstanding guarantees, moneys advanced by the State and money that has been repaid to the State under the framework agreement.  Section 6 amends the reporting requirements of the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010.  This amendment to the earlier legislation for the assistance to Greece takes on board the views expressed during the passage of the legislation for more frequent reporting.  The amendment also makes the reporting requirements consistent with the reporting requirements of this Bill.  Section 7 is a standard section on the expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill and section 8 sets out the Short Title.The Schedule to the Bill contains the European financial stability facility framework agreement.  The agreement begins by stipulating the parties to the agreement.  These consist of the euro area member states and the European financial stability facility company.  This is followed by a preamble, which outlines the origins of the facility and explains its purpose.  As the agreement is a lengthy and detailed document, I wish to highlight some of the key points.Article 1 of the agreement covers the entry into force provisions for the facility.  Essentially, the obligation to issue guarantees becomes operational when member states comprising 90% of the guarantee commitments have submitted their commitment confirmations.  Article 2 covers the granting of loans, funding instruments, the issuance of guarantees and generally sets out how the facility will operate. It provides that a euro area member state seeking financial assistance must agree a memorandum of understanding with the European Commission in liaison with the IMF and the European Central Bank that sets out the budgetary and economic policy conditions with which the borrower must comply in order to receive financial assistance.  In addition, detailed terms and conditions will be set out in a loan facility agreement between the company and the member state in question, subject to the approval of all guarantors.  Article 2 also provides that the company will be responsible for raising the money it requires to advance the loans to borrowers and establishing the terms on which it issues or enters into funding instruments.  In addition, the interest rate to be charged to a borrower will cover the company's cost of funding, plus a margin to provide remuneration to the guarantors.  Guarantors will be required to issue irrevocable and unconditional guarantees in respect of funding instruments issued or entered into under the agreement.  The amount of each member state's guarantee is based on its contribution key to the capital of the ECB, multiplied by 120% of the value of the principal, interest and any other amounts due under a particular funding instrument.  Each guarantor's total potential exposure is limited, as set out in Annexe 1, to its share of ECB capital among the existing 16 euro area member states.  In Ireland's case, the limit is €7.002 billion.  Finally, article 2 provides that the issuing of guarantees is limited to funding instruments related to loan facility agreements entered into on or before 30 June 2013.  It is worth noting, however, that individual loan tranches may be issued after that date.Article 3 covers the preparation and authorisation of loan disbursements.  The strong conditionality of any country programme is emphasised by the requirement that the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, must present a report to the euro group on the compliance of the borrower with the terms and conditions of the memorandum of understanding before each disbursement of a loan, apart from the initial disbursement. The guarantors will evaluate the report and unanimously decide whether to permit the disbursement.Article 4 covers the issuance of or entry into force of funding instruments.  In particular, the company is required to fund the loans it makes by the issuance of or entry into funding instruments on a matched-funding basis, if market conditions permit it.  It also requires the payment dates for loans to be 14 business days before scheduled payment dates for funding instruments.  If matched funding is not possible, then the company may, with the unanimous approval of the guarantors pursue a diversified funding strategy.  There is provision in this regard for the company to delegate the management of it to one or more debt management agencies of euro area member states or to other institutions.Article 5 provides for credit enhancement, liquidity and treasury matters.  Credit enhancement is seen as an extremely important matter because such measures are designed to help secure the highest possible ratings from the credit rating agencies with obvious benefits for the rates at which the company can raise funding.  The first element of credit enhancement is that each guarantee issued by a member state will be for 120% of its actual share of the amount being guaranteed.  That will be of great comfort to holders of funding instruments issued by the company because it builds in redundancy and allows for the extremely difficult to imagine scenario that one of the guarantors fails to honour a call on a guarantee.The second element is that the money raised by the company from the 50 basis point service fees and from the upfront payment of the NPV of the margin of each loan it issues, will be held in a cash reserve to form a cash buffer.  Should the company ever issue any loans, the cash reserve will quickly reach a substantial size thereby boosting the resources of the company.  The cash reserve is there to cover shortfalls in payment to holders of funding instruments and it will only be distributed back to guarantors when the company has fulfilled its purpose and been dissolved.  The cash reserve must be invested in high quality liquid debt instruments.  The company will, in the event of a delay or failure to pay by a borrower, first make a demand on the guarantee from each guarantor.  If that does not cover the due payment on the funding instrument, then the cash reserve can be used.Article 6 covers claims under a guarantee.  If the company does not receive a scheduled payment under a loan it will call in the guarantees from the relevant guarantors.  It will also, if necessary, draw on the cash reserve.  Once a guarantee has been paid, the company is liable to reimburse each guarantor subject to the extent of the funds actually received from the underlying borrowers in respect of the relevant loans.Article 7 covers the contribution between guarantors.  If a guarantee is called to meet a scheduled payment and, due to the non-payment by one or more of the other guarantors, a guarantor ends up paying more than its required proportion, that is, its share of the guarantee in question before it is increased to 120%, then, after three business days, that guarantor is entitled to an indemnity from each of the other guarantors for the excess it has paid plus interest at the rate of one month EURIBOR plus 500 basis points.Article 8 deals with calculations and adjustments of the guarantees.  I have already explained that a prospective borrower can make a request to be excused from having to provide further guarantees.  If that is accepted unanimously, it becomes a stepping-out guarantor and the contribution key in Annexe 2 for the remaining guarantors will be adjusted accordingly.  For example, the article specifically provides that Greece is to be treated as a stepping-out guarantor from the start.  As a consequence, Ireland's contribution rate to guarantees of 1.59% in Annexe 2 as it stands will increase to 1.64%.  On that basis, under the agreement, Ireland's exposure in respect of its overall guarantees remains at just over €7 billion.Article 9 outlines the procedures to be followed by the company if it becomes aware of any breaches of conditions by a borrower or the need for any amendments of a loan facility agreement.  Article 10 deals with the company, inter-guarantor decisions, directors and governance.  It provides that each shareholder, that is each euro area member state, is entitled to be represented by a director, specifically its representative on the eurogroup working group which typically is the relevant economic and financial committee, EFC, member.  Each director's voting weight will correspond to the number of shares held by his country.  The article identifies what decisions guarantors must take on a unanimous basis.  These include decisions on the granting of loan facility agreements, the disbursement of loans, various modifications of loan facility agreements, stepping-out guarantors, significant changes to the credit enhancement structure and the funding strategy of each EFSF programme or any increase in the aggregate amount of guarantees that might be issued under the framework agreement.  Corporate matters of the company that require unanimity include the call-up of capital, the employment of the CEO, approving the accounts and any changes to the company's articles of association, a copy of which has been laid before the House.I draw Deputies' attention to the fact that the definition of the framework agreement includes amendments to it.  That has been included for the very good reason that there will be fairly technical amendments to the agreement from time to lime and it would be a gross misuse of resources to have to prepare amending legislation each time.  For instance, the definition would accommodate the accession of Estonia to the euro and the consequential amendments that will have to be made to the agreement under Article 13(7).  The most significant change that can be made to the agreement would be an increase in the overall ceiling of €440 billion.  Under section 3, the maximum amount that the Central Fund can pay out is €7.5 billion.  I am asking for some leeway over the current maximum exposure to allow for an emergency increase in the agreement's ceiling of €440 billion, potentially when the House is not sitting.  The leeway could permit agreement to an increase of approximately €28 billion on a euro-wide basis over the current €440 billion ceiling without requiring further legislative amendment.  That is an appropriate balance.  Any increase above that level will require an amendment to our legislation before we could agree to it.Article 11 deals with the duration and the liquidation of the company.  The company will remain in existence until 30 June 2013 as a minimum and it will be liquidated as soon as the loans advanced by it have been repaid and all its liabilities to holders of its funding instruments have been discharged.  If no loan facility agreements are in place on or before 30 June 2013, then the company will be dissolved immediately.  On its liquidation, any liabilities, if there are any, may be divided among the shareholders and any assets, after the cash reserve has been distributed, will be distributed to shareholders.Article 12 covers the appointment of the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank to fulfil various financial functions and Article 13 covers the administrative provisions.  These include the use of resources, reporting, the transfer and disposal of shares and amendment of the agreement in the event of the accession of a new member state to theeuro.Annexe 1 to the agreement sets out the list of guarantor member states and their respective guarantee commitments and Annexe 2 sets out the contribution key for each member state.  As I said at the outset, the European financial stability facility is an essential contingency measure.  As Deputies are aware, other broad-ranging measures are also being considered at EU level with a view, inter alia, to improving the economic governance of the euro area and the related arrangements for budgetary surveillance.  I am participating in these discussions as a member of the task force established by President Van Rompuy.  I would like to reassure the House that notwithstanding what has been implied in some media reports, Ireland has nothing to fear and everything to gain from this important process which is likely, if anything, to enhance the role of national parliaments in these matters.In the difficult times we have been experiencing, our membership of the euro has been and continues to be of critical importance to the economy.  It is therefore incumbent upon us to play our part in defending the currency, not only because of the principles of solidarity and responsibility that came with our membership of the euro, but because ensuring the ongoing financial stability of the euro-area is vital to our economic recovery and future success.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  I have outlined the full implications of the legislation before the House including the possible financial implications.  This is an important piece of legislation for us and our European partners.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	159	Fine Gael supports the Bill.  I wish to address a number of issues relating to the Bill and the broader European measures.  In his speech the Minister has provided technical details of the content of the Bill.  Perhaps he will be able to clarify a number of points.  First, he indicated that the level of the guarantee would be up to 120% of our requirement in terms of the schedule, which was €7 billion.  A total of 120% of that would be approximately €8.4 billion yet section 3 specifies the maximum amount we can contribute as €7.5 billion.  Is it technically possible that based on the €7 billion we are required to provide under the guarantee that we could have to provide up to €8.4 billion in spite of the fact that the maximum amount of contribution specified in section 3 is €7.5 billion?  I ask the Minister to clarify that point.A number of issues need to be addressed in the Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has reduced the frequency of reporting under the euro area loan facility agreement from a year to six months.  The European financial stability facility company must report on a quarterly basis to the European Commission.  We tabled amendments to require the Minister to lay the reports before the House within two weeks of receiving them from the various European bodies.It is important to know the level of funding required.  I assume the €7.5 billion to which the Minister referred contributes to the €478,000 that we could potentially put into the company by way of additional share capital, plus the running costs.  Will the Minster clarify this?  The expenditure by way of capital and expenses on foot of the agreement should be reported on annually.The Euro Area Loan Facility Act contains a mechanism whereby no government would be out of pocket, specifically in respect of Greece.  If the cost of funding in respect of borrowing on the part of a member state is higher than what a member state receives from Greece, there is a mechanism whereby that member state will be recompensed.  As the Minister is well aware, our bond yields are well in excess of those of Germany, perhaps by 250 basis points.  If it arises that Ireland is required to give a guarantee along with other member states, that will certainly affect the cost of borrowing from the international markets.  Unlike countries that may not be as affected, will we be compensated in any way through the mechanism for the additional cost to the Irish taxpayer?The European Financial Stability Facility Bill 2010 is to provide stability in the Union.  When the package was launched in early May, bond yields reduced considerably.  They reduced from 6% to 4.5% in the Irish case, and subsequently rose to 5.2%.  The bond markets are worried that the scale of the problem could be bigger than the actual package.  Will the Minister address this?  The bond markets fear that European policy is very much being driven by fiscal austerity measures when what is required is a proper growth strategy.The Europe 2020 document has effectively been agreed by the member states.  Ireland will have to produce its own plan in that regard but I do not believe one can bridge a budget deficit without a credible growth strategy.  In Ireland, this has been missing.  It is a point of discussion with the Minister that takes into account the fundamentals in terms of the economy, low inflation, low interest rates and cost competitiveness.  I am not in any way disagreeing with that but various reports state our unemployment level will remain consistently high, at 13.1% in 2010, 12.2% in 2011 and 11% in 2012.  In 2014, there will be an unemployment rate of 10%.  We do not want purely jobless growth.The Union has identified that a growth strategy is critical.  It has been lacking here and this has not been addressed.  There are 440,000 people on the live register as we speak.  The Minister will be aware that many people who became unemployed in the past year were on jobseeker's benefit and are now to receive the jobseeker's allowance and the amount they are receiving is decreasing significantly.  There will be long-term unemployment, which causes major problems.The Europe 2020 document refers specifically to people in the younger age bracket.  The aim is to raise to 75% the employment rate for women and men aged 20 to 64, including through greater participation of young people, older workers and low-skilled workers, and the better integration of legal migrants.Our live register figures would be significantly higher but for emigration.  It has effectively lowered the real unemployment level and cannot be overlooked.  With regard to the European context, the IMF is stating Asia has a tremendous growth pattern and that even the United States has a stronger growth pattern than Ireland.  The latter has a growth strategy.I said in the Chamber approximately 18 months ago that I always felt there should be a contingency fund put aside every year in the budget for a rainy day.  Professor Honohan mentioned this also.  I refer to an equivalent of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  If we had this, we would have been able to have a fiscal stimulus when the financial crisis arose at the end of 2007.  However, the overdraft was at its limit and the Minister did not have that luxury.  We needed to have it and, as with banks, we need mechanisms in place that make contingency funds available.The Minister is constantly referring to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It was set up for pensions but I am talking about a fund that would be used specifically to create a fiscal stimulus if the country encountered a financial crisis.  The Government has cut the capital budget, which has major consequences.  The cuts over recent years have probably cost 40,000 jobs.The Taoiseach referred last night to the capital budget and the jobs it creates.  Many of the capital projects of the past were not geared towards employment creation.  Fine Gael feels strongly that the capital budget should be left unchecked.  It has always advocated that there should be proper cost-benefit analysis.  Many of the plans under the national development plan were never subject to rigorous cost-benefit analysis before they were implemented.  Doing so is fundamental.I note in media reports today that the Department of Finance stated it highlighted the existence of the property bubble in 2005 to the Ministers in charge, including the current Taoiseach.  The tax incentive schemes were continued until July 2008, two and a half years later.  This needs to be addressed.The only person we have not heard from on this issue is the Taoiseach.  We have had this discussion many times.  All the eminent and excellent reports issued to date imply the key missing ingredient was discussion with the relevant Minister when issues arose.  It is critical that the terms of reference for the external review of the Department of Finance be made public and that they include the policy decisions made by Ministers at given times.  The external review is to cover the period from 2000.  To ensure public confidence and accountability, it is critical that the terms of reference refer in absolute terms to the Ministers for Finance in office during the period covered by the review.  There were three, including the current Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I note that the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, is willing.  The two previous Ministers, namely the Taoiseach and the former Deputy Charlie McCreevy, would be available to give evidence in public.  People want accountability and transparency.  The ESRI and other bodies have stated that they all had difficulties in looking at issues at a moment in time.  For the sake of completeness, we need to hear from the Taoiseach as well.If this package is never called in, we will have succeeded.  If it is called in, then there are major issues.  A number of questions must be asked.  Will the austerity measures be complied with by the countries that need to comply with them and will there be a situation where one size fits all?  My worry would be that large economies such as Germany benefit significantly from the euro.  Germany is very much an export orientated country.  In the natural environment without a common currency the deutsche mark would have appreciated and this would have enabled other countries to improve their competitiveness.  However, Germany is extremely strong in terms of exports and it needs to boost domestic consumption.  If it boosts domestic consumption, that would benefit the rest of the EU.It is critical when looking at Europe as a whole that we have financial measures in place that enable all countries to function, not necessarily the larger countries but countries such as ourselves as well.  We are an export nation and we must get to a situation where we can export into Europe in a competitive way.  Germany has a major comparative advantage because it is exporting to such an enormous degree and it is gaining such an enormous advantage from a common currency.  The key feature is domestic consumption in Germany and if we can find a mechanism by which that can rise, that would be a significant element.The critical issue, which I mentioned earlier, is the growth strategy and the Europe 2020 document.  I want to know when the Minister will put forward Ireland's proposals for targets.  There is a national programme to be put forward to that effect to the EU as well.  Targets must be set.  How can we ensure that people come off the live register in a constructive way?We must look at, while not necessarily commenting on, the British emergency budget yesterday in which there was a point of principle, which was that the private sector will be key to economic recovery.  The British Government reduced its corporation tax rate, which has implications for us as a country.  In the wider context, it will be the SME sector that will bring about growth.We discussed NAMA on the Order of Business, but it would be critical in terms of the role of Mr. John Trethowan in the SME sector to get credit flowing so that there would be sectoral limits of credit to flow to various sectoral areas so that we identify areas where we are strong and very much export driven.  We have a situation whereby we are providing credit flowing to the SME sector with an element being policy driven.  One must have something here that will enable the SME sector to come out of the situation in which it is.Often this is like a bubble where we speak about matters in abstract terms.  There are businesses around the country which are losing one and two employees.  There are 320,000 SME employers in the country, 155,000 of which employ two or three persons or more.  If each of those could take on an extra person, that would result in 155,000 persons coming off the live register.  These are the straightforward simple questions.In my experience over many years in practice as an accountant — I was a sole trader for many years — cash is king and credit is the key element that puts businesses out of operation.  If they have not cashflow, profitable viable entities will go out of business.  One can have a profitable business that will cease to trade because it has not cashflow.  Equally, one can have an unprofitable business that can continue because it has cashflow.  With the approach in Ireland, we must ensure that credit flows to the SME sector.My party put forward a range of suggestions.  There is a strong case for cutting employers' PRSI.  My party put forward, in our last pre-budget document, that the lower rate should be halved and the upper rate should be reduced considerably, by 2% or 3%, to give a benefit.In Europe, there is a need for fiscal consolidation and structural reform.  I spoke about structural reform in terms of Germany and the other countries.  Greece's economy is heavily reliant on tourism and has a soft underbelly.  There must be ways to facilitate structural reform across Europe to ensure that this guarantee is never called upon.  The way that will arise is if each country deals with its cost base, fiscal measures and growth measures.The other issue I want to address is banking.  The European Union is currently looking into financial stability measures for the banking sector and I understand they will be produced in 2011.  It is critical that there would be consistency between member states in how regulation is enforced.  We are now moving towards very much principles' based regulation, which I welcome.  It must be done in a way to ensure that we can balance it with attracting industry.  It will be to our benefit.  If we have capital ratio crime, it is in the banking sector.  Effectively, it will ensure the security of those banks.  It is something about which I feel strongly and is something we badly need to address in a European context.In looking at it from both a European context and a national context, for this proposal to operate the key features are that it must never be called upon, and that is about Europe dealing with the issues of financial stability, structural reform, the area of banking regulation and the area of a growth strategy.  In terms of Ireland Inc, it is critical that we address all of those issues as well.  In Ireland, the key issue that stands out is the stark levels of unemployment with 440,000 plus on the live register.  That is the issue for us as a country.Banking is being dealt with.  Issues over which we will have concerns are NAMA, the flow of credit and fiscal consolidation.  We have concerns about the cutting of the capital budget.  We have issues with bringing in a property tax on home owners who are under severe pressure at a time when many of them are in negative equity.  There are ways the Minister can make savings in general public spending and these are issues that should be looked at rather than taking the easy option of imposing a property tax on residential homes.  As we well know, its previous incarnation was the residential property tax measure, which did not work and was a nightmare.  The difference in this context is people cannot afford it.  Governments are there to represent people and it is something that must be taken on board.Of the 440,000 people unemployed, many are fast becoming chronically long-term unemployed.  Each Deputy's constituency office is visited by people who have become unemployed, received redundancy payments and gone on jobseeker's benefit only to find that, after 12 months, they must be means tested for jobseeker's allowance.  Since a person's husband or wife might still be working, the allowance is significantly reduced.  This places people in considerable financial difficulties.  They could have a mortgage they are finding difficult to service, yet the Government is discussing the introduction of a property tax that could be applied to them, as they would be still in receipt of income.  I note from reports that the tax might not be applied to the unemployed, but what about a married couple in which only one partner has become unemployed?  The principle of a property tax on residential homes is draconian and unfair.  It is a retrograde step by the Government.  The issue could be addressed in another fashion.In the European context, the concern is that Ireland is moving into a debt crisis.  Our national debt has doubled.  One reason for our bond yields being the second highest in Europe after Portugal's is our debt level.  We have borrowed close to €50 billion in respect of NAMA, an amount that will fall on the taxpayer.  There is a general view that the Government did not move quickly enough to react to the financial crisis when it evolved in 2007.  I remember the then Minister for Finance, the current Taoiseach, telling the House we were in for a soft landing.  He repeated this comment over many months.  According to Dan O'Connor, an eminent economist, our bond yields are so high because of our debt levels and because the Government did not move quickly enough to deal with the budget deficit going out of control, although we still have an element of credibility.  Something should have been done in the December 2007 budget.  Instead, we waited virtually 18 months until April 2009 before measures were introduced to address the financial crisis.Two further measures will impact on the cost of borrowing, namely, the eurozone loan facility in respect of Greece and this Bill.  The former requires €1.5 billion and the latter requires €7.5 billion, amounting to €9 billion in total, nearly 6% of our GDP.  This figure is phenomenal, but still manages to put into context the sheer scale of the money invested in Anglo Irish Bank.  That investment is almost three times larger.  When the bank's board appeared before the Oireachtas finance committee, I asked whether €22 billion had gone down the toilet.  The answer was "Yes".  The €9 billion is an horrendous amount of money.  It is €1 billion more than our annual investment in the Department of Education and Skills and is an exposure for the taxpayer.  We must ensure the European Financial Stability Facility Bill 2010 is never called upon.Europe has identified that we will not bridge our budget deficit without a proper growth strategy.  It is time that the Government recognised this fact also, as it will have implications for the 440,000 people on the live register.  Taking someone off the live register restores his or her dignity and saves the Exchequer approximately €20,000.Ireland is seeking to borrow up to €40 billion from the international markets between now and 2012.  If our bond yields are increasing, the cost to the taxpayer will be greater and the service we can provide will be reduced.  I would like a twin-track approach to reducing the budget deficit.  We must make cuts in expenditure and savings, but we must find ways to boost our revenue from structured taxes like income tax instead of through, for example, a property tax that would place an unfair burden on people.  Let us find mechanisms through which we can have a sustainable and export-driven economy and ensure that people return to work and that our markets are competitive.  Side by side with these must be structural reforms in Europe, since it should not be a case of one size fitting all, given the presence of Germany and other large countries.  We must ensure that our country can export and have a comparative advantage in Europe in that regard.Fine Gael will support the Bill and I look forward to the Minister of State's response to my queries.  We have tabled a number of amendments in respect of reporting requirements, as the Minister for Finance should lay the quarterly reports on the European Financial Stability Facility Bill and the eurozone loan Bill before the House two weeks after receiving them.  We need more details on the arrangements entered into under this legislation and the Greek bailout Bill on behalf of the taxpayer, as €440 billion of the €750 billion involved in the former will come from EU member states.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	162	This Bill is the technical expression of the deal reached by eurozone countries in a bid to avoid the wave of sovereign debt defaults threatening Europe.  Before discussing Europe in general, I wish to reflect on a number of issues pertaining to the Irish situation.  There is an onus on the Minister for Finance and his Department to make a number of statements and to provide information before the recess that would allow us to assess genuinely the Irish position before entering the guarantee's exit period.  According to Fianna Fáil, that €440 billion guarantee would cost the taxpayer nothing, be the cheapest in the world and restore our fortunes.  It will officially expire at the end of September.  The Minister appears to be confident that he can extend it by a further month, if not to the end of the year.Nonetheless, we are in the exit period for the Irish bank guarantee.  What is the debt cliff as we approach the end game in the bank guarantee?  The Government has established the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, with the permission of Europe so that new debt that can be rolled out of the guarantee will be guaranteed by our Government for a period of up to five more years.  I have been continuously requesting information from the Minister and from the Department of Finance in respect of this.  From the Minister's most recent suggestion, some €30 billion of senior debt is coming up for rollover between now and the end of the year.  Earlier answers by the Minister suggest the figure may be as high as €74 billion.  It is wrong that I, as spokesperson on finance for the Labour Party, have not been provided with a definitive answer.  I refer to the mismanagement of the Irish banking crisis, not simply by Fianna Fáil but also because of the lack of appropriate advice from the Department of Finance.  We do not know this because we have not seen the documents.  It may well be that the Department of Finance advised the Minister well but was overridden by the Department of the Taoiseach.  As far as banking and financial information is concerned, we are living in a secret society.  We are prepared to let the international bond markets know our financial position and the senior bankers in the discredited banking institutions seem to know what the position is but the people of Ireland and their elected representatives in the Oireachtas do not have that information.  This is a serious mistake in trying to help the country to exit from the decision by Fianna Fáil to provide a blanket guarantee, including the guarantees to the failed Anglo Irish Bank and the even more failed but smaller Irish Nationwide Building Society.We also have a debt overhang in respect of NAMA.  We have passed the middle part of June.  In discussions on NAMA, we were promised the revised business plan of NAMA would be published and available.  We are approaching the end of June but we do not have a clue what is the revised NAMA business plan, nor do we know if the Minister has a clue.  The indications, in revised answers, were that the revised plan would be made available to the Minister by the end of June and perhaps the mere Parliament of the Irish people would receive it shortly thereafter.  However, we do not know.  This is a core element of the Irish problem.  We have a Government that has chosen to adopt total secrecy.  The advice of Merrill Lynch to the Government has not been published, nor has the stress testing of Irish banks.  This inevitably will be adopted by the eurozone to appease financial markets so they know how good or bad is the sovereign debt of individual banks and individual countries.  That is as inevitable as night follows day yet years after stress testing, which we were told showed everything in the Irish banks was fine and dandy, we do not have a word of information published.I challenge the Minister of Finance to deliver on his promise that he and the Taoiseach will face the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to answer these questions.  He threw out the rhetoric last week to the effect that he was prepared to tell us whatever we wanted to know and was prepared to make documentation available but I am standing here empty-handed and I am as wise now as when he issued these rhetorical promises last week.  These promises are as good as Fianna Fáil's promise at the time of the last election to cut PRSI by 50% and to raise the old age pension to €300 per week.  Promises made by the Minister for Finance last week about the divulging of information about the Irish crisis have not been made good.  I challenge the Minister to put the information in the public domain.NAMA is, in effect, a secret body whose leading figures give interviews and some information from time to time.  We know nothing in detail about the top developers, many of whom are into NAMA for sums between €1 billion and €1.5 billion of debt.  What is going on between NAMA, Treasury Holdings and the principals associated with Treasury Holdings, Mr. Ronan and Mr. Barrett?  It is extremely important the Minister tells us what is going on.  A statement was issued yesterday, which was published in the newspapers this morning, by Treasury Holdings and Real Estate Opportunities, REO, that the losses last year in respect of Irish properties were north of 51%.  However, according to the story, the company requested the Irish Government, through NAMA, to participate in the development of the Chelsea power station site.  According to newspaper reports, this would cost between €5 billion and €6 billion.  When the NAMA Bill was before the House, the borrowing powers of NAMA in financing developers to finish projects was listed as €5 billion.  I do not think the Government is foolish enough to endorse a suggestion that it would finance the building of the enormous Chelsea power station, but we are entitled to know what view the Government is taking.We know that China Real Estate Opportunities, CREO, is moving to Singapore to be closer to its eastern markets.  Can the Minister for Finance and the Government tell us the position of the principals of Treasury Holdings, REO and CREO, who I understand to include Mr. Barrett and Mr. Ronan?  Have they given enforceable personal guarantees to NAMA and the Irish Government in respect of the recovery of the money and advanced via NAMA for distressed loans, most of which arise from the failed Anglo Irish Bank?  It is important for the Minister to return to the Dáil and make a statement because vast amounts of money are riding on the proposals in the newspapers this morning.  We have been told nothing by the Minister for Finance.  It is important that we find out before this day is over.  Through Anglo Irish Bank, we know we are on the hook for at least €1 billion in losses in respect of Quinn Insurance.  Now, the principals in REO want to complete Chelsea power station and the cost will be between €5 billion and €6 billion.  I want a statement on the record as to the position the Minister for Finance is taking on this proposal.  The powers NAMA has are extraordinary, and the powers the Minister for Finance has in respect of the covered institutions and NAMA are extraordinary.  These are very large amounts of money and we are entitled to know the Government's business plan regarding these proposals because, in effect, the Government is a very large, if not the greatest, stakeholder in these various companies.If China Real Estate Opportunities is going to Singapore, I want to know if the Government was consulted about the Singapore listing?  What is the position on the principals in the company?  Are they likely to move to Singapore and go offshore from Ireland?  Have guarantees been given by the principals of the company in respect of the obligations NAMA has taken over from the distresses of their companies in order to put the debt of their companies onto the backs of the Irish taxpayers through NAMA?These are important and fundamental questions, and they must be discussed and responded to by the Department of Finance and by the Minister for Finance.  I expect the Minister to return to the House and to give us answers because what is happening in the context of today's debate is that the European Union and the eurozone are essentially offering a stabilisation fund to the markets, which the Labour Party supports.  The markets are good now, and all of the institutions of the Irish State — the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator — bow down to the markets.  They are offering the markets, collectively and through the eurozone, this burnt offering but it is incumbent on Members of this House to make sure that burnt offering does not mean the Irish people become toast as a consequence of the markets.  The Minister has been less than forthcoming in the statement he made here this morning.It is ironic that the National Treasury Management Agency is based in the Treasury Building, which has a figure either climbing down the side of the building or holding on for dear life climbing up the side of it.  I am not sure which it is but I know the proprietors and the principal people in Treasury Holdings seem to have been able to hold on to their lifestyles.  One of the principals was able to fly off to Morocco in a private jet for a long weekend.  I cannot last remember when a civil servant who took a pension levy or a wage cut was able to jet off to Morocco with friends for a long weekend.  Are these people so important they are not questionable and they are not to be accountable for their actions?  They are clever business people.  They have hit a financial crash.  They will possibly get themselves out of it again but our interest is to ensure that Irish taxpayers' money is recovered in good time and in good order so that we do not have to spend it on banks but on important areas such as schools and hospitals and getting people back to work.  That is the net point.All of us in Ireland and in Europe have a huge vested interest in a sound euro.  It is hard to credit, given the disastrous economic management of Fianna Fáil, but we in Ireland would be much worse off without the euro.  We have only to consider what happened in Iceland and the difficulties it had with such a weak and greatly devalued currency.  The continued solvency of the participating member states in the eurozone is vital to the euro as it is a more all-encompassing way for Europeans, including us in Ireland, to proceed.Economic and monetary union in Europe is a unique economic development which has resulted in significant gains for everybody in the euro area.  There is no federal state or political union among the states.  Instead, sovereign states are sharing their sovereignty for the mutual benefit of the citizens of the states, with effective supranational institutions like the European Commission and the European Central Bank, but uniquely for a union of sovereign states, European Union law has supremacy over national law.  We have this continuous tension in Europe between European sovereignty on the one hand and a group of national states on the other.It is clear that EMU is a work in progress.  The original design of this unique monetary union was not adequate for the long-term survival of the euro and, to be honest, the jury is still out on that.  It could not withstand a foreseeable solvency crisis, even in a relatively small participating state.  Like Ireland, Greece, the country most in the news in that regard, is a very small percentage of the total activity and percentage of the eurozone.A foreseeable problem is that there is a large risk of contagion from one crisis hit state to other participating states perceived by the financial markets as having similar problems.  That remains a problem for us.  The exit strategy from the guarantee scheme is coming up.  We do not know what is the debt overhang.  We have bond rates which are higher than Spain, despite the fact that we have had a much greater level of austerity, yet so far Spain has only committed to future austerity.After the economic and financial crisis of May 2010 we now know that we need a large stabilisation fund as part of EMU because there will not be a federal government with a corresponding financial capacity in Europe for decades to come, if ever.  We cannot let our euro and our economic futures be at the mercy of global financial markets or let anonymous traders have a go and make a quick million bucks without a care or thought for the lives that would be affected as a result of their actions.  This stabilisation fund, in the view of the Labour Party, is a belated but essential piece of the architecture of a sound and permanent euro and economic and monetary union in Europe.Let us be clear.  The purpose of that economic and monetary union from the point of view of the Labour Party, and on that we differ from Fianna Fáil, is not about the prosperity of bankers.  It is about the prosperity of citizens.  Fianna Fáil is focused exclusively on bailing out the bankers and the developers.  That is the reason it is so important that the questions I raised earlier are answered.  Will we get back our money or will we put more money in the way of the developers through NAMA?I hope the measures taken here this morning will be accompanied, in the case of Europe, by a financial transactions tax that would operate at a small level on financial transactions.  In the Irish case, if the Labour Party gets into power, we want to see our money being recovered and a levy on the banks because we know that with the losses accumulated by the banks it will be decades before any bank in Ireland will pay tax.  We want to see a plan from Fianna Fáil — the Minister did not even refer to it — of how the ordinary Irish taxpayer is to recover their money.  Instead, we had Fianna Fáil blithely suggesting yesterday that the ordinary Irish taxpayer is good for another soaking in terms of a range of new taxes while the banks will be left on the side to contribute zero.  It is no wonder citizens are enraged, and rightly so.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I thank Deputy Burton and the Labour Party for sharing time with me.The EU has now set up a special purpose vehicle, SPV, under the European stabilisation mechanism that will provide funding of up to €440 billion to any eurozone state or states in debt trouble.  This SPV is, of course, underwritten by the same eurozone countries that it has been set up to protect.The €440 billion fund will act as a guarantee for sovereign debt issuances by eurozone countries.  Countries will each secure 120% of their share of the loans to secure the highest rating for the debt.  The EU finance Ministers' aim is for ratings companies to assign a triple AAA rating to the facility and whose bonds would be eligible for European Central Bank, ECB, re-financing operations.  The agency will sell bonds, backed by guarantees, and use the moneys it raises to make loans to eurozone states in need.Bizarrely, the debt crisis is being fought with more debt.  I do not subscribe to this legislation because one cannot treat a debt-fuelled over-consumption problem by adding much more debt.  This is an illogical position in which eurozone governments are guaranteeing their own debt before it is even issued.  We are in a position where the ECB is keeping our banks afloat and the eurozone countries are keeping each other afloat through mutual guarantees.  The underlying problem of too much bad debt, however, is still there.It is the significant size of the banking sector in the core European countries and the amount of debt in the peripheral countries that they are holding that is determining who in Europe must be saved and who must make sacrifices.  Since these banks are the recipients of the bailout, their losses have even determined the size of the bailout too.  The Greek bailout did not aim to revive the Greek economy.  Instead, it was to provide a guarantee against a debt default by Greece and other European crisis-hit economies.  It was, therefore, entirely a bailout for holders of Greek Government debt.The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Ollie Rehn, said any loans from the European financial stability facility, EFSF, would impose the kind of austerity budget conditions on recipients that Greece faces as part of a programme for receiving quarterly aid disbursements under the 2 May accord.  The process for providing assistance will be similar to that under the loans-to-Greece package.  The loans are strictly conditional on a programme being agreed to by the country concerned, as well as the EU and the IMF.  The final decision, however, will be taken by the board of directors of the EFSF.  The IMF has become the policeman of the eurozone.  With that decision the only thing that can happen is the strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact to the detriment of smaller countries and the weakest economies.  This is not a mechanism of solidarity; it is one of pressure.  Already other countries, such as Spain and Portugal, are taking measures against working people, driving up unemployment and poverty without providing any way out of this crisis.  Social dumping has become the only instrument of competition in the EU, far from the Europe of solidarity and social cohesion.We must not forget the role of the IMF in Ireland's banking crisis, as highlighted by the two reports published this month.  Professor Patrick Honohan stated in his report that the IMF was not strongly or consistently critical of the underlying dynamics of fiscal policy.  Its oversight failed abysmally and now it is charged with overseeing European financial stability.  In whose interests is this?  It certainly is not in the interest of ordinary people for whom the IMF is recommending cutting wages, welfare and public services.European governments are currently repeating their age-old mistake of cutting spending and raising taxes for low-income earners well before the economy has recovered.  In the US, there is a debate about another stimulus package to ensure the recovery does not prematurely run out of steam, a wise approach.  The Europeans, on the other hand, are choking off the recovery before it has even started.  The premature austerity programmes will ultimately impede debt reduction as nominal growth remains weak.The crisis in the EU is badly affecting European economies and societies.  Policies adopted to cover its costs have lead to harsh austerity measures that have only deepened the recession, encouraged the growth of unemployment and attacked labour and pension rights.Sinn Féin is not anti-EU.  However, it recognises the push for strengthened fiscal union is undermining the peoples of Europe.  This drive for fiscal consolidation has shown a lack of will among European leaders to deliver a social union.  The EU must be more than about the Single Market with a common currency.  We need sustainable policies for growth and stimulus that will benefit the peoples of Europe rather than depress them.  I hope the Minister of State will not try to misrepresent my party's position on this Bill as being anti-EU.Countries that enter into debt to save jobs and stimulate recovery by investment should not be punished.  Taxes that governments rely on to service their debts have plunged and actually led to wider deficits.  If any economy does not grow but tries to pay its large debts, it will turn into a debt-servicing agency which hollows out the productive marrow of society.European finance Ministers have resolved to submit draft budgets for the approval of their counterparts and the European Commission before unveiling them in national parliaments.  Ministers have agreed to impose new financial penalties on governments that flout EU budget rules.  Responding to pressure on the euro following the Greek debt debacle, they also agreed to widen the scope of existing surveillance measures to compel countries with high national debts to reduce them.With the combination of these budgetary oversight mechanisms and the stringent terms and conditions that will be attached to countries that need to draw down from the EFSF, it is clear economic recovery and growth will be stunted by harsh contraction measures that will not stimulate the economy, create employment or deliver people from poverty.Rather than the creation of financial measures that will actually help ailing European economies, the package that has been put together by the Commission and eurozone Ministers is crippling both economically and socially.  We should not be mistaken.  The European Commission will police national budgets and dictate where cuts and savings should be made.  Unless its diktat is followed, countries will not be eligible to draw down certain funding from the EU.  If countries do not follow the diktat, they will be punished at EU level.How can I support this legislation that will undoubtedly and unduly punish and penalise the peoples of Europe?  I agree with the objective of trying to create a collective response to the attack on the euro.  However, this facility is not the best way of achieving this.  A different economic approach is essential.  A stimulus package, like that in the United States, must be at the heart of building our way out of this economic crisis rather than punishing and crippling the poorest in our society.

Equally, I acknowledge and respect the Sinn Féin party adoption of a different position.Deputy O'Donnell rightly recognises this facility will succeed best if it were never used, a view heartfelt across the eurozone.  As the Minister for Finance outlined, this is essentially a contingency or preventive measure.  Across a broad range of areas including financial stability, banking supervision and regulation, economic governance and budgetary surveillance, measures will be taken to ensure, as far as possible, that difficulties such as those experienced in the past two years will not recur.  In an earlier debate I quoted a statement by the EU Council President, Mr. Van Rompuy, on the whole crisis.  I refer to his words from memory, without necessarily fully endorsing them.  Effectively, he stated that the EU and the eurozone had been asleep for seven or eight years and had not seen this problem coming and, therefore, this was the reason for the actions being taken.It is absolutely in Ireland's interest to play a full part in this as members of the eurozone.  I will come back on this matter towards the end of the debate.  There are voices, more outside the House than inside, which question the wisdom of this approach and this must be addressed.I have no wish to do him an injustice but Deputy O'Donnell appeared to be counting the level of guarantees we must provide as money spent.

However, I emphasise that the Minister's speech dealt with the financial implications of the Bill.  Aside from our capital contribution, which is relatively small, money will only be required if a guarantee is called.  Even then, every effort would be made to secure repayments of a so-called guarantee.  Our guarantees should not turn into losses and every effort will be made to ensure that scenario does not arise.

This is to counter for the possibility that some member states which should provide the guarantee may be unable to do so.  The question I am asking is simple.  If one is required to provide 120% of the contribution amount——

Could one potentially have a situation whereby the amount required would be well in excess of the €7.5 billion being provided in Part 1 of section 3?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I will come to that within two minutes.  The Deputy is raising the matter of the cost of funds to Ireland if the guarantee is called.  The framework agreement provides within its structure of fees and expenses for a margin to be charged to borrowers to remunerate guarantors.  It is envisaged that in the event that Ireland or any other member state faced a relatively larger cost of funds to meet guarantees, it would as far as possible, as in the case of the Greek facility, be made good to guarantors.  The decision to issue guarantees is in all cases subject to unanimity among the member states concerned.  These provisions will protect the interests of the taxpayer should the issue arise.Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of whether the 120% requirement would increase the €7 billion exposure.  I admit this is a question I have tried to get my head around as well.  The answer is that it will not increase the €7 billion ceiling because the 120% requirement only relates to each individual funding instrument.  Annexe 1 sets out an aggregate ceiling for all guarantees from each guarantor.  To put it another way, let us suppose there is a loan of €10 billion to country X.  Our guarantee is for €10 billion multiplied by the contribution key, which is derived from multiplying by 0.0164%.  This corresponds to the reference to 1.64% multiplied by 120%.  If the amount guaranteed is €1 million, we guarantee €1.2 million.  However, the sum of all our guarantees is still limited to €7 billion.Deputy O'Donnell also raised the broader issue of the availability of a contingency fund in each year's budget for financial crises.  During the past 30 years I recall budgets, which may well have been introduced by Fine Gael and Labour Party Governments and as part of which there was a contingency fund.  However, I am speaking from memory.

I will come back on the question of the stimulus later.The Deputy also raised the question with regard to the EU 2020 strategy and whether Ireland will be putting forward targets.  Under existing arrangements, Ireland and other member states publish and submit national reform programmes to the EU.  These programmes set out structural aspects of the economy and outline the Government's objectives for various sectors as well as important issues, for example, those related to competitiveness and the labour market.  These programmes specifically take account of the areas which have been identified as priorities under the EU 2020 strategy.I refer to the issues of boosting employment and PRSI.  This matter is regularly raised with the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions.  The Deputy will be aware of the new scheme announced last weekend by the Taoiseach, which gives a PRSI exemption for new employees provided they have been on the live register for more than six months.Deputy Burton raised some large and important issues.  It is fair to say they are not directly related to the Bill but rather to the State's banking guarantee, the NAMA business plan and various other issues.  I have noted the issues but they are too important for me to give a top-of-the-head reply.  They are not directly related to the legislation but I am sure the Deputy will pursue these matters with the Minister for Finance and I will report the matters raised to him.  However, I believe she deserves an authoritative response from him rather than me.

Having given that general caveat, I will comment on some of her remarks.  I am rather tempted to refer to the Battersea power station rather than the Chelsea power station.  While reserving the position of the Minister for Finance on the matter, I would be amazed if we were to become involved as a partner in projects of that type abroad in the context of this discussion.  As was said, it is an unfortunate aspect of the world in which we live that the markets are god.  In a sense, every European country has found them to be not necessarily an infallible god — far from that.  It is not possible for any country, however strongly tempted, to simply disregard the markets.  That has been attempted on a few occasion over the past 30 years by one or two governments in Europe but the attempt has not been successful or sustainable.I refer to some general points raised during the debate.  The phrase "jobless growth" originated in the late 1980s when growth came back into the economy but it was some time before there was an employment impact.  Since then employment has gone up from approximately 1.1 million to 1.8 million, at which it remains.  While we still have some positive job announcements, as yet, they are more than balanced out by job losses.  It is unfortunate that even when one has positive momentum in the economy, jobs, in net terms, tend to lag behind somewhat.I have the height of respect for the contribution and work of the Department of Finance but, nonetheless, I very much welcome the inquiry announced by the Minister for Fiance yesterday which, I believe, is in its interests.  It will give it an opportunity to vindicate its reputation and to identify areas which need to be strengthened.  Nobody has been without weaknesses in the past few years.The analysis given by Deputy O'Donnell, in particular, of Germany and the euro was valid.  One might think Germany was, in some way, a victim of the euro but that is far from the case.  If Germany had a separate currency, it would soar, in particular in current circumstances, in a way that would make German exports very uncompetitive.  Some of the sort of aura of political debate is that the Germans are huge beneficiaries.  That is being acknowledged increasingly by German commentators who realise where their interests lie.A debate is going on across the western world, not only in Europe but in America and in Britain in the context of the budget of a couple of days ago, on the relative weighting of a stimulus package versus financial consolidation and reduction of sovereign debt exposure.  There is a criticism of those who, like ourselves perhaps, emphasise most the reduction of debt exposure, that it is in some way killing off the economy, whether it is achievable and so on.  There has been a move in the past few months in the direction of giving a priority to reducing sovereign indebtedness.  That is against the background that several stronger economies had stimulus packages in the past couple of years.  We had no capacity to have a stimulus package.  The capital programme is important and we discussed a particular corner of that yesterday at the Select Committee on Finance and Public Service as it related to the Office of Public Works.There are reservations about to what extent a stimulus could be kept within the economy or leak out of it.  In the early 1980s, the then Fianna Fáil Government attempted to row against the tide and introduced a major capital programme in 1981 and 1982.  It gave a temporary boost to the economy but at the expense of seriously increasing the debt exposure.  Broadly speaking, Mitterand's France tried to do the same thing back in 1983 but it was not successful beyond the short term.The main emphasis must be on a sharp improvement in competitiveness, accepting that we had become exceptionally uncompetitive.  This is what we have been doing and we are already beginning to see some of the dividends.So far I have kept this contribution unpolitical in a party sense.  Naturally, any question of extending the tax base and in what particular direction is the prerogative of the Minister for Finance and the Government.  I am a little bemused in a detached sort of way by the reaction to the speculative report that appeared——

In some ways, the silly season has started early.  Only a few days ago, there was a story about people on Deputy O'Donnell's benches and on mine wanting to establish a new party.  The facts of the case may be that there is a lion, shall we say, outside this House who figured prominently in recent television programmes who might be interested in establishing a vehicle for re-entry and who has close links with Independent News and Media.

Many people, including one of my children, are in negative equity and face all the pressures that creates.  The last thing they want to hear about is a property tax.  If one was in any doubt about that, one need only listen to a few contributions on Joe Duffy's radio show yesterday.  On the other hand, a whole raft of experts — economic experts and economic institutions — suggest, as with third level fees, that the rational economic thing to do is to have a property tax.While, naturally, the Government tends to be reserved on its budgetary proposals ahead of the Budget Statement, nothing I say should be taken as detracting from that reserve.  The reaction, particularly from Deputy O'Donnell's party, has been immediately to tap into a populist vein rather than to subscribe to any of the so-called economic wisdom out there.

I am not certain that the decisions the Minister faces are as straightforward as has been presented.  There was a consensus, which included the ESRI, that Ireland was facing a soft landing based on the argument that it had fewer houses per head of population.  The director of the institute acknowledged that on radio earlier.  There were scattered warnings but the consensus was in other directions.  That is why we all have to learn lessons.One would not wish these types of experiences on any country or leader let alone ours but when they happen, one should try to derive what benefit one can from them.  For example, in the 1920s, Germany suffered hyperinflation and that lesson has lasted for generations.  We had a long-standing love affair with property and believed it was an unbeatable asset.  I suspect and I hope that we have been cured of that for good.I thank Deputies O'Donnell and Burton for their support for the Bill and their recognition of its importance.  There are opinion makers who are sharply opposed to our euro membership and there are even certain economists who skirt around the fringes.  A commentator in the Irish Examiner earlier this week suggested we would be better off on the outer fringe with Britain than in the eurozone, given the consequences for sovereignty and the inability to devalue and so on.  Devaluation can disguise falls in incomes.  It is a better course for us to accustom ourselves with and to internalise the logic of euro membership.  Most Members share my view that it is overwhelmingly in our interest to sustain our euro membership.  The Bill is not only about that, but also about sustaining the euro itself.  European countries must come through this serious challenge to the cohesion and sustainability of the euro.  When we overcome our current difficulties, we should understand fully what euro membership means.  We had the same problem when we joined the EMS in the late 1970s.  We did not immediately internalise the logic of that either but the alternative is to become a “low tax Anglo-American economic dependency”.  I do not see that as a good future for us.Without using any phrase that may offend Deputy Morgan, the Sinn Féin attitude to European legislation is relatively predictable.  As I said previously, the party in the North would like Northern Ireland to participate in the same currency as the South but that is not feasible.  I sometimes wonder about the cohesion of aspects of Sinn Féin economic policy according to whether it is articulated north or south of the Border.  It is the Deputy's entitlement to oppose the Bill but it is part of the logic of our euro membership.  He can make the argument that euro membership has, in some ways, contributed to our problems and to the problems of many other parts of Europe but, equally, with the problem having arisen — many of us remember the currency crisis of the early 1990s — it is an indispensable and essential shelter for us and it is the way forward for member states.  An independent Ireland, perhaps some time in the future a united Ireland in a united Europe, is the way forward.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I move amendment No.  a1:In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:"2.—The Minister shall not rely on any exemption set out in the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and 2003 in connection with a request for disclosure of material relating to the operation of this Act.".The purpose of the amendment is to subject the Irish part of the operation of this legislation to the Freedom of Information Acts.  On Second Stage, I raised the issue of the lack of information about NAMA, the absence of a business plan and the reports in today's newspapers about real estate opportunities and what might happen in regard to Battersea power station and the State's influence on, and participation in, that project as a consequence of NAMA.I wish to explain to the Minister that the reason for that is central to this Bill.  Europe and the eurozone area are experiencing an existential crisis.  The markets are now treated as a god — it is ironic that God did not get a mention in the European Constitution but we now have another god in the bond markets.  The stabilisation fund, which makes a lot of sense and which the Labour Party supports as an act of solidarity, is in effect a mechanism for putting a floor under countries such as Ireland, but also countries that have been even more in the news, such as Greece, Spain and Portugal which are under threat from the bond markets and may not be able to continue to obtain sovereign debt.My reflection was on the Irish position.  We are approaching the expiry date of the guarantee.  We do not know what the debt cliff for Ireland is because we have not been given solid information by the Minister.  In discussions last week he suggested that it might be €29 billion, but in answers to questions I put to him in April he suggested €74 billion.  I do not know what the figures are, but I believe that as the Labour Party spokesperson on finance, I should have a line of information about the figures.  Every other European Parliament has that facility.Given that we are now part of this protective fund — this aspect is not in the Bill, but it is germane to the general discussion — there will in the future be enhanced EU scrutiny over our budgetary and debt affairs.  That is why disclosure about NAMA is so important.  Anybody who is assessing the debt of Ireland will not just count the existing debt, but also the debt arising from the bank guarantee and the cost of the bank bailouts, such as the €22 billion put into Anglo Irish Bank and the €3.7 billion put into Irish Nationwide, both of which are goners.  That is about €27 billion that we have spent on two bank rescues, and we will be very lucky to see €3 billion of it, between the two banks, returned to us or made available for future banking requirements.The price of the stabilisation fund for countries such as Ireland is enhanced EU surveillance of both our budgetary processes and our debt burdens.  It is difficult to envisage the EU having those powers while the sovereign Irish Parliament does not have the same powers and does not have access to the information flow.  Fianna Fáil sometimes carries on as though it were the only party of Government in this country either in the past or in the future.  However, we have a parliamentary system and an Opposition, and the Opposition has a right, on behalf of the people, to have an account from Fianna Fáil of the implications for the country of the material that is in this Bill and the implicit commitments.We are signing up to accept, in this arrangement, enhanced surveillance of our budget process and our debt process.  We are doing that with no provision for the Irish Parliament — in particular, the Opposition — to be provided with at least the quality of information that will be made available to an unelected eurozone stabilisation fund management system.  Herr Regling, who recently produced a very good report with Mr. Watson, is the new boss appointed by Europe to be head of the commission.  He recently said that when he examined our property-based tax breaks, which he identified as a key cause of our collapse, he found, to his amazement, that they were three times larger than those of any other eurozone country.  He confessed himself to being astonished at that.Since the time I became Labour Party spokesperson — that is, from late 2002 or 2003 onwards — I have spent a vast amount of time seeking the truth about property-based tax breaks.  I have sought their names and identifications and costings.  Here we go again: we are now entering into a new procedure under which, down the road, it is quite possible that various European entities will solemnly advise the Government of Ireland to do this, that and the other with regard to our annual budget, spending, taxes, and debt liabilities.  They will communicate in private with the Minister, the Government and the Department, and we will know nothing about it until we hear the announcements on budget day.  This is unacceptable in a democracy.When I spoke last year at the Humbert Summer School in Ballina, I mentioned that we needed fundamental reform, including an office of the commissioner of the budget, which would report to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  That model exists in a number of other countries, including the United States, and there is a similar model in the UK.  Otherwise, we will have no information that will allow Members of the Dáil to exercise any influence or control over the consequences of Ireland's signing up to the stabilisation fund.  I have said on behalf of the Labour Party that I am in favour of the stabilisation fund.  It makes eminent sense to have such a solidarity package.  However, it is not a free option for Ireland.  It has enormous consequences for how we conduct our monetary and debt affairs as an independent country.The purpose of the Labour Party amendment is to make this legislation the subject of the Freedom of Information Act.  The stabilisation fund is not a federal institution, although it is seeking to have certain powers with regard to finance, budget and debt matters.  The sovereign states remain sovereign and, therefore, at the very least, if Fianna Fáil wishes to protect our sovereign democracy, the least we can expect is a right of access to information.  That is why I raised the issue of NAMA, which is in effect a secret organisation controlled by its board, the Department and the Minister for Finance.There is a major story in all the newspapers today about a prominent company in NAMA whose two principals have made announcements that one of their companies posted a loss of €1 billion last year.  The company is committed to a project at Battersea power station, and it is suggested in the newspapers that the cost of that development will be between €5 billion and €6 billion.As the information comes from them and not from the Department of Finance, I am assuming this information is broadly reliable.  They have indicated in their statements and information to journalists that they are hoping the Irish Government will allow them create some kind of special purpose vehicle for Battersea power station and it may well be that the Government, through NAMA, will be involved in financing that.  There may perhaps be a very solid case for this but I am not initially persuaded.It seems very odd that this country should be financing the rebuilding of the Battersea power station area and that part of London when, at the same time, there are 400,000 people unemployed in Ireland.  I need to hear the argument.  Most importantly, the information on this can be given in the public press.  I and others here are Dáil spokespersons on finance and we have no idea about the dimensions of the story, how much of it is correct and whether the financial figures given are correct.  I know that the same company, CREO, is shortly being listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.  I asked the Minister of State a question whether the principals involved in those companies have given guarantees to the Government, in the context of NAMA, or whether they will be able to float off to Singapore and come back when the rest of us have spent the next decade sorting out the effects of the crash.This is why freedom of information provisions in this legislation are important.  It does not necessarily involve a huge amount of information being available.  In any event, under the Lisbon treaty — as I am sure the Minister of State's officials will tell him  — Europe will be committed to publishing much of this information and making it available.  Why cannot Fianna Fáil accept that freedom of information should automatically apply to this legislation and be included in it?  If we could understand what is the exit strategy of the guarantee, what is the debt overhang, what are the implications of the Treasury Holdings, REO and CREO announcements on the Battersea power station project in the media today, we might be in a position to evaluate it.  As we do not have that information, it leads to people being extremely suspicious and rightly so.My second example is that last week, the Minister refused to have the economic policies of the Government included in the various reviews or the commission of inquiry.  Instead he said he had decided to send it to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for its consideration.  He was very expansive in saying that he would make any documents available, specifically, the minutes of the committee dealing with matters, I understand it is called the domestic standing group.  I am waiting for that information but so far I have not received it.  The Minister said he would make the Merrill Lynch report available because it did not recommend the blanket guarantee.  We know this because both Mr. Regling and Professor Honohan disclosed this fact in their respective reports.  We were never told by the Government.I put it to the Minister of State that had there been more freedom of information to start with, when people like myself raised questions about the state of the banks and questions about the property-based tax breaks, it may have been less comfortable for Fianna Fáil but it might have helped to head off the severity of the subsequent crash.  I cannot understand why the Government would not be more than happy to accept freedom of information applying in full to this legislation.

Deputy Burton has spoken on the main points.  NAMA is not subject to freedom of information legislation.  The Government introduced the NAMA Bill on foot of a draft business plan in which the figures were provided by the banks themselves.  These figures were not independently verified.  We were told there would be a business plan produced by the board but we have yet to see it.  It is interesting that the plan will not be produced until the end of this month.  The Minister stated in the House today that it will be published thereafter.  We have no figures.The Dáil is due to adjourn for the summer recess on 8 July.  There needs to be a proper debate in the House on the NAMA business plan but instead we are getting front page stories in the newspapers which, it is clear, have been leaked.  These are issues of concern to the taxpayer.  We were elected to represent the taxpayer.  NAMA will cost the taxpayer in the order of more than €45 billion.  I cannot see how it can make a return of money for the taxpayer.  The high-profile company, REO, has stated today it does not know whether NAMA has written off certain issues.  Two elements are required.  There needs to be a debate in the House on the NAMA business plan so that we can see what is happening.  Second, the Minister needs to come before the House to give details in respect of what is in the public domain at this stage.  The taxpayer is reading the front page of The Irish Times this morning and is asking what is happening.  This is not good enough.  It needs to be debated in the House.The bank guarantee scheme is due to conclude at the end of September and there may be an extension until the end of December.  This is a guarantee of €440 billion.  By sheer coincidence this is the same figure as the figure listed in this Bill, the European Financial Stability Facility Bill.  This illustrates the dimensions of the scale of the Irish bank guarantee scheme.  This Bill will protect the euro and its €440 billion guarantee scheme.  We are a population of 4 million people and with 13% of us unemployed.  We need to get real.  We need to have a proper debate in the House before the summer recess on the guarantee scheme.  The Minister saying he can bring it in by statutory instrument is not acceptable.  He is accountable to the House.  We need a proper debate.Deputy Burton is correct about the Merrill Lynch report.  The report was referred to in Professor Honohan's report.  The Merrill Lynch report stated that subordinated debt should not be included as part of the guarantee scheme.  However, we see lower tier 2 tucked in at the end of the guarantee scheme.  Many of the banks have converted subordinated debt that was outside the guarantee scheme into lower tier 2 and given a guarantee to the bondholders by exploiting the guarantee scheme to make that happen and at a cost to the taxpayer.  They have brought subordinated debt, which was not included in the guarantee scheme, in by the back door.They said this debt was lower tier 2 and would fall under the guarantee.Who asked for the subordinated debt to be included?  It was the banks who asked for this — AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Therefore, we have on the one hand a reputable international firm like Merrill Lynch that does not include subordinated debt, but on the other we have two big banks who I presume asked the Minister for the Finance and the Taoiseach for subordinated debt to be included.  As a result it has been.The Government has played a three-card trick in terms of lower tier 2.  We need a proper debate that will examine the wide-ranging issues in this regard. Between subordinated and senior debt, there is some €8 billion in Anglo Irish Bank currently.  A question must be asked as to whether subordinated debt will be included in the new scheme.  It appears it will not.  However, will existing senior debt be included?  In the context of Anglo Irish Bank, it should not be included.  This would create a situation where the bondholders would share in the pain and we would save money on behalf of the taxpayer rather than put more into Anglo Irish Bank.  We have already had one flush of the toilet for Anglo Irish Bank and do not need a second one.We need a proper debate in the House on the business plan for NAMA.  We need clarification from the Minister on the REO company and the two high-profile individuals involved in the development of the Battersea Power Station.  What exactly is happening in that regard?  We need clarity on how taxpayers money is being spent.  The issue is accountability.We also need a proper informed debate on the bank guarantee scheme.  We want to analyse it line by line.  We have time to do that.  The scheme was introduced on 30 September and we backed it.  However, we want greater detail on what will happen in this regard in the future.  We have the time to deal with that and should use it.Let us publish the Merrill Lynch report.  As early as July 2008, I requested that the CEOs of the main banks would appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  They told us the banking system was solid and robust.  I also called for the Governor of the Central Bank to appear, who also said the system was solid and robust.  I asked for Mr. Neary, the former CEO of the Financial Regulator to appear and was told the banks were solid and there were no problems with them.  Merrill Lynch stated subordinated debt should not be included.  In his report, Professor Honohan questioned whether subordinated debt should have been included and said it has cost the taxpayer money.The Government is considering the introduction of property taxes and hitting the small man.  Fianna Fáil is the big man's party, but we are elected to represent all citizens.  People will read on the front page of today's newspapers that some high profile developers are seeking capital from NAMA.  Fianna Fáil established NAMA, but there is no business plan for it.  If the Minister went into a bank with a draft business plan, the bank would throw it back at him and tell him not to come back until he had a final plan.  Irish people are entitled to see a final business plan for NAMA and are entitled to a debate on it in the House.  I want confirmation that will happen.There has been no requirement for the Taoiseach to express his views on the various reports, including the Regling and Honohan reports, that have been produced.  The Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service is holding hearings. As Taoiseach and former Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen should agree to appear before the committee.  We should not need his agreement for this, but he should appear as a matter of course and accountability.  The current Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, should also appear.  These hearings should be held in public.There should also be public hearings for the commission of inquiry.  We need accountability and we need to restore the people's trust in the political system.  Instead, all we have are leaks here and there to the media about what is being done, with the main players keeping quiet about what is happening.  Government policy is dictated by Ministers, not officials.  Officials implement policy and provide advice.  We need information on the thought processes behind what has happened, particularly with regard to the tax incentive schemes.  These were key elements to driving the property bubble over the edge and into the Irish Sea.  I support the amendment.

While I am opposed to the Bill, I am realistic enough to know it is likely to be passed this afternoon.  It would be a better Bill for having some level of transparency attached to it.  I will also support Deputy O'Donnell's amendments with regard to the laying before the Oireachtas of reports on matters connected with the Bill.  This would lead to more openness and transparency and to accountability.  I support the comments of Deputy Burton relating to events concerning the speculators and the Battersea Power Station.  Vast amounts of taxpayers' money will be poured into something on which we have no fine detail.  It is critical taxpayers' moneys are not spent until the Oireachtas has had an opportunity to debate the spending of such vast sums.  That money could be spent, for example, on the retention of special needs assistants in school and so on.The Minister is aware of and does not need a lecture from me on the acute needs that exist in society.  I would like to see the €5 billion or €6 billion spent in more creative ways than, perhaps, will be the case.   The proposed vast expenditure of money in that regard demonstrates that NAMA is about bailing out developers.  This is confirmation of that if it was ever needed.

It would have the effect of exempting information under this facility to the existing standard protections of the freedom of information legislation with regard to commercially sensitive or confidential information of various kinds.  Recently, we discussed the Freedom of Information Act, and if an amendment was to be made, that would have been the place to do it.  I accept the point about the importance of information, but the release of commercially sensitive information must be structured rather than haphazard.  Given the way freedom of information works, anybody can request information and what issues is not as structured as we would like.The Deputy seeks to amend the Bill so that it ignores the terms of the Freedom of Information Act with regard to any request for information regarding loans made under this legislation.  The Freedom of Information Act is a tried and tested mechanism for providing access to public information, subject to a carefully designed system of checks and balances, all in the public interest.  Any request for information relating to loans under this new Bill can be dealt with effectively under freedom of information, taking account of the various safeguards in the Freedom of Information Act.The purpose of this amendment, if accepted, would be to exclude the various provisions dealing with commercially sensitive information, agreements with other member states and the State's negotiating position, from being used as reasons to withhold sensitive information.  Were the parties opposite to be in Government following the next election, it would be highly unlikely that they would accept the amendments they have tabled from their present position.Deputy Burton's point about the European Union being an organisation of sovereign states and not a federal state is true.  I might point out that under present procedures, stability reports, which effectively are reports to the European Union but which people here also can see and read at the same time, are published with the budget.  I have stated in this Chamber previously that the interest of the European Union is overwhelmingly with the macroeconomic thrust of a budget, rather than with individual measures, except in so far as they have a particular impact on that.  As is the case at present, in practice there will be a great deal of transparency, certainly once a budget is published, with regard to the transactions with the European Union.  In a sense, the question to be raised, not only in respect of our budget but of every other eurozone budget, is whether it is consistent with the stability of the European Union.  This already is implicit in the stability reports and programmes that are published with the budget but because of events that have happened, will be thrust forward much more.If I may stray a little beyond the precise focus of the amendment, I was a colleague of Deputy Burton on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service between the years 2002 and 2007 and on the select committee from 2007 to 2008.  I well recall and do not dispute her critical attitude to property incentives.  I do not seek any particular foreknowledge or justification but I refer to a point about incentives that the Government did not follow properly.  Even when they are given, and some of them, such as those pertaining to urban renewal and so on were very useful for a period, they should not be long drawn-out.  They should be put in place and then removed.  Moreover, some of the schemes introduced were of doubtful value even in the first place.  The seaside scheme is one in question, for which the former Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Kenny dispute the credit.  In fairness to Deputy Kenny, Westport looks good but I believe the scheme at Courtown, County Wexford was heavily criticised.

I did not debate that point.  However, as was pointed out to Deputy O'Donnell in a recent debate, his party tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill seeking to introduce property incentives for primary health centres.  The same lobbyists approached me and while I was polite and diplomatic, I did not bother referring the proposal to the Minister for Finance but told them to take a running jump at themselves because the medical profession in general are well paid and well rewarded.  Far too much has been done in this regard.  In the vast majority of instances, the beneficiaries of such schemes are those who have, or in the past at any rate had, a great deal of wealth and money.  It almost has been a case of trying to sugar the pill of the impact of the taxation system on them, as though it needed to be sugared.

It was as though the rigours of a top rate of tax of 41% and so on was much too much for such people to bear.  Perhaps there also was an element of a suggestion that unless such incentives were in place here, such people might go to another jurisdiction where they could avail of incentives instead.  I believe that Members rightly are highly critical in this regard.  Moreover, the love affair with property must be broken once and for all.  If it is worthwhile to build things in general, it should not require the subvention or incentivisation of the taxpayer.  I acknowledge that when the country was much poorer, 20 years ago or more, there may have been a limited case for a period.  The provisions of section 23 of the Finance Act 1981 and the urban renewal schemes did play a role at a certain period.  However, it all went on for far too long and this criticism is universally accepted.However, while Deputies Burton, O'Donnell and Morgan, have legitimate questions and concerns about the operation of NAMA and the guarantee scheme, they must be pursued in their own right.  I do not believe they justify the inclusion of this amendment, which relates to the operation of the European Financial Stability Facility Bill.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	197	By way of clarification, the tax incentive schemes were continued for too long and a premium was always paid on top.  If a particular residential property was tax designated, there was a premium on the cost of that house.  Two by-products arose from that.  A young couple or ordinary person who bought a house on such an estate was completely compromised because effectively, they were paying over the odds.  In addition, this had the effect of increasing the overall cost of housing on the general market.  Tax designated houses were built that probably should never have been built and it all has crystallised in developer debt and in unaffordable mortgages being taken out by ordinary people.  The latter now are the people who are in negative equity and those responsible for the construction of the former are the developers who have gone into NAMA and who are being helped by the taxpayer.As for the particular instance of the primary medical centres, it is a stand-alone issue that has no knock-on effect on the wider economy.  These tax incentives had implications for debt with the banks in respect of schemes being built and implications for ordinary mortgage holders who paid over the odds for houses.  That fuelled the property bubble at a time when it should have been counter-cyclical.  It was pro-cyclical in the extreme.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I thank the Minister of State for his interesting reply.  It is helpful that we would reflect on tax incentives.  It is obvious that they are meant to be used in depressed economies or to address non-activity.  They should be fully costed and the dead weight involved in them should be clearly set out.  They should also be for a limited period.  They have their place in terms of financial measures but given the degree to which they have become discredited, one of the things the European Union review group will do when it arrives in this country is look askance at them.  One needs to be careful strategically.  That is where the Department of Finance and the Minister have fallen down badly.  As the jewel in the crown in terms of tax incentives we have a lower rate of corporation tax with which not everyone agrees, but given our island status is in my view and that of most parties in the House something that is strategically important in attracting and retaining investment.That is another reason to have public information.  Corporation tax is the important incentive that this country should retain as a priority.  My guess is that following both the Regling and Honohan reports that when the EU review group visits on the kind of missions that will be carried out as a consequence of the legislation this would be one of the first areas it will examine.  If I was on the review group, that would the first area I would examine.  In his reply to a question posed in the committee by a Fianna Fáil member to Mr. Regling about whether the country had failed, Mr. Regling got quite philosophical and asked how we could have failed when the average income in the country is still above the EU level.  That spoke volumes about his mindset in terms of what he thought was this country's capacity for taking more in terms of pain and cuts.The various parties in the Dáil are competent in regard to information.  The Department of Finance does not have to think that the Members of the Opposition are children from which all information is to be hidden and it is only to be dragged out.  However, if I become Minister for Finance next week, then I am to be the repository of all information.  The approach to information is childish.  It may be that the Department would say its only duty is to advise the Minister of the day but given the changes that are implicit in the Bill and the EU oversight that is coming, we must do some hard thinking about structural, institutional change both within this House and within Government as to how we respond to the new situation.It is obvious that we must try to reduce the debt burden because all the indications are that the bond markets, the gods, are spooked and they will not get over that probably for a considerable period.  Therefore, we will be subject to a great deal of scrutiny.  Some of the people within the EU are really strong deficit hawks.  That means they do not mind seeing mass unemployment continue over a long period.  They want draconian fiscal austerity.  To quote Senator Eoghan Harris, they almost want to see "the blood on the blouse" to show that the country is taking the hit.  There is another school of thought among economists who are largely described as being doves in terms of their views on the deficit who believe that unemployment and maintaining the social fabric of society in the long run is the more important issue.  In the end we may have a compromise between those two views.  Social democrats take the second view.  If one has continuing mass unemployment and all the destruction that that implies, the eurozone will not last either.Let us remember that the European Union was created to end wars where European workers went to battle against each other.  That is what the European Union is about.  The Minister of State has argued about why the Bill should not be included under the terms of freedom of information legislation.  That is a mistake.  This country prospered particularly well from the time we as a country opened up.  Ministers are fond of talking about our cultural heritage, especially post-Farmleigh.  However, we should remember that for many decades of the early years of this State the remarkable thing about our cultural heritage, which is so important to everyone, is that most artists felt they had to go outside this country in order to prosper, have freedom to write and express themselves.  Since the early 1990s, especially since the election of Mary Robinson as President, we have had an opening out and a confidence building within society which partly produced our economic success.  We are now saying we should go back and identify our strengths.I put it to the Minister of State that censorship in the early decades of the State was not the best way of growing this country.  Opening up and opening out to freedom of information is always difficult.  All of us know about the pesky freedom of information requests about how many times we signed in using the fob.  It can be terribly irritating, especially for people who find it one more burden.  Equally, the principle of freedom of information is quite liberating.  It has been for this country.  I accept the Minister of State is not a free agent in terms of his own view of how this issue might be dealt with but it merits consideration if we are to get, as it were, into recovery mode as a country and as a society.

However, the other end of the scale is that we all suffer from an overload of information too so it is a question of distinguishing the wood from the trees.  In general, I agree with the opening up of information.  Lemass had a striking phrase about piercing the green curtain, the argument being that we were too much of a closed society where debate was in a narrow range and any breach of consensus resulted in experiences such as that suffered by Hubert Butler who experienced semi-ostracisation.  That was the experience of some of our writers.Freedom of information legislation results, in effect, in the random release of information according to requests that may be made from any source.  I accept we need more information but it must be structured around the specific area related to the Bill.  We have made progress.  Deputy Burton is aware that, for example, the papers of the tax strategy group are released post-budget.To return to Deputy O'Donnell's point about incentives, I accept houses were built where they should not have been built.  That was obvious in my capacity in the OPW when observing the effects of last November's floods.  As part of the sub-prime debate in the United States it was evident that it was not just wicked right-wing capitalists that favoured the development of the sub-prime mortgage system, it was also people with Democrat or social democratic instincts who wanted to make available to the widest number of people the possibility of owning their own home.That is also what has in general motivated public policy.  It is the case that practically all incentives for house ownership push up house prices.  Perhaps we should have realised it sooner or, having realised it, acted on it sooner.  The real beneficiary of an incentive may not be the nominal beneficiary.  That is why schemes that were attractive in the early 1980s, such as the grant of £1,000 for first-time buyers, fall into the category I describe.Mortgage interest relief is to be phased out completely by 2017 — I believe that is the correct time.  It is because the schemes, while they appear to be helping people, are not actually doing so.  They are, as Deputy O'Donnell correctly said, simply pushing up market prices with no real benefit to the purchasers.  We have learned that and are perhaps acting upon it somewhat too late in the day.Deputy Burton acknowledged the instinct many people have to prioritise addressing unemployment and the social fabric over debt.  My instincts are in the same direction.  However, the problem is that if most countries rightly or wrongly move in another direction that requires a focus on the consolidation and reduction of sovereign debt, we have limited scope to move in a direction of our own without causing a crisis of confidence.  Deputy Bruton is probably correct in her conclusion, namely, that there must ultimately be, perhaps on an ongoing basis, a compromise between the two different points of view.  The assault on the euro by the markets earlier this year made it necessary to accord higher priority to debt reduction.  The legislative measure we are discussing today is a direct result of it.We must determine what freedom of action we have.  It would be wrong to say the Government has no freedom of action because there are always choices.  At the same time, freedom of action is not always as unlimited as it sometimes may appear.  I am not suggesting for one moment Deputy Burton is arguing it is; it am just referring to appearances in debate.To return to the essential point, information release is important but it must be structured.  In the opinion of the Government, freedom of information provisions do not comprise the suitable vehicle in this context.  This legalisation is only ultimately about the European financial stability facility.  It is not about any other issue.

In page 4, subsection (1), to delete line 33 and substitute the following:"5.—(1) No later than two weeks after receipt of the quarterly basis report from the EFSF to the euro-area Member States under Article 13(3) of the EFSF Framework agreement as set out in Schedule, on the outstanding claims and liabilities under the Loan Facility Agreements, EFSF Funding Instruments issues and the Guarantees, the Minister shall lay the report before Dáil Éireann.(2) In respect of each reporting period the Minister shall, as".I will speak to amendment No. 1 but will make reference to all the others because they are quite similar.  They are amendments on reporting.  Article 13(3) of the framework agreement requires the company to submit a quarterly report to all the member states.  I ask that the Government place the report before the Houses within two weeks of receiving it.  That is pretty straightforward.As referred to in the Euro Area Loan Facility Act, the European Commission's quarterly report to member states should be laid before the Houses within two weeks of receipt by the Government.Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, seek a breakdown of figures, not just aggregate figures but also individual guarantees and advancements, and information on whether guarantees have expired.  Thus, we would have detail on each member state every six months.Amendments Nos. 6 and 7, pertaining to section 5, deal with moneys received by the State up to the end of the relevant period.  Amendment No. 8 requires to be reported the full schedule of future guarantees that may be issued or expired that the Government is aware of, in addition to a "schedule of contribution by the state to the capital and other costs of the Company and any other expenses incurred".  This is to know what we are spending on share capital and general running expenses.Section 6 provides for an amendment to section 4 of the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010.  Amendment No. 9 seeks that the quarterly report received from the European Commission under Article 10(3) of the intercreditor agreement as set in Schedule 1 be laid before the House within two weeks of its receipt.I seek that the six-monthly report by the Government give a detailed breakdown, and not just aggregate figures, of the moneys repaid by Greece and of the advances.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 concern advancements to Greece and amendments Nos. 13 and 14 concern moneys received.  Amendment No. 15 seeks the insertion of "schedule of expected future moneys to be advanced by the state".What I seek is in line with amendment a1, tabled by Deputy Burton.  I require information and disclosure.  There is nothing in this context that should not be in the public domain.  The information will be received by the Government.  In the interest of accountability and transparency, the quarterly reports by the European financial stability facility company on financial stability should be laid before the Dáil two weeks after their receipt.  The European Commission’s quarterly report should also be laid before the Houses two weeks after its receipt.I seek a breakdown in respect of the European Financial Stability Bill for individual guarantees — individual amounts for individual member states.  In terms of the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010, we would get a breakdown on individual advances and repayments, and one might say future repayments or advances for Greece.These are reasonable administrative amendments.  I hope the Minister will accept them in the spirit they are intended and that they will be accommodated and taken on board by Government.

Unfortunately, not.On amendment No. 1, Article 13(3) of the EFSF Framework agreement provides for quarterly reports from the EFSF to the member states.  It is not possible at this stage to be specific about the detailed content of such reports and it is possible that some elements of reporting may contain confidential or commercially sensitive information.  That said, it would be the intention to incorporate as much detail in these reports in so far as these reports are publicly available and we will endeavour to ensure that Deputies are informed accordingly.Taking amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together, the provision in the Bill allows for full details to be provided on guarantees.  In respect of an individual beneficiary country, a funding programme will be approved and guaranteed at the outset.  Although the loans will normally be issued in individual tranches, some elements of the guarantee will be issued in advance of the others.  It is, of course, intended to report fully and timely on all such aspects.In the case of amendments Nos. 4 and 5, I want to explain that under this facility the company will be responsible for raising funds to provide loans if needed to member states.  Ireland, as such, will not be making advances to member states, and Deputy O'Donnell well understands that.  However, information provided on EFSF funding programmes will, of course, identify any implications for Ireland and other member states as guarantors and we will endeavour to ensure that Deputies are informed accordingly of such loans.In the case of amendments Nos. 6 and 7, I confirm that the existing provision under section 5 will include all of this information where relevant.  Full and comprehensive reports will ensure that the Dáil is kept fully informed.  While appreciating the detail of Deputy O'Donnell's proposals, we are satisfied that it is already accommodated and for that reason, I cannot accept the amendments.On amendments No. 8, Deputy O'Donnell will appreciate that it may not be possible to anticipate all future developments under this facility but it is intended yet again to provide full information on all future transactions connected with approved programmes for any beneficiary member states and related loan facility agreements.  It is not possible at this stage to be specific about the detailed content of such reports, and again it is possible that some elements of reporting may contain confidential or commercially sensitive information.  That said, it would be in the intention to incorporate as much detail in these reports in so far as these reports are publicly available.This section of the Bill sets out the basic legitimate requirements to ensure the House is kept informed, not only on any guarantees issued but also on the operation of the EFSF company, of which a EFC representative will be a director.  It is the intention to give Deputies as many details as possible and for that reason, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.On section 6, amendment No. 9, there is provision for quarterly reports from the European Commission to the lenders.  It is not possible at this stage to be specific about the detailed content of such reports, and again there may be confidential or commercially sensitive information.  Subject to that caveat, however, it would be the intention to incorporate as much detail in these reports as publicly available.On amendments Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive, I confirm to Deputy O'Donnell that the existing provision under section 6 will include all of this information where relevant and feasible.  This section of the Bill sets out the basic legitimate requirements to ensure the House is kept informed.  It is the intention to give Deputies as many details as possible and this is implicitly provided for under the wording in the case of both Acts which refers to a report to the Dáil that includes certain information but is not limited to such information.  For that reason, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.On amendment No. 15, the loan agreements are based on quarterly disbursements to Greece.  It is not possible to provide an expected schedule of future moneys at this stage but overall Ireland's expenditure over the three year period cannot exceed €1.5 billion under the terms of this Bill.  The intention is that according as conditions improve, Greece will be in a position to return to the markets and that the full amount of the loan facility might not be required.  That said, a degree of front loading of our commitment may arise but this does not affect the overall limit.  For that reason, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to introduce the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010 and I look forward to an informed debate during its passage through the House.  As the House is aware, the renewed programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce legislation to prohibit the practice of deer hunting with a pack of dogs.  This short Bill provides for the banning of this particular hunting practice.  In addition, I have taken the opportunity to increase the maximum fines for wildlife related offences, which were last increased in 2000.I would like to put on the record of the House the fact that the decision to prohibit the hunting of deer with a pack of hounds was not taken lightly.  Section 26(1) of the 1976 Act provides that I, as Minister, may grant to the master or other person in charge of a pack of stag hounds a licence authorising the hunting of deer by that pack during such period or periods as is or are specified in the licence.  However, the Act does not provide criteria for awarding or refusing a licence.As Deputies are aware, there is only one stag hound pack in the State, which operates in County Meath.  When I became Minister in June 2007, I had concerns from an animal welfare and a public safety point of view relating to the operation of the hunt meetings operated by the hunt club in question.  These concerns were shared by some of my predecessors.The hunt club in question maintains a herd of domesticated red deer in purpose-built deer parks that adjoin its hunt kennels.  Its hunting season normally runs from mid-October to the end of March.  Approximately 50 meetings are held during this period.  It is not acceptable to allow a hunt with hounds and horses of what is essentially a farm animal.  We do not consider it acceptable to set dogs in pursuit of any other farmed animal.  Furthermore, there are public safety issues, as it is simply not possible for the hunt to prevent deer in flight from leaping through hedges onto public roads.  I recall an incident last December during one of their hunt meetings when a deer had to be put down after it had leapt onto a road and collided with a car.  I find this incident totally unacceptable even though I understand that fortunately on that occasion there were no injuries to the occupants of the car.  Many Deputies are aware of a previous serious incident when a deer being chased by the hounds leaped into a school yard just as the school day was finishing.  At the time there was a great deal of disquiet about this type of hunting.  I have been told about other incidents anecdotally, but from reliable sources, that suggest these are not isolated incidents.The Government, therefore, decided the animal welfare and public safety concerns relating to stag hunting could only be addressed by banning this hunting practice.  The Bill itself is short and simple.  Section 2 provides for the deletion of the section in the 1976 Wildlife Act that allows me as Minister to grant a licence for the hunting of deer with pack of hounds.Section 3 seeks to achieve a number of objectives.  First, it redefines deer for the purposes of the legislation so that the term includes any deer that is not a wild animal.  This expanded definition of "deer" has been incorporated into the Bill to ensure there is no argument that the hunting of captive deer might not require a licence under the Wildlife Acts.Second, it makes it an offence to hunt deer with two or more dogs but it provides for a situation where it may be necessary to pursue deer with two or more dogs, if a person has received permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts.  Section 42 offers a facility, outside the open season, whereby a person can obtain permission, on a case by case basis, to take action against a protected species, including deer, which can include the scaring, capturing or killing of the said species in a situation where serious damage is being caused to agricultural corps, forestry plantations, other fauna, etc.  There may be occasions when it is necessary or useful to bring dogs to assist in moving deer from areas where they are causing serious damage, for example, in young forestry plantations.  It is good practice to use dogs to assist in the recovery of fallen deer.Since the Bill was published some groups representing deer stalkers have raised an issue with officials of my Department relating to section 3, which might inadvertently affect their legitimate hunting practices.  It is not unusual for a deer stalker to bring a dog hunting deer.  This is especially true in woodlands, where a dog can be used to retrieve fallen game that sometimes can be concealed in undergrowth.  In cases where several hunters are stalking deer on a property and each had a dog, or if they were bringing two dogs for training purposes, it could be construed that they were breaking the law based on section 3.  It was never my intention that the Bill should place any restriction on lawful deer stalking.  Accordingly, in order to allay these fears, I will table an amendment on Committee Stage, such that it is not an offence for people stalking deer and with a deer licence to have more than two dogs.I will table a further amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to address a problem which has recently arisen in regard to licences to shoot game during the open seasons.  The Wildlife Act requires a hunter to have a licence to hunt certain birds, such as wildfowl, and hares, and made provision that this would be obtained as an endorsement on the hunter's firearm certificate.  Both the hunting licence and the firearm certificate were issued by An Garda Síochána in the form of a shotgun licence with the appropriate endorsement for hunting.However, when new, computerised procedures were introduced in 2009 for issuing three-year firearms certificates, the facility for issuing the endorsement as a wildlife hunting licence was omitted.  As a result, new firearms certificates do not provide for a hunting licence attachment and therefore do not meet the legal requirements of the existing Wildlife Acts.  Consequently, hunters issued with new firearms certificates were not be able to hunt legally.  I understand that by the time the oversight was identified, it was not practicable to recall the certificates issued nor to change the licensing process in train.In order to address this problem, I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to amend the Wildlife Acts so that a firearms certificates issued for a shotgun, between 1 August 2009 and 1 August 2012, will be deemed to be a hunting licence for game species such as wildfowl and hares.  In the interim, arrangements will be made between my Department and the Department of Justice and Law Reform to revert to a situation where the hunting licence is endorsed on the firearms certificate.  This does not affect the current system of issuing licences for shooting deer.I refer to the other part of the Bill relating to the increase in penalties for wildlife related crime.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for increased penalties for offences under the Wildlife Acts.  I have decided to increase these penalties, as they have not been increased since 2000.  I am increasing maximum fines such that on summary conviction the maximum fine is increased to €1,000 from £500 for a first offence, to €2,000 from £1,000 for a second offence and to €5,000 from £1,500 for a third or subsequent offence.  In addition, the maximum fine for conviction on indictment is increased to €100,000 from £50,000.  There are no changes in maximum times of imprisonment terms.I consider it vitally important that the State uses every means at its disposal to ensure our natural heritage is protected.  This includes our wildlife and habitats.  In this international year of biodiversity, we must continue to maintain and enhance our wildlife under the obligations of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.  The new penalties proposed in the Bill are proportionate.  I am sure the House will support the increased fines.Turning to general reaction to the proposed legislation, I reject the notion that this Bill is an attack on country pursuits.

Let us have some facts and figures to dispel this notion.  In 2007, my first year in office as Minister, there were over 4,500 various licences issued by my Department under the Wildlife Acts.  The corresponding figure for 2009 was over 6,200 licences.  Approximately 70% of these licences are issued to deer stalkers who, needless to say, will not be affected by this legislation.

The vast majority of people involved in legal hunting in this country will have nothing to fear from the enactment of this Bill.  My Department will still be issuing licences for deer hunting.  Fox hunting is not affected by this Bill.While I appreciate the hunt has been in operation for over 150 years, the banning of stag hunting with hounds does not necessarily mean the members of the hunt must give up hunting activities altogether.  The hunt has the option of continuing their local hunting, perhaps as a drag hunt which would still allow them to use hounds.

That animal would be running for its life, and the deer in Meath is running for its life.  That is unacceptable and uncivilised.I reiterate that the Bill as published has two main purposes: to ban the practice of hunting deer with a pack of hounds and to increase the various fines for wildlife related offences.  As I have outlined, I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to resolve the issues of licences to shoot wild game.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Fine Gael will be opposing this legislation.  I know that does not cause the Minister any surprise, no more than it causes any surprise that he would bring forward narrow legislation at a time of serious economic and social problems in the country, but the zealousness with which he spoke and the commitment he has given towards this agenda surprises most people in the House.We all have known for a long time that the Minister has a solid commitment towards the removal of animal field sports throughout the country.  He and his party are on record calling for the banning of live cattle exports, and he has been photographed on a number of occasions on protest marches in regard to those issues.  It is not credible for the Minister to suggest this is not the thin end of the wedge in terms of many other field sports.  His actions in the past confirm that he will not fool anybody when he states that this is not the thin end of the wedge and that he has another agenda that will continue into the future as long as he is Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.It is interesting that at the end of a very busy Dáil session, where €22 billion have been effectively thrown down the Suwannee by the Government in respect of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank, we are discussing the priorities of the Green Party, which are the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill and the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, and a directly elected mayor of Dublin, which the Minister promised for the end of the year but which we now know, although the Minister has yet to admit it, will not happen this year, despite him seeking to give the perception that it will happen.The commitment to ban stag hunting in the revised programme for Government was not part of the original programme for Government in 2007.  The Fianna Fáil Party, which was the major partner in Government, did not get a mandate from the people of this country to introduce this legislation.  Six Members out of a total of 166 have decided that 154 years of countryside tradition in terms of the Ward Union Hunt should be put aside.The worthless document that was a classic example of shameless spin to get over certain problems in the economy produced in the revised programme for Government in 2009 is now seen for what it is, namely, that the majority of the membership of the Green Party at those conferences were more interested in animal welfare issues being included in the revised programme for Government such as dog breeding and the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, than they were in the serious issues of the National Asset Management Agency, the banking crisis and the fiscal and budgetary parameters for 2010.  In a cynical manoeuvre the Minister got his party members on side for the purpose of other serious issues because he was able to get some commitments from Fianna Fáil in writing about matters relating to animal welfare.  The soothing noises of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, at the time, one of the key Fianna Fáil negotiators, that all would be fine on the day and that this will not happen in a hurry — he even suggested to some backbenchers that it might not happen at all — have been proven to be nought because of the Minister's zealousness and eagerness to ensure he and his members were able to get this legislation before the House today.  The soothing noises of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to the Fianna Fáil backbenchers is now seen for what it is — it is not worth the paper on which it was written.The commitment to ban stag hunting should be viewed in that light.  It is an ideological political commitment that is important to a very small group of people but not important to the overall population because they are concerned with issues relating to the banking inquiry and the bankers' report.  The are interested in issues relating to jobs and public expenditure matters for 2011.  They are interested in the cover-up and the investigations in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  They are interested in slashing allowances for the blind, people with disabilities and children.  They are interested in the removal of medical cards from the elderly.  They are interested in the Green Party voting in the Dáil to support the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, Deputy Bertie Ahern and the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, when we know their hearts were not in it, to ensure their continued survival.  They are interested in voting down all attempts for democratic consideration of three constituency by-elections, and they are overseeing a system of local government which is being strangled on a daily basis by the Minister in meeting the requirements and the remit in terms of various issues such as wasterwater and matters relating to waste.Ultimately, the response of this country will be the taxpayer picking up the tab to meet European Union fines.  Those are the issues that are of interest to the people, not interesting discussions of an ideological and zealous nature concerning the Ward Union Hunt.  That is the record of the Green Party, and the people are beginning to see through that now.My good friend, Deputy Sargent, and I had a little chat about this matter on national radio this morning and he introduced a new dimension, which is that it is a road safety issue.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	273	It was a scare tactic.  In a liberal society people who get into a car take a risk.  The Deputy is saying that for some reason people who hunt animals for commercial purposes across roadways are taking their lives in their hands and that people coming around the bend on the road will run into those animals.  He failed to tell the people that this activity is happening under strict licensing conditions and monitoring, and that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are supervising it on behalf of the State to make sure it is appropriate.  They cannot do that when cows are crossing the road.We see that all the tenuous arguments trotted out to sustain an ideological argument are nothing more than ideology.  It has nothing to do with the practical implementation of these matters but more to do with the zealousness by which the Minister wants to pursue a narrow political and ideological agenda.The Ward Union stag hunt is the only licensed one in the Republic of Ireland.  Hunting deer has a long history dating from the 19th century.  The hunting area comprises north County Dublin together with south and east Meath.  Hunting takes place infrequently two days a week during the season from November to March each year.  The Ward Union Hunt maintains its own herd of 150 Irish red deer.  If the legislation is approved, what does the Minister intend to do with this herd?The union hunt stags are not generally killed but are recaptured and returned to the herd.  The Ward Union Hunt has been required to apply for a licence annually since 1977 from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Each stag in the herd is hunted once a year and is supervised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wildlife officers and veterinarians.  The health of the stag is checked before and after the hunt and stress levels are recorded.This is a system that takes account of animal welfare in a serious way and with which no one has had a problem until the Minister decided to think otherwise.  The Ward Union Hunt has 200 members and contributes €1.4 million annually to the economy.  Research carried out by NUI Galway indicates the enormous contribution made by field sports and rural pursuits to the economy.There is an anti-rural bias to the Minister's agenda.  He has displayed this at protest marches over the years and there are plenty of photographs to show it.

There is plenty of evidence to show his narrow political pursuit on these matters.Fine Gael believes the hunt plays an important cultural and economic role in rural Ireland, something I would not expect the Green Party to appreciate or understand.  With the Green Party in Government there is no guarantee that this ban does not represent the thin edge of the wedge with more country pursuits to be banned in the following months and years.  In Opposition and as part of its election manifesto in the last general election, the Green Party was committed to stopping live animal exports, a matter with which Deputy Sargent would be very familiar.

Not one Member of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party spoke out against the approval of the revised programme for Government which included a commitment to ban stag hunting and the Ward Union Hunt.  Why should any Fianna Fáil Member be surprised this Bill is debated here this evening when they could have opposed it as far back as November 2009?We will see evidence of the representations those individual Deputies received and the commitments they have given when it comes to voting on this legislation.  There is no point in having soothing noises afterwards.  This is the opportunity for Members to tell the Minister enough is enough, that we do not want this legislation that will ban a countryside tradition and organisation that has been in place since 1824 and has been monitored and licensed by this State to ensure it carries out its responsibilities.  I hope the narrow ideological agenda this legislation is pursuing will be seen for what it is and the House will reject this Bill on Second Stage.

People in rural communities feel under threat from this legislation and are concerned it is the thin end of the wedge.

It is a last-ditch attempt to achieve something in a Government in which the Greens have achieved little.  To achieve this trophy prize, the Minister will divide communities and his proposals will have an effect on areas he will claim was never his intention.  People will lose their livelihoods because of this legislation.  The Minister took no account of this possibility when drafting the legislation.This Bill has nothing to do with the Green Party's principles because it was never in the original programme for Government.  It was only when a gun was effectively put to Fianna Fáil's head was that this legislation was included in the revised programme for Government.  It is simply an attempt to save a Green Party seat or two at the next election.The Minister consulted none of the stakeholders when drawing up the legislation.  It has economic consequences for communities and has done nothing to bring them on board.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The Minister not only does not consult people about legislation, he then refuses to listen to the debate about it in the Chamber.  That is not the way to go about legislating on a matter as divisive and controversial as this.  The Minister is doing this at a time when we need rural and urban communities to work together to bring the economy back on track.At a meeting with senior departmental officials and Wild Deer Ireland, a commitment was given that a consultation process would begin to address the concerns over the impact of the legislation on legitimate deer-hunters and deer-stalkers.  To date, no consultation has taken place.Wild Deer Ireland raised this issue at the recent meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It also mentioned that Coillte was very concerned about the legislation.  I refer to the record of that meeting.  Speaking for the group, Mr. Hannigan stated that it was fair to say Coillte has expressed deep concern about the implications of creating this new offence and it would write to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to express its concern.  Mr. Hannigan went on to state that his organisation met senior officials from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It is a fair representation of that meeting to suggest it is also concerned about the implications.It is the view of the National Parks and Wildlife Service that section 3(2) should be referred to the Minister, the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel.  These groups have sought consultation with the Minister to ensure the legislation is thought through and such that the protection of wildlife is maximised.  The Minister has decided not to do this.  He simply seeks a unilateral ban to get his trophy legislation through before the summer.  That appears more important than anything else.  It is more important to him than animal welfare.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	295	A different approach could be taken to the protection of wildlife and the Labour Party has a very strong record in this regard.  When Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Brian O'Shea were Ministers or Ministers of State in the last Government involving the Labour Party, they made progress in respect of the Ward Union Hunt and other matters related to animal welfare.  For example, Deputy Brian O'Shea was the Minster of State who introduced the muzzling of greyhounds during coursing.  Progress was achieved but not in the divisive way the Minister is making progress now.When the issue was raised in the Dáil by Deputy Sargent in 1997, the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, referred to the Ward Union Hunt in reply to questions put.  He provided an update about how he had issued a licence which was limited to the following March.  The licence was subject to the condition that he could appoint persons to undertake monitoring of the Ward Union Hunt club.  An official from the NPWS monitored the hunt on 15 January of that year and had arranged for an official from the Department for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to undertake ongoing monitoring of the hunt until the ending of the licence.  Factual reports on the hunt were to be provided, dealing with the health and condition of the animal before and after the hunt, the treatment of the animal during the hunt, the conduct of the hunt and the impact of the hunt on the lands over which it passed.  Such monitoring led to considerable improvements which the current Minister has used when issuing licences for the hunt.When the Minister issued the most recent licence for the hunt, with 28 conditions, he was building on the work done by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  When Deputy Higgins discussed the matter in the House he indicated his wish to ensure the process of review put in place for the licensing of stag hunting would take into account all issues and viewpoints, including those adverted to by Deputies.  He listened to all sides of the House and talked to all shades of opinion on the issue in the wider community and in society.  That is a better way to approach this issue. As a result, he brought in far-reaching improvements to the licensing of the hunt.  He introduced 34 conditions, including measures to ensure the welfare of the animals would be protected through inspection by vets and to ensure the stag would be released in plenty of time to be well ahead of the dogs and so on.  The current Minister has used those conditions in the licensing of hunt.  The Labour Party approach achieved much progress.  The Ward Union Hunt bought into the process and has made major changes and improvement in the years since 1997.  This has all been based on monitoring, research and consultation with the stakeholders.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	298	There was no great uproar at that time and the Minister has implemented the conditions set down then.  It was all fine until the Minister needed a new programme for Government.  It was the first time in the history of the State there had to be a renewed programme for Government to keep a party in Government.  The contents of the programme were all about show and nothing to do with substance.  This is one such measure.Such an ill-thought out and unconsidered approach, with a lack of consultation with stakeholders from different sectors of the community and different sides, has led to unintended consequences with which the Minister must now deal.  These relate to the introduction of deer stalking provisions.  There would be no need to introduce these amendments if the deer stalking provisions had not been introduced.  There would be no need for them save the Bill had unintended consequences.  This is a direct result of the failure of the Minster to consult and bring on board the stakeholders and to ensure the legislation is thought through and based on evidence, monitoring and consultation.There is a good deal of evidence that the approach heretofore has brought about great improvements.  Departmental reports have assessed the welfare of the animals.  As it stands, the system seems to work well and the Minister could do much to build on this.  He could examine whether further conditions are needed.  He could legislate to include the conditions in the licences in law.  The Minister could examine many ways to protect the animals in this hunt but he is not prepared to do so because he wants to put through his trophy legislation.One concern raised by Wild Deer Ireland is the culling of females during May and June.  Fawns are born during these months and up until August.  The organisation maintains that legislation should restrict the culling of female deer during that season when fawns need their mothers to survive.  The Minister has done nothing about this issue because he does not care about it.  Such a measure could have emerged from consultation with the stakeholders.  It is an improvement the Minister could have introduced for the welfare of animals but he did not want to do so.  He simply sought an all-out, unilateral ban which is divisive of communities and which will have far-reaching, unintended consequences.  The Minister will do anything to get his trophy legislation.  It is the same as the case of the light bulbs, in which he ended up rowing back because he did not consult properly with the European Union.  He ended up having to legislate in a more considered and thoughtful way because the European Union made him.  I fully stand over the point that this is trophy legislation.

There are basic, practical steps the Minister can take to address the issue of the welfare of urban animals, including providing more resources to local authorities but it is certain the Minister will not do that.There are serious issues in regard to child welfare which have not been addressed by this Government, despite the all-party consensus on the need for legislation to deal with the anomalies in child welfare, statutory rape and the predatory activities of some people in regard to young people.  That legislation has not been progressed.  The reports adopted by this House have been left on the shelf by the Government.  It has done nothing to stop incineration.

We improved the welfare of stags when in Government.  That is something which can be built on in a thoughtful way.The main issue is that the Minister has not consulted the stakeholders.  There are implications for people who work in this activity.  Reports by MacMillan and Phillip have stated that 30 people could lose their jobs as a result of this ban and €1 million could be withdrawn from the local economy and that is not to mention the ancillary expenditure by participants in the hunt and the service to farmers where dead animals are picked up by people involved in the Ward Union Hunt so they will not rot in the fields and there will not be environmental hazards.  Will that ancillary activity of the Ward Union Hunt survive if this unilateral ban is put in place without any consultation with the stakeholders and any consideration of the consequences?  Whatever the Minister does, he should ensure there are not unintended consequences that will damage animal welfare, divide communities or result in people losing their jobs.Many jockeys have said it will undermine their capacity to develop riding skills.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The Ward Union Hunt was established in 1854.  It has been in existence for more than 100 years but the Minister is unilaterally getting rid of it.  Prior to the renewed programme for Government, his approach was the same as the Labour Party's, that is, to try to make improvements through licensing conditions.  At the very least, the Minister should have had stakeholder consultation and involvement in this process but he was not prepared to do that.  If he had that process, he could have looked at the implications.Other Governments have done things on a cross-party basis.  They have studied the issue, looked at the economic impact and sent veterinarians to inspect the animals.  They have tried to take a thoughtful approach but the Minister was not prepared to do that.It basically goes back to the fact that the Green Party has very little to offer in Government.  It has implemented few of the promises it made before the general election——

It needed a renewed programme for Government because it could not implement the original one.   It had to come up with something a bit like the light bulbs.  It decided to have a trophy to show it was making progress when it was really making no progress at all.  That is cynical on the Minister's part and it is not the way to approach things.  He could bring on board all sides on this, as others have done.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I respect the views of others on this issue.  There are strongly held views on both sides of this argument.  The Labour Party has a strong record of opposing animal cruelty.  Indeed, we had a campaign on that issue in the 1992-93 period.  It is from that period that the oft quoted remark from me on stag hunting was made.  That was a correct position at that time.Arising from that position, we achieved major improvements in all the legal sports where one animal was set against another with the object and purpose of a kill.  The kill was eliminated from all of these sports arising from the regulations introduced by two Labour Party Ministers, Deputies Higgins and O'Shea.Deputy O'Shea introduced the use of muzzles which prevented hounds in pursuit of hares from killing hares.  That was a major improvement.  Hounds on racecourses in Harold's Cross, Newbridge and elsewhere are muzzled in case they attack each other.  Deputy Higgins introduced regulations concerning the Ward Union Hunt which prevented the hounds from making any contact with the deer.  The regulations are monitored by Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food inspectors.  The animal is examined by veterinarians before and after the hunt and, by all accounts, is well catered for in between hunts.The regulations introduced by Deputy Higgins allowed a period of time — I believe it is a half an hour — between the release of the deer and the release of the hounds.  They also require that the hounds must be called off if they come within a certain distance of the deer.  That ensured that the two legal sports in Ireland, the purpose of which was set animals against each other with the purpose of a kill, were no longer a legal activity.  That is now the case as a direct result of the Labour Party's action in government with Fianna Fáil.  There was agreement across the House on the measures brought in.  There is now no legal activity in which one animal is set against another with the object of killing one another, which is a major achievement.It is now limited to race and chase with no possibility of a kill.  That was the object of the exercise of the Labour Party and the basis of the statement by the Minister and others, who now want to opt for the draconian all-out, end of story measures proposed in this Bill.Our spokesperson, Deputy Tuffy, has outlined the Labour Party's position and the reasons it will vote against this Bill which, as she said, is essentially a piece of trophy legislation promised by Fianna Fáil to the Green Party in order to provide it with some cover for having got so little from this Government.  Many in Fianna Fáil are opposed to the measure but their mettle will be tested next week when we vote on this Bill.There are many other urgent animal welfare issues the Minister is ignoring, such as the growing problem of abandoned horses in urban areas, to which my colleague referred.  Some 350 horses were abandoned in Dublin alone last year but no action was taken by the Minister in that regard.If this was only about the Ward Union Hunt, there would perhaps be only local interest.  There certainly would not be the level of interest that surrounds the debate.  The reason for the level of interest in and strong opposition to this measure is that the cat was let out of the bag on Pat Kenny's television programme and on Kildare FM by those campaigning for this measure.  On both occasions, members and spokespersons for the Irish Council Against Blood Sports made it clear that this measure to ban the Ward Union Hunt was only the thin end of the wedge and that they had a much wider agenda which they would pursue.  All levels of hunting of foxes, hare and deer would be banned if they got their way, regardless of the built-in safety regulations.On my local radio station, Kildare FM, a senior spokesperson stated that fishing other than for food was cruel and should be banned and that there should be no more catch and release and no more course fishing.  Shooting had no chance of being tolerated and horse-racing was also in their sights.

That is the reason so many people have come out against this measure.  I will not support that agenda.  The most serious act against wildlife in this country was the release into the wild of thousands of farmed mink.  Those supporting this Bill and the wider agenda to which I have referred boasted that they were responsible for this dastardly act.  Mink have spread to all parts of the island.  They have decimated wildlife, wiping out rabbits and water fowl in many areas, and they have attacked domestic animals and fowl.  The people who committed this dastardly act and those associated with them did more damage to wildlife than 100 Ward Unions would have done.During a recent debate in the House, Deputy Thomas Byrne attacked and denigrated Senator Dominic Hannigan because the Labour Party had not at that time made a decision on its position on this measure.  The parliamentary party discusses issues and arrives at a decision, which we then implement.  The decision was made recently following the publication of this Bill and the public debate on it.  The Labour Party has examined the Bill and reached a decision to vote against it.  Senator Hannigan will vote accordingly in the Seanad.  I hope Deputy Byrne will also vote against this measure in accordance with his publicly expressed position.I was born and reared on a small farm in County Mayo.  We snared rabbits for food and for sale.  It was not a kind way of catching them but it was the only way available to us.  We destroyed vermin and we collected the State bounties for doing so, which gave us pocket money.  We respected our environment and we protected it as best we could.  After all, we lived off the land and what it produced and we had an interest in doing so.  I will not accept any criticism of my commitment to animal welfare or the record of the Labour Party in this regard.Bloodsports do not exist legally in Ireland unless one wants to count shooting and fishing, which are on the Minister's agenda.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I wish to share time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.I ask everyone to reflect on what we are trying to achieve with this legislation.  This is not a simplistic issue and its deep implications need to be highlighted and debated.  The Bill was published on 20 April.  It has been suggested that stag hunting should cease for animal welfare and public safety reasons and I want to challenge this rationale.  I also want to challenge both the alleged concerns about animal welfare and the exaggerated claims pertaining to public safety.The Bill will give legislative effect to the commitment in the renewed programme for Government with the Green Party to ban the practice of stag hunting.  While the Minister advises that this will not have implications for other country pursuits, the resulting effect of the Bill will be devastating to my home county of Meath and the only remaining stag hunt in the country, the Ward Union Hunt, WUH.  While there are strong opinions on both sides, I have deep reservations about this legislation.The legislation will significantly impact on the livelihoods of people in my community.  Thousands of people have signed a petition opposing the proposal to ban stag hunting.  This petition represents the voices of rural Ireland.  These are the voices of people who understand the devastating effect that the Bill will have and who have a real connection with animal welfare.  They are not involved because of a political ideology but because they deal with animals on a day-to-day basis.  These are the voices of people who know and understand the realities of our natural world.The Bill jeopardises long held traditions, the rural economy of Meath and the future of the horse racing industry.  I live on the Fairyhouse Road, Ratoath, next to the Tattersalls Ireland complex and down the road from the WUH kennels.  The Tattersalls complex is Ireland's largest bloodstock sales arena and major auctions take place throughout the year with people travelling from all over the world.  This is the home of the WUH.  Ratoath is steeped in the history of the horse racing industry and hunting.  These two sports go hand in hand with each other.  The connection between racing and hunting is a key contributor to Ireland's reputation as world leader in horse breeding.  For the past 162 years, the two sports have benefited from each other in County Meath, as have Fairyhouse racecourse, Tattersalls and the WUH in their interaction with each other.The hunt was established in 1854.  It maintains a 150-strong herd of native Irish red deer in its reservation at Greenpark, Dunshaughlin, County Meath.  The hunt has more than 200 members, employs four full-time staff and contributes €1.4 million to the local economy.  It costs approximately €6,700 per annum to keep a horse.  That money is spent in my local area, benefiting vets, farriers, feed merchants and saddlers.  The WUH founded Fairyhouse racecourse and the first point to point meeting was held there in 1848.  The link between the hunt and the racecourse is still present.  WUH officials lead in the Irish Grand National winner.  For decades, Fairyhouse was effectively managed in a large measure by many hunt members.  The past two chairmen of the hunt were on the board of Fairyhouse racecourse.The WUH has for a long time been a nurturing ground for many of Ireland's top jockeys.  These jockeys live in my parish.  Current active members of the WUH include Grand National winning jockeys Paul Carberry, Robert Power, Barry Geraghty, Ross Geraghty, Grand National winning trainer Gordon Elliott and champion lady rider Nina Carberry.  Distinguished flat jockey, Kevin Manning, also grew up hunting with the WUH.  They all developed their riding skills on hunts with the WUH.  Ruby Walsh has also been involved.  Paul Carberry, Barry Geraghty and Nina Carberry are all outstanding sports people who have said that the ban on stag hunting would undermine their capacity to practice and develop their riding skills.  As the history of the WUH has demonstrated, today's young riders are the great jockeys of horse racing tomorrow.  The WUH has played and continues to play a significant role in the success of the horse racing industry.The chief executive officer of Horse Racing Ireland, Brian Kavanagh, recently said:"In no other sport can Ireland claim such an elite Ievel of achievement.  Horse racing and breeding is one of the few industries in which Ireland is rightly recognised as a world leader, due to its indigenous skills base and the tradition of enlightened government policy.  This has generated positive benefits for Ireland in economic terms."Irish trained horses occupy three of the top four places in the world thoroughbred rankings, including world champion Sea the Stars.The Dukes report published in late 2009 was commissioned by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and it highlighted how the racing industry has become a significant employer with 15,500 jobs, excluding the betting industry, and it is a vital part of the struggling rural economy.  However, this position in severe danger.  The industry suffered an estimated 1,500 job losses in 2009.  The report made clear that the industry provides vital employment in rural Ireland but that this is under threat.  The ban on stag hunting will not only be detrimental to the local jobs and the local economy in Meath, but it also poses a threat to the wider economy.  Why are the thousands of voices that oppose this ban being ignored?  I cannot understand why that is.  It is wrong to trample on people's rural traditions.We must consider some key facts to get a picture of the significant contribution played by the horse racing industry to the economy .  The gross value of the industry to the economy is in excess of €1.1 billion per annum.  In 2009, a total of 6,222 Irish thoroughbreds to the value of €216 million were exported to 42 countries.  Many of these were sold in the Tattersalls complex on the road on which I live.  The industry generates significant benefits for the tourism industry, with approximately 80,000 visiting Ireland for race meetings, sales and stud operations.  Many of them stay in homes, bed and breakfasts and guest houses in my community.  The value of racing festivals and other meetings to local economies is estimated to be €260 million.  This has a major impact on rural communities.Ireland has more race tracks per head of population than any other country in the world.  There are 27 race tracks in Ireland, with an average of 340 race meetings per annum.  Apart from the fact that interest in racing is high, Ireland is one of the few countries which has national hunt racing all year round.  This explains the high number of tracks.  According to Horse Racing Ireland, in 2009 there was a severe decline in bloodstock sales at public auctions, such as the auction on my road, with sales falling by 32% to €67.5 million.  The number of stallions, mares and foals fell significantly, reflecting an Irish horse-breeding industry that is now under threat.  Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  These industries directly account for approximately 27,500 jobs.  A recent review of the fund found that horse racing in Ireland was "a key driver of substantial economic activity, especially in rural areas."As recent reports have outlined, the Irish breeding industry is already under threat, and the Bill before us today poses another significant threat to the horse racing industry and the rural economy in which I live.  The ban on stag hunting will result in further job losses in rural Ireland, but most of all, it will have a disproportionate effect on a single group of extremely important hunters, the Ward Union Hunt.In times of such economic difficulty it does not make sense to jeopardise jobs, the rural economy, the horse racing industry and the wider economy.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	354	As I have outlined today, County Meath plays a significant role in hunting and horse racing in Ireland.  This ban will have repercussions for more than the Ward Union Hunt and its 200 members.The proponents of this Bill have cited animal welfare and public safety as being the driving force behind the bill.  I simply do not agree that this Bill is needed for animal welfare and public safety reasons.  I have been to visit the kennels, as has the Acting Chairman, Deputy Johnny Brady.  I might elaborate on that if I have time.Stag hunting involves the separation of a deer from the herd and its transportation to a location from where it is released and hunted.  It was devised 200 years ago to allow hunts to take place when wild deer became too scarce.  Red deer are bred and maintained for this purpose by the Ward Union Hunt.  Let us be clear on what actually happens.  On a hunting day a stag is released, recaptured and returned safe and sound to the Ward Union Hunt farm.  Each stag in the herd is hunted just once a year, with constant supervision by wildlife officers and veterinarians from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This is a fact.  The health of the stag is checked before and after a hunt and continual monitoring has shown no excess stress levels.The use of road whips and road marshals has been established in the time since this Government came to power.  They were introduced when issues arose with the 1997 licence.  I remember working with the Ward Union Hunt at that time, and there was much interaction between the hunt and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  The hunt introduced a team of road marshals to minimise disruption and sought meeting locations with off-road parking.  Persons were appointed to proceed along the roads and control the hounds, employing two-way radios for communication.  In addition, the number of people allowed to hunt on one day was reduced in order to reduce the impact of the hunt.  All of this required the implementation of a balloting system for members.The hunt introduced many conditions from 1997 onwards to try to alleviate concerns to do with the licence application.  The road whips and road marshals play an important role in the Ward Union Hunt as they work to ensure the safety of the public and the well-being of the stag, hounds and horses.  They are in constant contact with the huntsman to ensure they know exactly where the stag is and the direction in which he is heading.The Ward Union Hunt has an exemplary record in managing its herd of pure-bred Irish red deer, making it a unique ecological asset.  If the ban proceeds, that entire heritage will be lost.  I ask those who are genuinely interested in our natural heritage to consider this.  The hunt has already introduced a number of regulations to ensure the highest animal welfare standards and has implemented a wide range of health and safety measures.  Banning the hunt in order to address concerns over public safety and animal welfare is an excessive and unfair response, especially if other measures can be found to address these concerns.  I repeat that the Ward Union Hunt is willing to engage with a view to exploring further possible health and safety measures.  In that context, is a ban a proportionate response?Over recent years, each hunt conducted by the Ward Union Hunt has been closely monitored by Government inspectors, and their reports have consistently not identified animal welfare issues.  In addition, veterinarians from the then Department of Agriculture and Food conducted a major study of every deer hunted during the 1997-98 season and reported that the health of the deer did not appear to be affected in either the short or the long term after hunting.  These are the facts.  Hunting is not cruel to the deer and it is closely monitored by Government inspectors to ensure that this is so.I question the use of animal welfare and public safety as a motivation for this legislation and have legitimate suspicions that the real agenda is a basic dislike of all forms of hunting and rural activities, which is informed by ideology rather than reality.  The reality is so different, and I would love to see people experiencing the real hunt.Let us further consider the alleged animal welfare concerns.  An example of the Ward Union Hunt's commitment to the highest standards of animal welfare is its valuable service of a subsidised collection facility for the fallen stock of local farmers.  The Ward Union Hunt has two specially equipped vehicles licensed by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for collections from farmers on a daily basis.  Veterinary inspectors from the Department call to the Ward Union Hunt facility at the end of every day to examine and take samples from animals.  Laboratory testing is then carried out on these samples to ensure prevention and early detection of bovine diseases such as BSE, and the facilities are audited annually.  It processes around 4,500 cattle per annum, along with a large number of sheep.  The Ward Union Hunt would not be able to provide this essential service unless it operated to the highest hygiene and environmental standards.  The collection service is vital to the business of farmers in the area and also provides an important database to the Department on the movement of cattle.  In view of this, who is it that really cares about animal welfare?  There are positive actions being taken to support animal welfare around the Ward Union Hunt farm and kennels.I emphasise that Ward Union Hunt hunts have been regularly monitored by Government inspectors and that animal welfare issues have not being identified.  Proponents of the Bill are using emotive and incorrect sound bites to conceal their ideological objection to hunting and rural pastimes.  It is also clear that there has been insufficient engagement with key stakeholders — the people who really do care about animal welfare.This Bill and its impact on the rural community that I represent should not be exploited by anybody on any side of the House for cheap political gain.  For me and for those I represent, it is too important.  The Minister must be able to see that this Bill does not have the support of rural Ireland.  The sheer number of people around the country involved in the Rural Ireland Says Enough campaign is evidence of this fact.  A number of local authorities around the country have declared their support for the RISE campaign, including Meath County Council.The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill will affect jobs.  It will affect the local economy in Meath.

The legislation is supposed to be motivated by public safety and animal welfare concerns but is actually motivated by an ideology that is removed from reality.  By its very existence it casts a smear on decent people who pursue traditions and pastimes that are fundamental to who we are — people who have a proven track record in both animal welfare and public safety and who have not been consulted in this process.The Bill is unnecessary and has a disproportionate effect on the economy of County Meath and the Ward Union Hunt.  The Ward Union Hunt has maintained the highest animal welfare standards through its 200-year history.  It has also made an outstanding contribution to the Irish horse racing industry and should be allowed to continue to do so.  We must consider the implications for the people I represent in my home community.  What would have been so wrong with granting another licence for next season from October to March?  We could have come back here in September and had a much more detailed debate.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	363	That is fine.Before we progress any further with this Bill, I would like to invite the Minister, and anyone else who is interested, to come to Meath, as other Deputies have done, and join me on a Ward Union hunt day.  People need to see for themselves what this is about.  I mean this invitation with all my heart.  People can see for themselves how important it is to the people involved.  I have no doubt the Minister would be greatly impressed by how humanely the animals are treated and how much care, attention and effort is put into looking after those animals.What was really fascinating that day and it is something the people do not seem to realise, is that the deer and the hounds live together in the same yard.  When the deer was put into the trailer in our presence, one would imagine he would have been fretting or worried or concerned because of the heavy barking of the hounds who were being gathered up in the yard beside him but he passed no remarks on them.  Why did he pass no remarks?  It is because he lives with them and beside them every day.  This idea of the deer being all in a sweat in the trailer is simply not the reality.The Minister would be pleasantly surprised as indeed were we.  I am a lifelong supporter of the Ward Union Hunt but I had not been to its kennels until this year in company with the Deputies from the area.  We visited the kennels before we discussed this Bill and decided to speak on it.  We were pleasantly surprised and I know the Minister would be pleasantly surprised with what he would see in the Ward Union Hunt kennels.  The hunt is a traditional rural pursuit and it is not as one might perceive it.  It is a significant employer and is a contributor to the culture of rural Ireland and it has a very important place in my community.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	364	As a member of the Government party I should have my hands around my two Green Party colleagues here but, unfortunately, this is not the case.  I am not happy either.  The Minister knows this and so does his colleague, the former Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  I have had many debates with my colleague in government and I hope to have some more during the passage of upcoming Bills but in my view, any legislation passed by this House should be assessed by means of an impact assessment study to assess the detrimental or otherwise effects on any person or community.  This has not happened in the case of this Bill.  There has not been proper consultation.  Will there be a Bill to protect the ordinary, decent people referred to by the previous speaker and other speakers?  They are having sleepless nights and are being terrorised.  I have said this to Deputy Sargent on another occasion.  People are being victimised and pilloried and held up as being wild men or wild animals themselves, which is shameful.  It is time for some common sense.The Minister is a reasonable man as are most of his colleagues in the House and I have said to him in the past that this policy and legislation are being driven by unreasonable people.  I will not say anything stronger today although I could.  These people are not being fair to the decent, plain people of Ireland.  It has been noted that this stag hunt has been in existence since 1854 and reference has been made to its benefits.  People who take part in rural pursuits and who get their children involved will care for animals more than any animal rights person or self-proclaimed animal rights people because they are close to nature.  They understand nature and they are familiar with farming practices and respect them and the farming communities.  I acknowledge there was an horrific incident involving a deer in a school yard which is not desirable.I refer to the explanatory memorandum of the Bill which states:Section 3 provides for a new provision making it an offence to hunt deer using two or more dogs.  This provision includes the hunting of deer by any holder of an appropriate hunting licence or permission granted under the Wildlife Acts.  For the purposes of this section deer includes deer that are not wild animals. It shall not make it an offence where the person has been granted permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to use dogs to drive deer off land where they are causing serious damage to tree plantations or crops.That is lunacy.  I was reared on a farm and so was the Acting Chairman, Deputy Johnny Brady.  I ask my learned colleagues to come and visit the farms.  I know Deputy Sargent has visited farms.  Nobody can drive any animal, whether wild or tame, off land as this section suggests.  I had big problems in my area with wild deer and I have been in touch with the Minister's Department on a regular basis to see what can be done to help farmers.  Deer are already running by themselves so it is very dangerous to run them.  They run and knock fences, even electric fences and they run onto roadways.  Deer can do great damage to vehicles.  This Bill provides for the use of dogs to drive deer off land.  The people who drafted this Bill do not understand the situation and that is the basis of our problem.  This is why I am so exercised about it.  I am disappointed it forms part of the programme for Government.  I am shocked to think that one of our negotiators is a constituency colleague of Deputy Wallace and Deputy Brady.  He should know about stag hunting.  I know nothing about stag hunting because I do not live in that part of the country so I will not stray into it.  However, I am disappointed in the way they have been vilified.Nothing has been said about the fallen animals scheme and the good practices carried out by the hunt people on behalf of the community.  When a member of the Garda Síochána is called to an accident involving, for example, a horse injured on the road in Dublin or wherever, a vet will come to treat the animal and put it down.  He will then telephone the Ward Union Hunt and within 15 or 20 minutes, they will be on the scene to provide a fallen animal service.  Who will provide this service, who will take up the slack?A lot of good work is being undermined in this Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider why people are thinking this is the thin end of the wedge.  This is why the RISE! people who are coming up here this evening to lobby us, are worried.  It is farcical to talk about public safety when the Bill provides that deer can be driven off land with dogs, into other land or into forestry or onto roads.  This is not ensuring public safety.  We are putting the cart before the horse.I ask the Minister — with regard to another Bill due before the House — to honour a commitment he made in writing to his Cabinet colleagues in 2008.  If that commitment in writing cannot be honoured here by a Minister, can any spoken commitment be believed?  I ask him to think of the ordinary, plain people of Ireland who want to continue carrying out practices that have been in existence since old God's time.  The Green Party is relatively new.  It is in government with us and we have a good relationship.  I met the Minister at a conference in the Glen of Aherlow.  I would welcome him down again and we could take a walk into the woods and see nature at its best——

The first shots in the next general election are being fired here this evening.  Deputy Wallace and Deputy Mattie McGrath, among others on the Fianna Fáil backbenches, will have their opportunity here on Tuesday evening to vote against this Bill and I hope they will do so in the interests of rural Ireland.  I advise them not to be hypocrites.  If they do not vote against this Bill, they will be seen as the greatest hypocrites this country has ever seen.  I will be watching their performance here on Tuesday evening.I was watching the Minister during the contributions from Deputy Wallace and Deputy Mattie McGrath.  While he continually interrupted Deputy Phil Hogan, Deputy Emmet Stagg and Deputy Joanna Tuffy, all he could do was to look back over his shoulder at Deputy Wallace in particular, with his mouth wide open in a state of shock.  It shows how little thought was put into this Bill by the Minister and into the interests of the people of rural Ireland.I emphasise that I am totally opposed to this legislation, as a representative of Longford-Westmeath and as a countryman who supports the rural pursuits and unique heritage and tradition of field sports.  While saying this, I have also spent my life caring for animals and likewise I oppose any cruelty to them whatsoever.  However, there are ways of ensuring animal safety and indeed, human safety, other than those proposed in this legislation.  In what can only be seen as totally appropriate, an English newspaper yesterday contained the headline, "Yes, It's Gormley Again".  While this piece of journalistic endeavour did not refer to the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the sentiment fully endorses the feelings of rural Ireland.  The people of rural Ireland and urban Ireland are very angry with the way he has behaved since he became Minister.    The Minister's name is synonymous with an increasing number of initiatives that have brought heartache and economic fall-out to rural and urban areas.   Unfortunately, this legislation is a continuation of that trend.  No matter which way we look at it, this Bill is rural legislation being imposed by an urban-based Minister who, with all respects, does not have a rural heritage.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I know that well.  The Minister is interrupting me.  Why did he not interrupt the two previous speakers?What the Minister fails to acknowledge is that hunting creates a sense of community in rural areas.  My farm has facilitated hunting throughout my life and both my father and grandfather before him allowed the hunts to pass through our lands.  I will continue to allow them do so.  Hunting unites farmers and sports people for a common recreational purpose and tradition.I am deeply concerned at the appalling actions of the Minister and his wilting Green Party, which are aimed at destroying countrywide field sports.  The fact this Bill could be the opening salvo in a stealth attack on all field sports is of deep concern to me and my constituents in the midlands.  Were there to be restrictions on other areas of country life, recreation and rural tourism, the rural population would suffer extreme hardship and unemployment and rural depopulation would escalate.I should, of course, be relaxed and at ease about the threat to field sports, as I got the Minster's assurance that they are not at risk in reply to an Adjournment matter I tabled last April.  The Minster stated then:Last year, the Government approved the drafting of legislation to prohibit the hunting of deer by a pack of hounds.  I want to make it clear that this legislation will not have any implications for other country pursuits such as fox hunting, hare coursing or deer stalking.  Hunting with harriers and beagles will still be permitted and, therefore, foxhound, harrier and beagle hunting associations in the State can continue to operate as before as this legislation will not impact on them.However, my trust in this is upset by a picture in my mind of the Minister with his fingers crossed behind his back, saying "Not yet anyway", under his breath.I cannot help but think of the way the Minister and the Government sold out the turf-cutters in the midlands and throughout the country.  How did his heritage brief come into the reckoning when he was destroying centuries of tradition?  The Minister must refuse to put EU directives ahead of the welfare of rural turf cutters.  Turf cutting is a skill that has passed from fathers to sons and daughters and is a community activity that fosters pride in a locality.  Those involved are keenly aware of environmental issues and co-operate with local authorities in ensuring that bogs are kept waste free by removing domestic waste and other illegal dumping.  Turf cutting is part of our culture and tradition.  As such it faces the encroaching globalisation that is stripping us of our unique heritage.  No compensation could make good the loss of the tradition of generations.This is not to say that environmental considerations can be overlooked.  The survival of our unique flora and fauna must be balanced against turbary rights.  However, the Minister presided over the greatest assault on the rights of domestic turf cutters to the detriment of rural people, leaving a bitterness he has ignored but that will return to haunt him at the next election.  This is a serious concern considering the 16,000 people on the live register in Longford-Westmeath and the 439,100 unemployed throughout the country.  As the Minister pursues his blinkered course, more and more jobs will slip through the Government's fingers.  While the initial target of the ban is stag hunting, groups such as anglers see the ban as a prelude to a wider and more aggressive so-called green agenda in the future.  An eel farmer was recently put out of business in Westmeath.  This ban could be the end of countryside recreation as we know it and another blow to our already hard hit tourism industry.Perhaps this Bill is part of the syndrome that sees the Government wasting money the country does not have on frog and bat surveys.  While the bats may be deserting the belfries, the Government is taking their place.  Important legislation that will have a positive impact on this country is being deferred every day in the House, but the Minister thinks it is important to waste time and resources to highlight this narrow green driven agenda, at the expense of solving economic and social problems. Neither I nor Fine Gael share his misguided ideas.  Rural Ireland is under threat and our traditional way of life faces destruction.  Through the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010, the Green Party, which is an urban based party, essentially puts a ban on our rural way of life, rural tradition, tourism and the rural economy.Following this legislation, the anti-puppy farming Bill will see the Minister break another promise.  That Bill will turn into an anti- kennel and anti-greyhound Bill.  Before the Minister rushes headlong into creating more devastation in this sector, he should consider the fact that greyhound coursing and racing support 11,000 jobs and add €500 million each year to our economy.  Deputy Wallace was right on that.  The Bill will have a devastating effect on jobs if it is allowed go ahead.  While €500 million may appear small change to a Government which thinks nothing of throwing €22 billion of taxpayers' money into the gutter, the revenue generated is extremely important to hard pressed rural communities.The Minister's extraordinarily blinkered approach to the banning of deer hunting by stags has led him to remove the provision from the Animal Health and Welfare Bill and introduce it as stand-alone legislation, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010.  This strikes me as unnecessary point scoring and an outright attack on those who have protested against the legislation in any form.  It reinforces the Government system of democracy by numbers.  As I said previously in the House, I was shocked to see on the Minister's website the no-holes-barred assertion that the Green Party intended to attack coursing and fox hunting and secure a legislative ban on all blood sports.  As in most things, we know there is no consensus with the Green Party's partner in Government, Fianna Fáil.  In April, the Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, said there was no Government proposal or Bill to ban stag hunting.  How wrong he was.Research indicates that hunting had an economic value of €111.6 million in 2007, but the Minister must not have noted this.  This value is broken down as follows: game shooting, €41.7 million; hunting with hounds, €34.2 million; coursing, €26.2 million; deer shooting, €8.9 million; and falconry, €0.6 million.I cannot emphasise strongly enough the devastation to the sporting, economic, leisure and tourism activities of any ban on field sports, hare coursing or stag hunting.  Any such move would be detrimental to the country as a whole and to the countryside in particular.The voices of the 300,000 field sports members have been loud in opposition to this Bill.  Banning hunting, which is a strong tradition in rural Ireland going back centuries and over many generations, would be a threat to the rural way of life and would be strongly resisted by rural people and by people living in towns who participate in rural sports, many of whom I am delighted to welcome onto my farm every spring.  Deer and fox hunting have had a long history in this country since the 19th century and earlier.  The Ward Union Hunt, which is the only licensed stag hunt in the country, covers areas of north County Dublin, together with the south and east of County Meath.  I note this is Deputy Wallace's constituency and I wonder whether she would have been so voluble on this issue had it not affected part of her constituency.  I hope so, in the interests of country pursuits.  The hunt maintains its own herd of 150 red deer.  The stags are not generally killed but are recaptured and returned to the herd.  Each stag is checked before and after the hunt and its stress levels recorded.  Moreover, each stag is hunted only once a year and is checked by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's wildlife officers and veterinarians.  The Ward Union Hunt has 200 members and contributes €1.4 million to €1.5 million to the economy each year.As there are 27,000 members of the National Association of Regional Game Councils who are organised in 926 clubs, the Minister can assess the impact of any attempt to curtail or prohibit field sports of this nature.  My constituency of Longford-Westmeath contains 2,000 members of the National Association of Regional Game Councils, 800 of whom are affiliated to the Longford Shooting and Conservation Council and 1,200 of whom are affiliated to the Westmeath Regional Game Council.  I ask the Minister to consider the implications of this ill-considered threat to the Ward Union's carted stag hunt and field sports.  I do not know what he hopes to gain from the interference in a well-regulated sporting sector.  However, I am aware of the great losses that would be incurred by sporting organisations, tourism groups and the economy.Ironically, the greatest loss could be to the Minister himself and to his Government, which has presided over the rape of the countryside.  The Minister, Deputy John Gormley, who I am pleased to note has returned to the Chamber, is pushing a narrow Green Party agenda and is merely attempting to cover up the failed record of his party in Government.  This has included protecting bankers over citizens by virtue of a banking bailout of €73 billion that even Professor Patrick Honohan has argued was too broad.  As I noted previously, last week it emerged that €22 billion has been wasted in the toxic Anglo Irish Bank.  I also refer to the Government's failure to take early and decisive action in the budget in 2008 and the Minister's complete lack of a job strategy at a time of record unemployment when almost 450,000 people are out of work.Moreover, the Minister is delaying investigations into the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to protect his partners in Government, namely, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and associates.  The Government's failures also include slashing allowances for the blind, those with disabilities and children, as well as taking medical cards from the elderly.  In addition, last year the Minister voted in the Dáil in support of Deputies Willie O'Dea and Bertie Ahern and the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney.  He has helped to vote down all attempts to hold the three outstanding by-elections.  He has overseen a water system that is not fit for purpose and which acts as a drag on the economy.  He literally was asleep during the night of the bank guarantee scheme.  I hope the Minister is not sleeping here today, as I notice he is nodding a little.  He has engaged in a campaign against rural Ireland to appease his own narrow base of supporters.  These are all factors that will militate against the Minister.The Government has destroyed the farming sector and has left rural areas without viable infrastructure, transport, health and educational facilities.  Lack of funding and lack of support has left farmers at the mercy of directives, which have consumed their meagre resources, etc.

It was a wonderful rural incentive to clean up the community and to help farmers to deal with problems arising in the countryside.  The Government has decimated this great scheme and I am surprised the Minister was not more voluble on this issue.  He has let people down badly in this regard.  Furthermore, in an action that hit small householders and young farmers, etc., installation aid for young farmers has been done away with.  The Government has literally destroyed this country.As I noted earlier, the revolt is under way.  I overheard Deputy Mattie McGrath state earlier that he is highly disappointed with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is from the same county as Deputy Wallace.  I can see the Fianna Fáil backbenchers lining up in the Chamber and I hope that on Tuesday, they will enter the lobbies with the Opposition parties to oppose this legislation.  Were they to so do, they would do their country some justice.

Many people are highly concerned about this Bill and are fearful for the many other rural pursuits that are practised and engaged in.  This legislation is being perceived as an attack that will lead to a ban on all field sports.  The organisations opposed to the Bill represent more than 300,000 people involved in country pursuits.  Rural field sports are family-orientated activities that are not ageist, sexist or racist.  Generations of Irish people have taken part in such healthy, outdoor and family activities.  Rural sports are an important economic activity in many rural communities and provide important support to the farming and bloodstock industry.  As a rural Deputy, I represent an area in which there are two hunt clubs on my doorstep, namely, the Ballymacad Hunt and the Meath Hunt.  I know exactly how important both these hunts are to the local community.  They have major support across a broad area.  Foxhunting nationally is a major contributor to the economy in the absence of any State support.The Government has decided that stag hunting should cease for animal welfare and public safety reasons.  The purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the commitment in the renewed programme for Government to ban the practice of stag hunting with a pack of hounds.  I call on the Minister to conduct a full regulatory impact assessment before proceeding with this Bill and to consult further with all stakeholders.  A ban on the Ward Union Hunt will remove €1.4 million in spending power annually from the north-east region.  A similar ban or restriction on other field sports would reduce spending power nationally by well over €100 million.Hunting is part of the bedrock foundation of the €1.1 billion thoroughbred racing business.  Each year, 80,000 visitors come to this country to take part in or watch equestrian sports and they spend an estimated €53.9 million.  Deer hunting is closely monitored by Government inspectors.  It operates under the terms of a strict licensing, inspection and monitoring system imposed by the Minister.Hunts make a vital contribution to farming by providing farmers with a fallen animal collection service on a daily basis.  Dead cattle and sheep are disposed of through this service.  Without it there are risks in terms of animal disease control and to animal husbandry.  Farming costs will increase as a result of the ban.  What alternatives will be put in place by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to facilitate a cost-effective fallen animal collection service and on-site post mortem facilities?  The prompt and secure removal and appropriate disposal of fallen stock is essential to mitigating the potential effect such carcases might have on human, animal and environmental health.  What is a farmer to do with a dead carcass on the farm?  In most cases farmers wish to know what caused the death of a cow, sheep or other animal and they call their local vet to carry out a post mortem examination on the carcass.  By law, this cannot be done on the farm and must be carried out only after the Enfer BSE test shows a negative result.  The test is carried out at the Ward Union Hunt kennels.I am not happy, despite the assertion of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, that the legislation will not have any implications for other country pursuits such as fox hunting, hare hunting, hare coursing, shooting, fishing, greyhound racing or deer stalking.  I consider the Bill to be an assault on rural Ireland and its traditions.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I did not interrupt other speakers.  This afternoon I find myself wavering along a very fine dividing line.  I plead with the Minister to think again on the issue.  Rural Ireland is rightly concerned and annoyed about the devastating impacts for employment in farming and for rural traditions.  It is not realistic to focus on no more than three incidents that occurred out of more than 400 hunts conducted in the past ten years.  That is particularly so when no account is being taken of the number of deer that are injured or killed on roads and in the Phoenix Park.  Is that not a much more serious public safety issue?  Banning a hunt in order to address concerns over public safety is an over-reaction.I stress the major importance and significance of all rural pursuits and the benefits that accrue from them to rural Ireland.  I plead for more time and consultation for this debate.  I call on the Minister to conduct a full regulatory impact assessment and to consult further with all stakeholders.  I had a different view on the Ward Union Hunt following the occurrence of certain incidents, especially the Kildalkey incident.  Deputy Wallace outlined the visit to the kennels which led me to reassess my view.  Those involved in the Ward Union kennels have put safety measures in place since that incident.  Animal welfare is No. 1 on its list.  I compliment the kennels on the measures that were put in place, which were explained in detail to us.  Those involved showed us the hounds and the deer.  The animal welfare in the kennels is first class.In the context of cruelty to animals, will the Minister indicate what will happen to the beautiful pack of hounds that are in the Ward Union kennels?

Likewise, what will happen to the deer, of which here are 150?  As Deputy Mattie McGrath said, we all have deer roaming free in our area.  Will the gates be opened and those 150 deer let loose?  Is it right to bring someone in to put them down?  I do not think so.I was the first person to speak on the issue at our parliamentary party meeting following the agreement of the programme for Government.  I was concerned.  I did not know much about the Ward Union Hunt because it is not exactly in my area.  However, I know enough about fox hunting and the Ballymacad Hunt and the Meath Hunt.  I follow them whenever I am at home, especially around Christmas time.  I get great enjoyment from them.  I got a commitment from the Taoiseach that evening that nothing else would be affected.  That is why, like many of my colleagues, I agreed to the programme for Government.I say to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to the Taoiseach and other members of the Government, that if any of the other country pursuits such as fox hunting——

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	392	Nuair atáimid ag caint faoi bheith ag fiach nó ag seilg, táimid ag caint faoi stair agus oidhreacht na hÉireann.  Ó aimsir Fionn Mac Cumhaill agus Diarmuid agus Gráinne, tá muintir na hÉireann ag seilg le haghaidh spraoi, bia agus maireachtáil.  The old Irish words for hunting — "seilg" and "fiach" — are all the evidence one needs to show that this is an ancient Irish pastime.  No translated words from the English, German or Latin languages are required to explain something about this country that has existed for so long.  That is the most important point; that hunting must be recognised.  In the United Kingdom it has become a class issue.  It is not a class issue in this country and it should never be allowed to become one.The people I represent in East Meath are by and large strongly opposed to the legislation.  Farmers are opposed to it, in particular because of the services for fallen animals that the Ward Union Hunt provides and because of the enjoyment they have during the winter watching the hunt passing through their lands.  The community itself enjoys the hunt and it binds them together.  The racing community is opposed to the Bill because of the economic benefits attached to the hunt.  There are four racecourses in County Meath in Laytown, Bellewstown, Navan and Fairyhouse.  The Ward Union Hunt itself is the smallest part of the equation.  It is quite a small organisation but the benefits that accrue from its activities are spread far and wide throughout the county.The Ward Union Hunt itself would say that it has not got everything right in the past.  People with a contrary view to mine have contacted me and the Minister in that regard.  That must be acknowledged.  However, in fairness to the Ward Union Hunt, it has made efforts to change and improve things and the improvements are noticeable.Public safety is raised constantly.  We cannot keep talking about an incident, however unfortunate, that took place four years ago in Kildalkey.  We cannot keep harping on about that.  An incident also occurred at Christmas.  They are individual isolated incidents that occur every few years.  It is unfortunate that the Minister could not be specific about another incident.My biggest concern is that we are legislating to target one particular hunt.  I question whether it is constitutional to do that.  Has the Attorney General advised in that regard?  Can one legislate to punish one individual or group?  The legislation has similarities to the old Bills of attainder which are not constitutional.  How can we as legislators target individuals, people we know?  It is not right.  They are doing things they and their ancestors have done for generations.That is the way they live.  My colleague and friend, Deputy Mary Wallace, referred to proportionality, which has constitutional implications.  President McAleese might consider raising this Bill with the Council of State before assenting to it.This is a very difficult issue for me.  I am committed to the Government.  I was elected to represent the Fianna Fáil Party in Meath-East and believe we are implementing the right economic policies to get the country back into shape.  I must be committed to my constituents, who are absolutely opposed to this legislation.  Why are we even spending time on it when there are so many other problems facing the people?

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I ask the Minister to state in his closing remarks that if this Bill is passed he will have no issues to deal with in regard to animal welfare other than the couple of very minor ones in the programme for Government.  The people do not believe there are no other issues.  I am trying to explain to them that this Bill is Green Party policy.  I want Deputy Gormley, in his capacity as Minister, to explain that there are no other issues.  Deputy Johnny Brady outlined his very stark position on this and I agreed with him.  The backbenchers of Fianna Fáil certainly agree.Confidence and reassurance need to be given, particularly to gun clubs, which seem to be of the view that they will be targeted.  The confusion is not lessened by some of the Minister's colleagues who differentiate between certain types of shooting and sports activities in their statements.  That the Minister make the strongest possible statement on other pursuits is essential.This is a difficult issue and has become very political.  It is right that it has become a political issue.  My seat will be one of the most prized by the Opposition parties at the next general election.  This must also be acknowledged.I acknowledge the remarks of Deputy McEntee, who said this is a difficult issue for us.  He will receive great praise from the people of his constituency for his fight on this issue.  He has been reasonable to his Government colleagues and this favour will certainly be returned if the Deputy is in a difficult position if his party is ever in Government.The Minister's Department is causing many problems in Meath-East over one-off housing applications.  I refer to its making submissions on one-off housing applications inside and far away from the Newgrange buffer zone.  This is generating great mistrust.  I do not know what business the Minister's officials have making submissions on the planning applications of young couples.  It is terrible that the Department spends time on this.  There is no national policy interest whatsoever in this regard.When I talk to the people of my constituency, it is not just the issues of the Ward Union Hunt that arise.  The Minister must understand that.  People ask why he objected to their planning permission applications and makes submissions thereon.  The Department is doing so in his name.  I ask that it cease doing so because it cannot be legal.I have always complimented the Minister on his progressive action on zoning and local area plans and I fully endorse and support what he is doing this week through the planning investigations.  I come from an area where this activity could not but be supported because of the damage done through bad zoning.  However, my problem is with the response to one-off planning applications whose acceptance would keep a community together and give young people a chance to build their own home at a lower cost.  If accepted, the couples would not have to go on the council's list or live in certain areas where the facilities are not as good.  They would have the opportunity to live in their own communities.  The Minister is making it difficult for himself, the Government and me as a Member.  I ask the Department to stop making submissions on the applications to which I refer.This legislation is not right and the Oireachtas should not be targeting individual organisations or groups.  I welcome the provision that the Minister is including in the legislation that regularises licensing for shooting game and wildlife.  That may give some reassurance to the gun clubs although many of the constituents I spoke to on it today were not convinced.I ask the Minister to confirm in his closing remarks that there is nothing else he wants to target.  He has made such a statement time and again but we badly need to hear one once more.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I am very angry about this issue.  I do not have the experience of the Ward Union Hunt that Deputies Johnny Brady, Mary Wallace and Thomas Byrne have.  They spoke from the heart about it, specifically on the hunt.  I want to follow up on Deputy Byrne's remarks.  People believe the Minister is against the Irish countryside.  He has his idea of the countryside and does not mind what happens to communities, community groups, football clubs, schools, churches or any other body.Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned one-off housing, which is irrelevant to this Bill, but it is related to the attitude that informs it.  People know the Minister and his party are trying to ensure those who want to live on the farms on which they were born and reared, or near thereto, will no longer have the opportunity to do so.The Ward Union Hunt has a proud tradition.  During the debate on this issue, I became annoyed by the efforts of some to claim the Ward Union Hunt is an old British club that has nothing to do with Ireland.  It has a long association with Irish traditions, as Deputy Thomas Byrne stated.  It is certainly not tied to the elements that have been suggested.The Bill is short and one could deal with it in five minutes.  Its purpose is to deal with the Ward Union Hunt and to make some changes to the fines regime.  It makes some welcome changes, as has been said.The Minister referred to the history of the Ward Union Hunt and outlined the dangers of hunting.  He stated his concerns are shared by some of his predecessors.  He referred to public safety issues and said it is simply not possible for hunters to prevent deer in flight from leaping through hedges onto public roads.  He recalled the incident regarding one deer who entered a children's playground.  It is easy to pick out one incident.Yesterday I spoke to the Minister's colleague from County Meath, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, about the road from Derry to Dublin.  It links the capital to the fourth biggest city and Donegal.  We are planning to give the Northern Ireland Assembly £400 million to provide a road from Derry to Aughnacloy, yet we have no plans to construct a road from Aughnacloy to Castleshane.Only a few months ago, a juggernaut came around the corner in Emyvale village and drove straight into a group of houses.  It was a miracle that nobody was killed.  One family was in Scotland for a few days for a family function and the others were not at home at the time.  The houses can be seen by anybody.Many people have been killed on the road between Monaghan and Emyvale but there is not the same urgency in the House about it as there is about this Bill.  We must get our House in order and realise where we can save human lives.  I am not saying we should abuse stock; I love stock, I am a farmer and have lived with stock all my life.  To isolate this issue and make a big deal about it is a sham.The Minister states hunting is dangerous to people and hard on the animals.  From reports I have read, there are very different views on this.  As the Minister's Fianna Fáil colleagues have said, further study needs to be done on it and a report needs to be produced before a hammer is used to crack a nut.  There must be some common sense in that.  While the Minister's Fianna Fáil colleagues requested such a study, unfortunately, they went on to state that they were, because of party structures, voting for this Bill regardless.I attended two meetings organised by the hunting and shooting fraternity.  I can tell the Minister that those meetings were packed.  One of them was in the Westenra Arms Hotel in Monaghan town, the other was in the Lavey Inn in Cavan.  These meetings were packed with people who had only an interest in a bit of sport.  They were not vicious, they were not antagonistic, they were just begging for the right to carry on the traditions that their people have carried on for the past hundreds of years.My neighbours are deeply involved in both hunting and shooting, and some of them in other hunt clubs.  Those people, if they are in a hunt club, contact the people in the area in which they will hunt.  They do not do it behind people's backs.  They are welcome.  Especially on my own farm, they are extremely welcome wherever they want to go, let it be hunting, shooting or whatever else.While the Minister is saying today that it is only the Ward hunt club that he is interested in, they are in no doubt whatsoever, from the information they are getting from the websites and elsewhere in the Green Party, that this is the first shot at all of the different aspects of Irish culture and Irish life.  When I think of all the joy that those people have got down through the years in all sorts of areas of hunting, shooting, etc., I am scared for the future of this country,——

On the Sunday night, the Minister blocked that area of rural Monaghan from getting any more planning permissions.  We know exactly how the Minister operates.We know exactly how the Minister operates on other issues.  I remember getting a letter from him, through the county council, stating that he had dealt with the matter the previous January, at which time he was sitting behind me here.  It was clear that he had not even read the letter that he was supposed to have signed.  Those are simple facts.We are extremely worried about where this is leading.  Turf-cutting is another issue.  When I think of all the people who cut their few bits of turf, the bogs are there for generations.  I have been on them, I live beside them and I do not have to be told by anybody that they will not be there hundreds of years from now.  We were told that there would be no more snow and no more sun, but we got both snow and sun this year.  We must have some idea of what we are talking about.This is an ongoing assault by the Minister on rural Ireland.

I can tell him there is a football club there which has its own clubhouse.  There is a community centre.  There are churches and schools that are reasonably full.It is all right talking but if the Minister's rules on planning go through, there will not be another house built in that area if he can possibly stop it.  That is a fact.  The regulations are so tight on effluent and other issues that it will not happen.  All that has happened is houses have replaced other houses that were there for a previous generation.  They are now nearer the public roads than they were previously, but those are the facts and I can stand over them.Other issues the Minister raised in his speech were extremely interesting.  He spoke of the need for culling of deer.  He realises at this stage that the Bill, as initiated, restricted groups such as hunting groups to two dogs and that simply cannot work.  He has agreed to amend that and some other issues, which I welcome.It is impossible to understand this.  I often go through the Phoenix Park where there are deer, but there is a 30 mph restriction and it is not too bad if a deer runs out in front of you because you should be able to stop.  What if one is going along the road at Dartry at 80 km/h and a deer jumps out in front of one?  I can tell the Minister the number of persons who were maimed and seriously injured as a result of that wood and that situation.  The only way that can be controlled is, as the Minister stated here, to allow for proper structures and proper licensing.  There is no guarantee if he lets three or four dogs in through that wood, as there is no fence along the road, that a deer will not come out in front of a car or someone else.  This issue about one incident with the Ward hunt just does not make sense.  However, I welcome the fact that that issue is dealt with.The Minister also spoke here about the new computerised procedures for issuing gun licences.  We blame Brussels all of the time for the delicate and difficult forms one must fill in.  The number of people who I have had into my home and into my office regarding that gun licence over the past number of months was unbelievable.  They got this nine-page form to fill in for a simple single-barrel shotgun that they have had in their house for generations and they had to get people to sign that they were of good behaviour and they had to get their photograph put on their licence.  They had to get all sorts of things.  When one reads of all the guns that are flying about through this city, Limerick and elsewhere, one wonders what the system is all about.  We blame Brussels for all the bureaucracy when it suits us, but here was bureaucracy brought in by the Government.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	409	At the end of the day, lo and behold, with all nine pages, we hear an admission by the Minister that the Government did not provide for a hunting licence attachment and therefore the new certificates do not meet the legal requirements.  It is unbelievable.  So many aged farmers living on their own and all they wanted was to have the gun in their house to shoot a few crows, rabbits or whatever, and have it for safety as well.  They had to go through all of this rigmarole.  At the end of the day, the people who really needed the licences could not get them because the Bill was not properly drawn up.  I worry that all this rushed legislation that is going through will give rise to many such difficulties.  The Minister stated that by the time the oversight was identified, it was not practicable to recall the certificates issued nor to change the licensing process that was in train.  I have spoken with many of those involved.  They were alarmed by the stupidity shown during the dog issue and by the failure to get the licensing right.The Government has a record on issues such as this, in that legislation is being rushed through just to stop the Ward hunt.  I am not directly involved in that hunt, although I have known of it and the enjoyment it has given people for many years.  Some people do not like it, which is their right, but it provides considerable employment and a good service, as mentioned by Deputy Brady and others.  I hope the Minister will spell out what will happen to all of that.  Who will shoot all the hounds and do away with the deer?The Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 has frightened the life out of many people.  The sorts of regulation it will introduce will affect ordinary people in the hunt business.  Will the Minister ensure that realistic changes are made to the Bill by the time it enters the Dáil so that it will not abuse an ordinary person who keeps a few beagles for winter hunting, cost him or her massive amounts of money and force him or her to meet all sorts of unjustified regulation?I have no love or support for anyone who abuses the system.  When we spoke at a meeting in Monaghan, a colleague from not too far away from me who spoke on the Minister's behalf stated he knew of an outrageous dog kennel located only one mile from his house.  He did not name the kennel, but I have been living in the area long enough to be able to check out the only dog kennel of which I know in the locality.  The owner is a huntsman who keeps the place pristine.  I visited the following weekend to check whether the kennel had deteriorated since I had last seen it.  I assure the Minister it was perfect.  I just wish all humans were being looked after as well as that group of hounds.  A flippant remark like that to try to justify unjustifiable actions does no one any good.State-run dog kennels are causing serious problems for their neighbours, yet no effort is being made to silence the former.  It is wrong that some of the people attending my office cannot sleep at night or, if they work at night, sleep during the day because someone visiting the house next door raises the noise of the dogs.  I am referring to something that is being run with the support of the State as a local authority dog pound.  This example gives the Minister an idea of some of the difficulties with State-run kennels.  They are not perfect and I hope they can improve, but accusations are being made against decent people who are going about their business and having a bit of sport.  They are being abused.The Minister has the weekend to consider what his colleagues sitting behind him are saying.  I am not asking him to consider what I have stated.  His County Meath colleagues, who have lived with this hunt for generations, know what it is all about.  For God's sake, listen to and be guided by them.  It is not too late to decide to withdraw this Bill.  I know people in the Enniskillen hunt, which goes into the Clones area.  Members of one of the families involved are my best friends and invite me to the hunt regularly.  It is nothing but sport.  It is not abuse or anything else.  Were we dealing with the crisis in health or social welfare——

The stag is a noble animal and I hold no brief for stag hunting, which is confined to County Meath and is not directly an issue for County Tipperary.  It is wrong to believe that all people living in the country are uncritically supportive of field sports.  A telephone or Internet poll in the Tipperary Star that I would not necessarily trust completely asked whether blood sports should be banned and received a two thirds response in favour.Stag hunting raises different health and safety issues than fox hunting.  Stags are large animals capable of killing people if they collide with them or their vehicles.  There is a difference between the sports, in that the fox knows most of the terrain in which it is being hunted whereas a carted stag released into the countryside does not.  The ban in this legislation is, if I understand the Minister correctly, without prejudice to lawful stalking or culling.The Bourbons are entering into our debates regularly.  One does not need to be a female Minister to be likened to Marie Antoinette.  Later Bourbons were criticised by Talleyrand as having learned nothing and forgotten nothing.  I prefer his statement, "Not too much zeal", which might apply to both extremes of the blood sport debate.  Last Sunday, a political correspondent referred to a comment attributed to Louis XV and-or Madame de Pompadour — "After us, the deluge" — in respect of my party.  The Bourbons were indefatigable hunters responsible for significant animal carnage.  Louis XV reportedly killed 204 stags in one year and his grandson, the ill-fated Louis XVI, famously wrote a single word, "Nothing", in his journal on 14 July 1789, the day of the fall of the Bastille, because he had not succeeded in killing a stag.  Stag hunting was reserved to the privileged and was the subject of a string of complaints by the Third Estate.  The privileged nomenclature of the Soviet Union likewise indulged in the sport.  An 1875 picture of the Ward Union Hunt featuring the Earl of Meath was recently sold in the auction rooms.  Nowadays, it is a sport favoured by, among other worthy people, one or more builders and property developers who have figured prominently in dispatches.  I am sure they will be pleasantly surprised——

The Deputy is in Parliament to support his or her opinion of the public good and does not form an opinion to get into or continue in Parliament.  I hope we are not spineless lackeys of the last opinion poll or the last angry person or lobby group to get in touch with us.  While I respect the opinions of all my constituents, I do not agree that this is a matter of such importance that the Government should stand or fall on it.  I am surprised at the opposition of the Labour Party, which presumably means the measure will be repealed if the Labour Party is in government with Fine Gael alone.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I was born in Kildare and have lived there all my life.  It has become known as the thoroughbred country and I admit a certain love for horses.  They are a major part of life in Kildare.  The industry is a large employer in Kildare.  Whether people are employed in the industry or enjoy horses for sport, it is something we are familiar with in Kildare.  Training yards and stud farms provide valuable employment, mainly in rural areas where it would be difficult to find alternative employment should the need arise.The hunt has a long and distinguished record in Ireland and a proud tradition.  Most villages have pictures of hunts going back over many years and there is something beautiful about watching a hunt in action.  Man has always hunted.  Today, that hunt takes on a different meaning but people appreciate that it has a proud historic record.  This Bill has attracted much publicity.  People who do not hunt or engage in rural activities have little understanding or appreciation of why others partake in the activity and the joy, fun and craic that people have on a hunt.The renewed programme for Government, which was agreed in October 2009, included a commitment to end deer hunting by stag hounds.  The Ward Union Hunt Club has been operating for more than 150 years and is the only club with a stag hunt.  It has approximately 200 active members.  I know some of these people personally and I regard them as normal, natural people.  In any group of 200 people one can select a few and try to tarnish them all with the same brush.  The same could be said of the 166 Deputies. The members of the Ward Union Hunt Club are normal people who enjoy a particular activity.  From my knowledge of them, they are animal lovers who take great pleasure in participating in a stag hunt.  It was with surprise that these club members realised we were introducing legislation to ban an activity they, their parents and their grandparents had enjoyed for many years.  Why are they being singled out?  Why is the Government pushing ahead with this legislation?  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, has provided the licence that has allowed the activity to take place in recent times.  We are proposing to ban an activity that has taken place for generations.  If the legislation is passed, these men and women who decide to continue their hobby will become criminals.The debate that has taken place would lead one to believe deer are killed every day a hunt takes place but the facts tell a different story.  During the hunt of 11 December 2009 a deer collided with a vehicle and, following the intervention of two vets, the animal had to be put down.  However, during the hunt season 2009-10, no other deer died.  Many people, the majority of whom are not members of the hunt, are asking whether this legislation is the start of a major attack on rural pursuits.  This Minister has said that it is not but I ask the Minister to publish a list of proposals presented by the Green Party during negotiations for the renewed programme for Government.  This will clarify the issue of the genuine fear of many rural people.  I regret we are debating the legislation in this way.  I regret the application of the guillotine on this debate.  Many Members would like to contribute for far longer than the time the allocated.  I regret the introduction of legislation to criminalise a long and proud tradition in Ireland.

I am pleased to have speaking time on this proposed Bill, even if it is confined to five minutes.  I was grateful to receive the co-operation of the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Sean Fleming, to speak at the committee meetings on the proposals in this Bill.  I had reservations and concerns about the original proposals.As a rural Deputy from North Tipperary, where the horse, hound and deer are synonymous with rural life, it was with regret that I learned last October that the ban on the 200 year tradition of the Ward Union Hunt in County Meath was part of the newly agreed programme for Government.  It was brought about with absolutely no negotiation or consultation with the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, which makes it all the more difficult to proceed in supporting this Bill.  I acknowledge the correspondence and telephone calls I received from Meath and people all over Ireland, seeking the retention of the Ward Union Hunt Club.  I also acknowledge the anti-blood sports groups who, in a much smaller volume, made known their thoughts to me.  I am fully aware of the high standards of animal welfare practice undertaken by the members of the Ward Union Hunt Club, some of whom are personal friends of mine.  These people are of the highest decency and integrity, strongly involved in their communities and in activities outside the Ward Union Hunt Club.  I acknowledge the co-operation of the Ward Union Hunt Club in the provision of vets, road marshals and volunteer workers.  They all work with the Ward Union Hunt Club to increase safety of humans and of animals in the hunt procedure.I regret there was no consultation with the Ward Union Hunt Club and the absence of a regulatory impact statement prior to introducing this legislation.  There are no solutions offered, following the enactment of the Bill, to the loss of jobs and the future of the very valuable fallen animals service carried out by the Ward Union Hunt Club.  I acknowledge the work of the fallen animals service, efficiently carried out by the Ward Union Hunt Club.  That service must be replaced.  On that basis, I support my colleagues' call on the Minister to carry out that impact assessment and permit another licensed season to the Ward Union Hunt Club pending the assessment of the financial impact on County Meath as a result of this legislation.On section 3, it is clear also that Coillte and the National Parks and Wildlife Service were not consulted in the original drafting of the Bill.  It is a recognised and long-established procedure that in the event where two or three deer stalkers hunt together they each might be accompanied by a tracker dog.  I note that in other European countries, in the absence of a dog, qualified and authorised tracker dogs are brought in to hunt down the fallen animal to ensure the least pain is endured by the animal in the event of hunting.I am pleased that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has acknowledged that the original proposals in section 3 were not viable.  It is a requirement of hunting leases issued by Coillte that a hunter is either accompanied by a tracking dog or that they have access to a tracking dog when stalking deer.  The use of dogs is a humane requirement to ensure the swift tracking of wounded deer.  Had a regulatory impact assessment been carried out prior to the publishing of the Bill, the deletion of the proposals would not have to be visited now.  I say to the Minister that amendments to section 3 are not required.  The deletion of section 3 is all that is needed.I understand the Minister's officials had a positive meeting recently with the representatives of the Wild Deer Association and the Irish Deer Association but, unfortunately, the Minister has not met with the associations.  Much of the confusion surrounding the practice of these rural pursuits would be eliminated if the Minister were to meet with them.  I encourage the Minister to do so and to address the other outstanding issues in regard to rural pursuits in the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill.  My written concerns are on the Minister's desk and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss those with him.  I am grateful for the opportunity to express my concerns regarding the matters I have outlined.

Bhí an-díomá air nach raibh níos mó déanta ar an ábhar seo sar a fuair sé bás.I wish to focus on the hunt aspect and the proposal to prohibit stag hunting with hounds in Ireland, which will apply to the Ward Union Hunt.  I believe this is a humane and an enlightened initiative that is long overdue.Do we have some romantic view of the hunt in terms of the red jackets, the men and women on horseback and, I understand these days, on quads and jeeps, with the horns blowing, the dogs baying and the so-called thrill of the chase?  The words I use are animal cruelty.  There are incidents of deer becoming entangled in barbed wire, drowned and chocked to death.  Do we really want to see images of hunted deer covered in blood, wounded, bitten and bruised, with steaming tongues hanging out as they drop to the ground exhausted?  The hunt is causing unnecessary suffering to these animals.  It is a gruelling experience that can last up to and even longer than three hours.I cite, as the late Deputy Tony Gregory did in the Dáil debate of October 2007, the veterinary documents which show the injuries and fatalities.  They include fractured ribs, ruptured aortic aneurysms, a deer collapsing and dying after desperately trying to escape over an 8 ft high wall.  There is considerable photographic and video evidence of the cruelty, and reports in newspapers of numerous incidents of cruelty.  Is it sport to terrify an animal so unnecessarily and for what?A significant aspect regarding the Ward Union Hunt is its hunting of tame domesticated deer.  Where is the fairness or the sport in pursuing a domesticated deer — domesticated like the Minister's dog or mine — and hunt it down to the point of exhaustion?  We are aware of the incident of the stag being hunted into the school yard.  Savage hands set on the stag and it was then hunted onto a public road and was pursued until it collapsed, and that is considered sport.  Apart from the cruelty to the animals there is also the risk to road users and members of the public.A significant number of farmers object to their farms and land being invaded, trespassed upon and vandalised, with fences, crops and livestock damaged and destroyed.  They want their lands preserved from stag hunting which is threatening their work to produce healthy, quality food.  Their "No Hunting" signs are being blatantly ignored by the hunt.The Ward Union Hunt states that it has implemented a wide range of health and safety measures in recent years.  That is equivalent to telling a prisoner that after being tortured a doctor will be on hand to bandage the wounds.  What health and safety measures can be brought in that will alleviate deliberate suffering and torture of an animal?  That is a total contradiction.I am fascinated by the notion of monitoring a hunt, which I find ludicrous.  Will some of the conditions be that the hounds can bite only five times instead of 20, the stag will be chased for only one hour instead of three or the hunt will use only 20 hounds instead of 40.  Perhaps specific injuries will be allowed?  How can we tell a hound that it cannot directly kill the deer; just terrify and exhaust it to death.I represent Dublin Central but I have many affiliations with rural Ireland, including down the road from where the Ward Union Hunt operates.  This is not an attack on rural Ireland and to see it portrayed as thus is scare-mongering and deliberately clouding the issue.  The Bill simply aims to protect deer from being hounded to exhaustion, injury and death for so-called fun.  Is it the view of those opposing the Bill that fun equals subjecting an animal to prolonged and agonising torture and hounding it to death?  I support the Bill and hope to see it passed in the House.

There is a feeling that the Green Party members need to deliver something to their constituency and that the handiest way of doing that is to ban some form of hunting.That may be a cynical view but in the absence of the Green Party having been unable to prevent the swingeing cuts across all areas of public and social provision that they said they would oppose when in Opposition, it does make sense.  It is also the case that the Green Party's constituency, or what remains of it, is inimical to and, some might claim, ignorant of much of what happens in rural Ireland.There are also claims in some quarters that the Green Party regards this as their Stalingrad and have intimated that if the legislation is not passed as proposed and that if all Fianna Fáil Deputies do not vote for it they may consider pulling out of Government.  That might appear ill-conceived but given that the Green Party has little if any chance of retaining its existing seats as matters stand, it might make some sense.It might be regarded as a cynical view if they were to take that course.  It might also be seen to be somewhat hypocritical of the Green Party to take such a strong and principled position on the rights of deer while having spent the past three years meekly supporting various measures that have impinged on the lives and indeed rights of hundreds of thousands of Irish people.It is a bit much that a party that was prepared to support the health cuts, impose wage cuts on public servants, and preside over the bailing out of the speculators that they were so eloquent in denouncing when they were on this side of the House should choose this issue as the one on which to make a stand.  It is perhaps commendable that they have at least retained some vestiges of the principles they claim, but we are entitled to balance that against all the other things which they have done since they have been in power.In regard to the issue of banning hunting, and the belief that this current Bill if successful will be followed by attempts to ban other rural pursuits, a number of issues need to be borne in mind when making this decision.  There is the legitimate argument that the State, the State acting on behalf of a section of the electorate or, in this case, one political party, ought not to have the right to ban activities just because someone else does not like them.  There are many people who do not like this form of hunting, and they are entitled to their beliefs.  However, they are not entitled to have it banned simply on that basis.The only basis on which they would be entitled would be if it could be proved that the practise in question was either cruel, deliberately designed to kill the animal being pursued or that the animal in question was an endangered species.  None of that applies as far as I can see in this instance.There is also the argument, including on behalf of people who have no particular interest in or affection for stag hunting, that if this activity is banned the way will be open to ban other sports involving animals.  That could include hare coursing, for example, and I have little doubt that if this Bill is successful that will be the next target.There is also the belief that the desire to ban rural pursuits would not stop there, and some of the leading advocates of banning blood sports have made no secret of their opposition to horse racing, fishing and greyhound racing.  I have been on radio programmes on occasions with some of those people and they have refused to say that is not part of their agenda.  If the bottom line is that humans should not use animals for sport then the logic would certainly lead to that.My party's position is clear.  At the Ard Fheis earlier this year, we passed a motion upholding the right to organise regulated and licensed hunting, as long as there is stringent regulation to protect the sustainability of a given population and to prevent the infliction of unnecessary cruelty through hunting practice.We cannot support an outright ban on the form of hunting as proposed in this Bill in the absence of clear evidence of risk to population sustainability and of evidence of cruelty.  Risk to the sustainability of the red deer population is not an issue and no sustainability evidence has been adduced.  The only issue to be assessed is whether stag hunting with hounds generally, or the specific practice of carted stag hunting in particular, constitutes cruel practice in hunting.The 1997 Kane report found no intentional cruelty related to the Ward Union Hunt.  However, it found inhumane practice related to the manner and design of cart transportation and that domesticated deer in particular are generally unfit for prolonged chase.  Importantly, the 1998 Kane and Guthrie report on the welfare of deer, which appears to have been much more thorough and scientific in its approach and methodology, did not find significant health and welfare issues related to this practice.There is also the fact that hunts often proceed illegally in the face of an outright ban.  Such illegal hunts would not be subject to the controls that currently apply to the now highly regulated Ward Union Hunt.  These were made even more stringent with the introduction of new licensing conditions in 2008, including monitoring by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and veterinary supervision.Regarding the economic aspects of this issue, it is estimated that the Ward Union club keeps approximately 30 people in direct, indirect and ancillary employment.  This breaks down to four full-time equivalents in direct employment, 13 grooms in indirect employment and 11 in ancillary trades.  Income to the locality is estimated at approximately €1 million per annum.  Hence in the worst case scenario, the legislation could result in the loss of up to 30 jobs and a loss of €1 million per annum to the local economy in Meath.For all these reasons Sinn Féin will be opposing the Bill as drafted.

Issues around these areas must be treated with respect for their complexity and each considered on their merits.Between 1993 and 1997, I had ministerial responsibility for many of the matters contained in this legislation.  Before the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, leaves the Chamber, I must say it is absolutely outrageous to suggest that I and any Member of the Labour Party are in favour of cruelty to animals or bloodsports.  When I was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I ended by regulation the possibility of any deer being killed and my colleague, Deputy Brian O'Shea, regulated for greyhounds to wear muzzles to eliminate the kill in coursing.  Those are the facts.  I want this debate to be unemotive and practical.Between 1988 and 1996 no licence had been issued to the Ward Union Hunt.  I took the position that the Wildlife Act 1976 had not been properly observed.  Accordingly, I asked for time to investigate how the Ward Union Hunt took place.The results of my actions are contained in my replies to parliamentary questions then.  For example, Parliamentary Question No. 25 on 20 February 1997, tabled by Deputy Sargent, asked about the outcome of the monitoring of deer hunting activities by the Ward Union Hunt and if I would have regard to the many landowners, road-users and compassionate members of the public, both rural and urban, who object to deer hunting with hounds before deciding on future policy on this activity.I believed this activity should have been monitored and controlled but it had not between 1988 and 1996.  In my reply, I drew his attention to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 126 on 22 October 1996 which gave a historical background to the issue.  I also informed Deputy Sargent:Following this reply there was an exchange of correspondence between the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department and the Ward Union hunt club in relation to the requirements for a licence under the 1976 Act for carted stag hunting. Ultimately, this correspondence resulted in an application for a licence.The reply also listed the conditions I had attached to the licence which included the health and condition of the animal before and after the hunt, the treatment of the animal during the hunt, the control of the hounds and the behaviour of those on horseback.  I was seeking to operate with as much consensus as I could to ensure no allegation of cruelty could be made.Due to the deer used in the hunt being reared domestically, I decided to hand over the responsibility of ongoing examinations to the then Department of Agriculture.  I also commissioned a report on the Ward Union Hunt from K.W.S. Kane, a veterinary inspector, which was presented to me on 16 May 1997.  Mr. Kane made criticisms about how the deer were transported to the hunt, that is, carting and so forth.  As I was about to leave office, I wrote a note for my officials stating that we should address the additional necessary conditions to ensure there was no stress on the deer.  I had already eliminated the kill element in deer hunting, as did Deputy Brian O'Shea with the hare in coursing.  It is an outrageous untruth — I cannot use the other word that I would like to use — to suggest the Labour party has changed its position.  It does not serve the Minister, Deputy Gormley, well and adds to his reputation for bitter pills.I had ministerial responsibility for heritage when it was managed properly.  I took decisions that were not popular but necessary.  Why did the Minister not use the conditions I had laid down?  If he felt there were new circumstances surrounding public safety, why did he not add them as new conditions and require them to be attached to a licence?  Instead, the Minister has done a sloppy thing by taking the capacity of the Minister out of the 1976 Act.  That is lazy.  If he had left it untouched, he would have given himself the space and obligation to put in conditions that would guarantee no cruelty would be experienced.  The Minister must explain why he went instead for the simplistic approach.  By striking down this section, he has removed certain other ministerial capacities.There are differences between us on our ministerial approaches to this issue.  When I was Minister, I began with animal welfare while this Minister, Deputy Gormley, has begun with a ban.  For example, I foresee serious problems arising in respect of stalking if the legislation does not specify the conditions under which a person may shoot at a deer.  Sometimes deer are wounded and wander in a wounded condition, something which directly affects an animal in a way far greater than an animal that has been carted.  I am not making comparisons for idle purposes.  Other issues arise such as the question of how irresponsible it would be to make the animal welfare conditional on property ownership.  Under this proposed legislation, if one owns property one can take as many dogs as one wishes to drive a deer off one's property.  How can one declare that represents animal welfare?  How can one say that enhances public safety?  These are glaring blemishes in the legislation although the Minister and I are agreed that we wish to end up in the same place.It is outrageous to make a cheap comment to the effect that I have changed my mind on animal welfare.  I have not.  I would simply do this in a different way.  I could have taken these conditions and the Minister could have built on them.The Minister has done something politically dangerous.  During his speech this afternoon, he provided a number of guarantees.  He has said it will only be this and this alone.  In doing so, he has enabled other issues to be removed from the agenda.  He has provoked a reaction that will provide a shelter for those who do not want other issues to be addressed.  Many people who objected to the Ward Union Hunt — I am familiar with some of these people — objected to some of the participants as much as the practice itself.  They took the view that it was ridiculous that some of the best know speculators would mount on horseback and behave like the new gentry and go galloping across people's land.  I have some sympathy for that view because I recall in my youth getting a half a crown in County Clare for opening the gate for people propped up on horseback.  We were entertained to guess how quickly they would fall off.We must draw a distinction.  I hold no brief for the social composition of the Ward Union Hunt.  I refer to other members of the hunt.  When I made my moves in 1996 I distinctly remember some very distinguished families from County Meath, including relatives of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bruton, coming to see me and explaining the outrageousness of my proposals.  The point is my approach was very different from that of the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  I met the Irish Council Against Blood Sports.  I provided the date of the meeting in the answer to the question.  I also met the Ward Union Hunt.  I used the Heritage Council to prepare a report.  I consulted as widely as possible.  I took the view that although I was proceeding slowly, it was the way to achieve the best result.  I finished putting in place these conditions in 1996 or 1997.  It is true that two reports were carried out, namely, the Kane report and the Guthrie report.  As far as I was concerned, if this activity could never be sufficiently controlled with conditions attached to licence, one should keep adding to the licence conditions until it had withered on the vine.This is not what the Minister has done.  He has made a gesture out of the legislation.  I listened patiently to the speeches given from all sides of the House.  The Minister has enabled a reaction to be composed and that reaction will oppose other issues.  I do not believe the Minister is against rural Ireland and it is outrageous for people to suggest as much.  We should be mature about how we approach these matters.  It is unfortunate that the content of the legislation is so flawed and that the tactics in bringing this legislation to the House are equally flawed.  It is disastrous that the issue has been so divisive.Heritage issues within the Minister's Department have been damaged, which is a great pity.  People have made very reasonable points.  I refer to parts of the country where people who were farming would not cut the hooves of their donkeys.  The poor old ass was crippled with neglect.  I refer to the cruelty of those refusing to allow the issue of the urban horse to be addressed, which is scandalous.  These are real issues.I dealt in a complicated way with a point the Minster has in the proposed legislation.  His officials will advise him on whether the Attorney General has waived on the matter.  I dealt with the issue of when an animal is considered feral according to the description under the Wildlife Act 1976 or when an animal is considered domesticated, in which case it is a matter for the Minister with responsibility for agriculture.  It is a genuine attempt by the Minister in the relevant section to use the phrase "any other deer".  I suggest the Minister examines this seriously before Committee Stage because I suspect it is legislatively fragile.  I do not say this to score a point but this was an area for which I held responsibility.It is not the case that there has been any great change in the Labour Party's position.  It is simply a matter of the way in which this legislation is put together, the context in which it has been delivered and the consequences it has with regard to dividing communities that should combine to treat heritage issues adequately.  This is why the Labour Party has a reservation on the matter.  Our opposition to cruelty, our love of animals, our loyalty to urban and rural animals and so forth remain the same.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	448	No.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I have no connection with the hunt or the people involved.  However, I speak as someone with a love of animals.  We have always kept dogs in the family home and currently we keep two beautiful cavaliers.  I represent a vast number of constituents from Dublin North who are actively involved in the hunt and others not involved in the hunt but who support it.Let us consider the history of the Ward Union Hunt over 150 years.  It has produced many famous people in the horse riding business, including members of the Carberry family, Paul, Philip and Nina, as well as Barry Geraghty, Kevin Manning and the trainer, Noel Meade.  As Irish people, we roar on these people whether at race meetings on the television such as Cheltenham and the Aintree Grand National or at home.  All of these people honed their skills by participating in the Ward Union Hunt and by riding out their ponies and becoming accomplished horse riders.We should carry out an impact assessment on the business activities related to the hunt.  A total of four direct employees are involved with the Ward Union Hunt and it has a business turnover of €1.4 million.  We are all aware that the horse breeding business is of the order of €1 billion for the Irish economy.  If we were discussing any other aspect of business life, there is no way any Member would suggest we do something arbitrarily that would impact on a €1 billion business or a local business worth almost €1.5 million.  One need only consider the activities involved to realise how that business is comprised.  Apart from the buying and selling of horses, at issue is jobs in animal feed, including feed for horses and hounds tack and riding equipment, transportation, farriers and vets.  That is to ignore the local shops, pubs and restaurants, all of which attract great business during the hunting season.  I do not subscribe to the view that we should write off that business without a thorough investigation.  I do not subscribe to that.  I implore the Minister that before he makes this decision to ban the hunt, he does what we call for in all walks of life, namely, that we investigate this.  As a courtesy to this House and the Seanad, I ask him to bring us a report and to come back in the autumn or mid-winter after we have gone through all the facts and figures to discuss them.  If there are issues in terms of animals suffering, let us deal with them.As I said, I do not have any involvement in this but I have had discussions with many people.  There is general consensus that there is no animal cruelty involved.  I would like the Minister to give an assurance that he will carry out an assessment and give us three or four months to investigate this, which is reasonable.Other speakers referred to the fallen animal service the Ward Union Hunt provides.  Has the Minister discussed with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, what replacement service will be put in place if the Ward Union Hunt ceases to exist?  Almost 5,000 dead animals are collected all over north Dublin and Meath.  They are collected quickly, efficiently and at a subsidised cost to the farmer.  I know from talking to one of the veterinarians involved in this process that we will not have this service whereby the animal is collected from the farm within hours, which is very important from the point of view of our reputation as a food producing nation.  Will we replace that service quickly, efficiently and at the same cost?I listened attentively to Deputy Higgins.  The conditions and restrictions he imposed as Minister were reasonable and practical and were further refined last year by the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  There is no reason we should not endeavour to continue to refine them.  We can avoid similar incidents to the one or two which occurred with the licensing arrangements but it is not right to ban this because there has been one incident.The whole purpose of any consultation process is to thoroughly investigate.  I am not saying people should not have different opinions to mine but we should thoroughly investigate how we can improve this before we reach the ultimate decision to ban the activity.From my observations of deer, I believe they are wild animals.  They are brought up as wild and to run.  Instinctively, I believe they expect to be hunted.  I am not suggesting for one second that they should be mauled by hounds or anything like that.  I would abhor that.  I would have a greater problem with hare coursing where I believe greyhounds get very close to the unfortunate hare.Will the Minister put this Bill on hold for the next three or four months?  Let us carry out an assessment on how we can regulate more if we need more regulation and restrictions.  In terms of the business aspect, people in north Dublin, Meath and elsewhere enjoy a good business and God knows we need to protect and courage business given the job losses and the recession.I hope the Minister will make a pragmatic decision and will ask for a report.  He has asked for many other reports.  Currently, he is correctly looking for reports on local authorities.  He has not sought to abolish Cork County Council because he is investigating it.  He has merely asked for an investigation and he should do the same in this case.I listened to Deputy Higgins speak about his involvement.  He met the Ward Union Hunt.  Will the Minister meet these people who are Irish people?  The Ward Union Hunt may have started out in the 1850s with British aristocrats but the majority of the members of the hunt comprise ordinary Irish men and women and young people.  They deserve to be able to put their case to the Minister.  There is no reason the Minister would not afford them the opportunity to meet him and for him to put his concerns to them.  If he has concerns, he has the right to put questions on animal welfare or, if he suspects any, animal cruelty to them.  Will the Minister give this House the opportunity to consider an assessment and revisit this matter towards the end of the year?

Mar chuid den chlár Rialtais, tá an Bille seo i measc go leor rudaí eile atá aontaithe le déanamh ag an Rialtas agus sin an chúis go dtacaím leis.All of us who signed up to the programme for Government may have issues with items along the way but it is the nature of politics to arrive at the most practicable, workable and broadly based compromise.  This Bill is one aspect of that and it is quite short.  In that regard, the discussion must reflect that the Bill comprises five paragraphs and is quite limited.I hope we can get back to dealing with the issues most people outside this House probably want us to deal with in terms off ostaíocht, rialú ceart na mbanc, caomhnú fuinnimh, an córas taistil, pleanáil ceart agus go leor rudaí eile lena bhfuil an Comhaontas Glas ag plé agus ar a bhfuil sé ag obair go tréan.  Ina measc tá cosaint na ndaoine is boichte sa tír, talmhaíocht, gnó bia, an córas sláinte agus córas tinnis, truailliú, cumarsáid, foraoiseacha, an comhshaol, scolaíocht agus cúram leanaí.  Tá a lán ábhair idir lámha ag an Rialtas seo agus ag Airí Glasa agus ag an Comhaontas Glas i gcoitinne.  This is but one.Even in areas where this is quite hotly debated, such as Garristown in north County Dublin which Deputy Kennedy and I represent, tonight most people there are probably more concerned with their water being cut off at 6 p.m. until 8 a.m. and having to depend on a couple of water tankers.That said, let us deal with this matter in the way that it must be dealt with because it is outstanding.  It has gone to the courts.  The Minister tried to regulate it, as Deputy Higgins suggested, but unfortunately that did not go down too well and it ended up in the High Court.  It comes down to a difficulty in trying to make progress on this.  The Bill takes the live quarry out of the equation in a hunt but does not ban hunting.  Drag hunts will continue and traditions, kennels, horsemanship and the fallen animal service do not require a stag to be part of the equation.  This reality needs to be discussed.I live in north County Dublin and I know many of the people who ride out with the WUH.  However, the majority of those who raised this issue with me are opposed to the activity for a number of reasons, many of which relate to animal welfare.  There is no getting away from that.  The Irish Farmers’ Journal printed a report in 2007 of a deer choking to death.  In 2005 a deer died having broken a rib leading to an aortic rupture.  The stress endured by the animals must be acknowledged.  A 300 kg stag aged five bolted through a hedge and was hit by a car last December and that gave us a salient warning.  Thank God there were no human fatalities but the deer had to be put down.These issues cannot be brushed under the carpet as if everything is a picnic and there is no animal welfare issue.  We must not be blind to it.  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for food and horticulture, I have met many people with an agricultural background who are not at all happy.  Horticulturists find it difficult to make a living and they do not want horses and hounds traversing their land.  I live near a farmer who has a field of turnips.  The gate was left open by the hunt members.  Generally they disregard the difficulties people face in trying to make ends meet and to maintain their livelihoods.  We must have consideration for the wider community in this regard.Condensing the issue down to wide open fields and rural communities does not tell the full story.  I recounted an incident earlier to Deputy Kennedy of a stag appearing in a man's garden while he worked in his house.  Nobody was chasing it but it was distressed having escaped the hunt at least momentarily.  A veterinarian was called and the stag had to be tranquilised.  The tranquiliser did not take effect immediately and because this large animal was agitated, it took off again towards Rivervalley, a highly built up area in Swords.  The tranquiliser only kicked in when the stag had made it 2.5 miles down the Brackenstown Road.  When a stag is trying to escape, it will try to do anything.  It will go into a school yard, the grounds of a church, a graveyard or a garden.  It will do whatever it has to do to escape.  That is the reality in the name of the WUH.I hope Fine Gael and the Labour Party will reflect on the position they are taking.

Let it be on their conscience that they did not put an end to that risk when they had an opportunity.  I regard that as irresponsible.  I hope we can pass this legislation quickly and we can move on with the weightier issues of State, which must be dealt with for the country to prosper.

I always knew the time would come.  With regard to Deputy Sargent's contribution, the people of north County Dublin might be worrying which way the Meath flag is flying on Sunday evening but whatever happens, happens.  The six Members from County Meath will travel to Croke Park together on Sunday to shout for our team and before we leave, we will join up with our Dublin counterparts who have joined us in Meath.  We love the number of Dublin people who have moved to our county.  They brought their wit, culture and so on but I have not been contacted by one of them since this debate started two or three years ago asking me to stop my way of life.I could be emotional about this issue but I am clear about it.  I can also be risen easily but when one knows one is right and there is compromise at the end of the day, it is easy to speak.  I was elected to the House in a by-election by people from different walks of life and people of different political persuasions.  Almost 2,000 Fianna Fáil supporters gave me a first preference.  Labour Party, Green Party, Sinn Féin and Independent supporters gave me their lower preferences and I am here to represent all of them.Two years ago when the issue raised its head, there was a struggle and the Minister implemented regulations.  Within six months, members of the WUH were happy they were implemented because they made it easier for them and it worked out well.  I could not believe my ears when I heard we were back to this again because I am a person who believes in live and let live.  We should respect each other's culture and each other's party.  I could make great hay in my county about this issue, as my party colleague said, but I will not because that would be a short-term reaction.  The six Members from County Meath are all of the one type and I am under no illusions that we are in the House on behalf of the people.  I keep in contact with my people.  Sometimes I must make up my own mind on the spur of the moment like I did last night with two Members from Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party regarding an amendment to another Bill where common sense worked at the end of the day.  I guarantee common sense will prevail next Tuesday evening.  There is a great deal of common sense in the Green Party.I support the Green Party on one issue.  I do not support it on a lot of things and I did not vote with it the first night I was in the Dáil.  I left the House, even though its Members were on this side of the House, because I was not clear on the issue.  Anything I knew about the Green Party told me that its agenda was not in the interest of County Meath at the time.  However, there is one thing in County Meath in which I have an interest — that is, the opening of Panda, where there is recycling instead of incineration.  It was one of the best days I had since I was elected and I know it was one of the best days the Minister had.There is no one better than me to throw muck, as Deputies know.  Sometimes one does not like doing it, but one needs to.  Deputy Mansergh said I was biased and he is right.  I was taught to fight fire with fire.  That is the only way it can be done.  We can beat around the bush as much as we like, but when I am hit with fire I hit back with fire.  Ultimately, we will all need to come back here and talk about far more important issues.  This is needlessly bringing us down.I know the Green Party has its issues about animals.  Those who hunt are great people — I have listened to them.  I know these people, who are of a farming background.  Contrary to what Deputy Kennedy said — although I will not get annoyed about it — they are true Irishmen.  There is not an ounce of English blood in them.  They are not gentry; I know them.  They are true Irishmen.  I did not like that comment.

I was at an environmental meeting and I found it hard to accept that people in the industry were not consulted.  That is a fact and it is on the record.  It is not right.  Deputies Higgins and Broughan are correct; this measure will be challenged.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party do not want to have to reintroduce stag hunting when Fianna Fáil and the Green Party leave Government, whether it is now or in two years' time.  We do not want to have to spend time on that.  However, we will bring it back in.  That is guaranteed.  The Green Party has a lot of good ideas.  If it wants the trust of the Irish people, it must ask why it ended up with no councillors.

Its rural Deputies know, when they walk in here next week, that they must face their fate.  That is where RISE comes in.  Rural Ireland did not allow the Ward Union Hunt to be hung out to dry.Hunting is a pursuit that is an escape from ordinary life, similar to fishing, Gaelic football, soccer or badminton.  When things get tough, one has a pursuit at the weekend.  We have open battle on Sundays.  More blood will be spilled in Croke Park on Sunday than in the next ten stag hunts — that is for sure.  That is the way it will be.

I ask him to listen to what I am saying.  What is another year?  Let it be right.  Why put these people out of a pastime?  I know how hard they work.  Their children get up in the morning and look after their ponies.  It is their way out from drugs and everything else.  It is hard enough.  I come into Dublin and I see cruelty.  I walk down the street every day and give every penny I have in my pocket to those poor people.I cannot accept the Bill that the Green Party is introducing.  The principle is right, but it should not isolate one group of people.  Up to last Wednesday, everybody accepted everybody.  The Thirty-two Counties accepted each other.  Next Tuesday we will cause a divide, and that is wrong.  One part of the community, which is 150 years old and pure Irish, will be isolated.  The industry provides jobs and keeps kids off the street.  I am asking the Minister to draw back, and I will continue to ask him up to the last minute on Tuesday evening, because I believe in democracy and in doing the right thing.  I know the Green Party will do it and I know my colleagues in Fianna Fáil will do it.  They must do the right thing.In politics, one must do the right thing and one is there to represent people.  I represent the people of Meath, regardless of their politics or sporting pursuits.  Deputies have seen over the last six months how political a country we are when things are tough.  The Government knows we supported its side on the night the bank guarantee was introduced.  Let us be right or let us be wrong — we know what is ahead of us.  We must not interfere with sport and with a way of life.  The Government may wish to get this over quickly, but it will be the longest drawn out battle of all time.  The Green Party will have no support from the Government.  It is the only thing it will get done.  There are many Green Party issues that must be addressed.Two years ago a letter was sent which stated that pack hounds would not be included in the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, but it was not true.  It was a broken promise.  Why should anyone trust the Green Party Members a second time?  I trust them to do the right thing, as I trust every person elected in this House to do the right thing in the interests of the people who elected him or her.Deputy Sargent is right when he says we should not be spending our time on this.  We did not bring it up; I thought it was dealt with.  We must act responsibly in situations such as this.  There are many things in my party that I am not happy with and that I would like to bring up, but one must take it bit by bit and prioritise.The banning of the Ward Union hunt when the country is on its knees in debt is appalling.  There was a man in my office the other day who had been buying the cheapest possible food for himself because he had four children who were home for the summer.  Yet here we are talking about removing €1.3 million from the County Meath economy.  The Green Party has its principles, which I respect, but it should not destroy people's way of life.  That is what it is doing.Why has RISE succeeded?  It is because the hunting men, the fishing men and the shooting men simply do not believe the Green Party.

I ask Deputy Sargent to listen, because if he does not then not only will the Green Party lose all its councillors but when the next election comes it will be more extinct than the stag.  There will not be a Green Party Deputy in the House.  Any Fianna Fáil Deputy who walks with the Green Party Deputies is narrowing his or her chances too.  I accept it is up to those in my constituency to nominate me; I have been in politics since I was 14 years of age.  If my party members do not want me to run I will not run.  If they want me to put up posters I will do so.  However, I will listen to them and I will do what I am told, up to a point, although I will have a mind of my own.I will finish on this note.  The Green Party has lost all its councillors because the people did not trust it.  It is all down to votes.  The Deputies should be in no doubt about that.  If they want to implement more of their policies they should show that they have an ability to compromise.  They should not be single-minded, as the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, said about me.  I am more single-minded, but ultimately I have an ability to compromise a little.  Each of the Deputies has also.  They should go back and think about it for three months over the summer.  They can get all the organisations together, sit down and sort it out.  If they railroad the Bill through, it will be no good to anybody.The Green Party in government will be remembered as the party that banned the stag hunt.  That will be the end of the story.  Fianna Fáil will not back the Greens any more; its members have said so now.  They will back the Greens in nothing and there are still two years left to go for this Government.  I predict it will last two years but nothing will be achieved by the Greens.I am a backbencher and that is why I am sitting here all day.  I do not always listen to what the front benchers say; I am going to fight my corner and they know that.  We come out and we come out united.  I am asking all the Green Party Deputies to go back and talk to Deputy Johnny Brady, Deputy Mary Wallace, Deputy Thomas Byrne and Deputy Noel Dempsey.  They are their partners in government.  I urge them to come up with a compromise and throw out this Bill.  We will come back in the middle of July if we have to.  I urge the Minister not to railroad this Bill down our throats.  That is all I am asking and I will give a greater warning.  They should not railroad this Bill down our throats or they will have no party and Fianna Fáil will have a lot fewer Deputies because the people in RISE come from Donegal to the end of Kerry.  A total of 9,700 people — voters — in my constituency have signed up to support RISE.  That number is a quota on its own.  As I said in Simonstown last night, I do not want that.  I want my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, whose supporters are in the Public Gallery, to get them to do the right thing, to do what is good for County Meath and not to look for some short-term gain.  The Green Party would have support in County Meath.  I ask them to open their minds and not to be so god-damned narrow-minded about everything.  This is a country of 4.5 million people and that population will build up to 6.5 million within 30 years when we will need food, electricity and a lot of green agendas.  I urge the Green Party Deputies not to end up like their councillors on the scrap heap because that is the bottom line.  These are the facts.  The reporters are here and they can write about it.  The facts are that the Green Party has no councillors and it will have no TDs if its Deputies do not listen to people.  They will bring people along with them if they listen to them.How much time have I remaining, Acting Chairman?

As I said two years ago, we came in and we fought and it was hot and heavy.  I was delighted with the Minister.  A system was set up.  It cost a few pounds but everything was regularised and it worked very well.  There were no complaints.  I remind the House there were no children in the schoolyard the day the stag broke in.  That is a case of being hit by a bus when there is no bus.I remind the House that 30,000 deer are illegally killed every year.  Who is killing them?  Is it the gun clubs of County Meath or County Waterford or County Kerry?  Is it the fishermen?  If I am wrong in those figures, I stand to be corrected because that information was given to me but one cannot always be right in everything.  However, there is a large number of deer killed illegally in this country.  Does the Minister of State not think they are the ones that should be looked after in an animal welfare Bill?  I think they are.I know all the people involved in the Ward Union Hunt and in other hunts.  They are all farming-minded people, so to speak.  As Deputy Michael Kennedy said, he was not a farming person but these people are all animal lovers.  They would stay up at night to mind a calf that was born two months premature.  They would get up ten times at night to make sure it lived.  They would do it for any animal.  They are not cruel people and I resent that insinuation from anybody.  The sport has been regularised and the Minister has done a good job in that regard.  The vets have done a good job.  Why not just leave things alone and leave the people alone?  The Green Party is getting people's backs up.  A total of 300,000 people are up in arms.  The names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mails addresses of all those people are now on a system.  That makes a total of 30 quotas in an election.  The Minister of State knows what we are all like in elections; we can be nice fellows but it is votes we want.I say to the Green Party and to my five colleagues, including Deputy Damien English, I expect us to stand together on Tuesday night but I also expect in the meantime that the north County Dublin Deputies — I will not name them — and my colleagues in County Meath, will sit down with the Green Party, somewhere, not the Green Isle Hotel, but somewhere else, to sort this out and to come back on Tuesday or the week after.  It is the right thing to do and many of the Green Party members know it is the right thing to do.There are too many arguments when a subject is raised. I was gung-ho when it came to the Road Traffic Bill, as was the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey and Deputy Broughan but we saw common sense during the day yesterday and we amended the Bill in the House, in the interest, as I said, of fair play.  All I am asking for is fair play on behalf of these people who work so hard from one year to the next, who mind their stock, who work in offices, who are plumbers or carpenters or farm labourers or shopkeepers.  They all go out together, they have their bit of fun, they mind their horses, they do nothing that will do harm to these stags.I thought I would not have anything to say in this debate, having listened to Deputy Wallace, Deputy Brady and Deputy Byrne but there was one little thing they did not get right: they said they would be voting with the Government.  That is the only part they did not say right.  They know the consequences.  Deputy Johnny Brady put it very well.  If Members think I am passionate about this matter, he is twice as passionate.  I have seen him standing on a box outside mass 30 years ago and he would put the hair standing on one's head when talking about Fianna Fáil; so much so, I would nearly join it myself.  What he said in the debate was right.  Deputy Michael Kennedy was right.  He advised them to sit down between now and next Tuesday.  It should not be the case that people are coming up from Cork and Kerry.  We should not be fighting among ourselves in the House because we have far too many issues to discuss.  I am asking the people opposite to talk.  I know the Minister of State is a hunting woman.  I ask her to give the lead, as a Carlow Deputy.  She knows what it means. If an agreement is not possible, then so be it, but at least they should try.  That is all I have to say.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I wish to share my time with Deputy Paul Gogarty.I thank Deputy McEntee.  I come from a rural background and I am pleased to have a few minutes to say that I am alive and well as a rural Deputy representing Carlow-Kilkenny.  Some of the information coming from RISE has been totally disingenuous.  Its members have disregarded my democratic mandate; they have disregarded my very existence; they have disregarded the fact that I used to hunt.I used to have a little pony called Lucky, when I had little yellow plaits.  I used to follow the Bray Harriers when I was ten.  Then I grew up.  My father could not afford the pony — he used to rent them from Delahunt's stables in County Wicklow — but my sister and I loved ponies.  We loved the rural way of life.  I live under the Blackstairs mountains in County Carlow.  I am great friends with many members of the Carlow Farmers Hunt and I support them on many of their fund-raising activities.  There are two sad aspects to this debate.  One is the completely erroneous statements from RISE about the origins of the Green Party's policy on this issue, the completely erroneous statements that the Greens know nothing about rural Ireland.  I know a lot about rural Ireland.  I was brought up in rural Ireland, I married somebody from rural Ireland and I live in rural Ireland.  For many years, I used to shoot and fish to feed my family.  I know what it is like to hook a salmon.  I know what it is like to shoot a pheasant.  However, the countryside has changed in Meath and in north County Dublin; it has become increasingly urbanised.  Deputy McEntee knows this and he spoke very passionately and honestly and I respect that.  However, he must also respect my views that the Green Party members are aware of how the countryside ticks.  We do not all live in the middle of cities such as Cork, Dublin or Galway, where we have elected members.  Some of us live and breathe the country air and know how the country works.The Labour Party has executed a complete volte face and it is now deciding to vote against this Bill.  The Labour Party supported it and many of its Deputies, whether it was Deputy Rabbitte or Deputy Gilmore, were against stag hunting.  Now the party has done a complete 180 degrees turn.It may have made that turn because of the pick and mix politics in which it now engages or because of the very comfortable position it holds on most of its policies — sitting on the fence.Many people watch hunting sitting on the fence because they like the colour and glamour of the hunt as it passes.  However, Labour Party policy now is a policy of sitting on the fence, which is a very comfortable place to be.  However, it is about time the Labour Party members came off the fence and told us where they stand, rather than watching the polls and tick-tacking to see which way the wind blows.  It is very interesting that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council moved a motion calling on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to honour his commitment to outlaw stag hunting and to cease immediately providing licences for the purpose of carrying out stag hunts.  This motion was passed in Deputy Gilmore's constituency.We must be genuine in our debates here.  I will be genuine and recognise Members' genuine concerns.  However, we have not talked about the genuine concerns of people who had near fatal accidents as a result of stag hunting by the Ward Union hunt.  We are all aware of the incident where the stag went into Kildalkey school yard.  We heard about it and saw the photograph of the little children with their faces pressed against the classroom windows as they looked out terrified as the stag came into the school yard.  We are also aware of the incident that occurred before Christmas where a stag jumped onto the bonnet of a car, which nearly had disastrous consequences.  We know too about a gardener — a friend of mine and of Deputy Trevor Sargent — into whose garden a stag entered when the hunt chased it.This issue passes all political boundaries.  It is an issue of safety and we should recognise that and that the urban environment is increasingly encroaching on the countryside of both Deputy McEntee's constituency and the constituency of Dublin North.  I gave up shooting and fishing because the countryside has changed.  If I am having a go at the Labour Party, I am doing it with scientific facts.  There is hardly a fish in our rivers now.  We have catch and release for salmon and some rivers are still closed.  The reason this is the case is because when Deputy Gilmore was Minister of State, he legalised monofilament drift netting.  We are still suffering from that decision in the great riverine constituency I represent, with the Nore, the Barrow and the Slaney.  This is the reason also that tourism is falling.  People used to come here to fish but because monofilament drift netting was legalised, we lost billions in revenue.  We are still losing billions because of these walls of death in our sea capturing salmon and almost causing them to become extinct.The issue we are debating today is an issue that goes beyond party politics.  It is an issue of safety.  If I or any reasonable person had a daughter in Kildalkey school on the day the stag entered the yard, we would have asked why it was deer could run into the yard or over car bonnets and cause distress to local people.  We have not addressed the issue of animal welfare either.  I attended a meeting recently in the Royal College of Physicians at which a vet spoke about the distress caused to the deer.  I know the Deputy said the deer is only carted out once every so often and is then returned to its place in Meath.  However, the vet told me and hundreds of others at the meeting that there is huge stress on the animal.  Therefore, we must talk about animal welfare and about man as a thinking being with control over animals under his care.  Is it right that he gets pleasure from the hunt?Perhaps we should have a philosophical discussion on whether we get pleasure out of causing fear and anxiety to animals.  Perhaps people do not think about that, but only about the thrill of the chase.  The stag is a farmed animal whose antlers have been cut off.  When the stag is cornered with the hounds at bay, grown men jump on the stag, bring it to the ground and wrestle it back into the horsebox.  Man is a sentient being with a higher mind than an animal.  Is it right for him to take pleasure in this?  That is what is at the heart of this Bill.  The issue is not jobs or pleasure, but about man as a superior being having control over animals.  This is the philosophical question.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	487	It is a philosophical debate whether man takes pleasure from causing pain to a lower being.  That is the question we must ask.  This Bill is being introduced to ensure we protect animal welfare and an increasingly urbanised environment in the area represented by the Deputy.  In picking Meath County Council as one of the councils for a review of planning practice, the Minister shows he is conscious of the extensive nature of over-rezoning and planning in that area.  This fleshes out my argument.  Meath has become completely urbanised in parts and the hunt has the capability to drive a stag into that urban environment.  That is not good.As a person who understands the countryside well and who was brought up in the countryside, I used to follow the Bray harriers.  I used to fish, but now there are no fish in the rivers.  I used to shoot, but my local environment has changed and because of climate change and the fact the bogs have been drained, the wild birds such as woodcock, pheasant and snipe are no longer there.  Let no person from Rural Ireland Says Enough, RISE, tell me I do not understand the countryside because I do.  Let no person from RISE tell me this Bill is the thin edge of the wedge.  It is not.  There is nothing in the programme for Government that will put a stop to fishing or shooting, and the Deputy knows that.  This Bill is not part of some salami slicing agenda that the people in RISE, Fine Gael or the Labour Party want to latch on to.  This is a simple Bill to protect the people of north Dublin and to protect animals.I appreciate the concerns of Deputy McEntee, who spoke from the heart.  I speak as a practical countrywoman who was elected by the people of Carlow-Kilkenny and who knew the Green Party policies when the people elected me to this House with their votes.  I have no fear about the future.  The people will either reject me or return me, but I must be honest with myself.  As a country person, I know how the countryside ticks.  I find it despicable of RISE not to take into account where I come from as a rural Deputy.  I am happy to point out that Mr. Mike Bailey and the Labour Party are now in the same tent as they are both on the one side.

She suggests it is a Bill that will cover up areas where we have not achieved.  I do not intend to spend too long on that argument because it is laughable.We have made achievements, particularly following the programme for Government negotiations of 2009.  Deputy Tuffy asked what was the difference between our achievements of 2007 and of 2009.  The simple answer is mathematics.  In 2007, the Green Party was not absolutely required and we had less of an input.  However, we decided to enter Government anyway in order to achieve what we could.  That was the right thing to do rather than hurl from the ditch.  There was, of course, an alternative.  We are all aware of the story of how Deputy Kenny rang my colleague, Deputy Sargent, and asked him to talk to Sinn Féin.  That was done, but a couple of years later he denied it and basically accused me and Deputy Sargent of lying.  I am speaking about "honest Enda" as he has been described by some of his colleagues.  We know there could have been an alternative, but there was not.The only alternative, therefore, was Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.  The mathematics mattered in 2009 and because the Green Party numbers had a more relative import then, we had more clout in the programme for Government negotiations.  Therefore, we achieved more in areas such as sustainable measures to deal with the impact of climate change, widening the tax base, protecting the education budget at a time of economic recession, stopping the reintroduction of third level fees, creating new green jobs and cleaning up the planning mess caused over many years among the larger parties.  In addition to these legislative achievements, we also took tough, but necessary and unpopular decisions to sort out a mess that was not of our own making.

It has nothing to do with popularity.  Deputy Tuffy also asserted that this legislation was an attempt to save a seat or two for the Green Party but again, this is baloney.  Deputy Tuffy lives a couple of doors away from me and I am sure she will testify directly or under a lie detector that were she asked about me specifically, she would acknowledge that rarely if ever has she seen any reference to animal rights in my leaflets.  I talk about dodgy planning by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  I talk about school infrastructure, the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and issues within the community.  I do not talk about animal rights, even though it is something about which I am passionate, because my constituents, to be honest, are not that concerned about it.

I have never included anything about animal rights on my leaflets because I work for my community.  This is all about doing the right thing.  It may cost me votes.  I will not gain a single vote for standing up for animal rights but may lose a few for so doing.  While I may lose the votes of those who do not wish this legislation to be passed, it will not gain any votes for me.  However, it is the right thing to do, which is the reason I support it.Unfortunately, in this instance the Labour Party, if Members pardon a pun that may have been used earlier, appears to be running with the hare and hunting with the hounds.  I used to believe the Labour Party had principles and I know this used to be the case.  Deputy Tuffy is someone for whom I have great admiration and she certainly has principles.  I question the decisions by some Labour Party members, such as the example provided by Deputy White of the introduction of monofilament drift netting by the then Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore.  My favourite is the introduction of incineration by Deputy Stagg, as well as the votes in favour of the Ringsend incinerator in the Dublin regional waste management plan by Labour Party councillors, among others.  Despite this, poor old Deputy Gormley now receives all the harangues and harassment about the subject although its introduction was not his fault.

However, many bad ones were made.  For instance, in the home of the Mullingar accord, enough land was rezoned to last until 2083, which constitutes bad planning.  Similarly, it is bad planning when Deputy Gormley has been obliged to reverse decisions made by councillors across the country because they are creating unsustainable communities.

Had he been in power with the Green Party in a left-leaning alliance, he would have managed to ban stag hunting outright.  However, he was in coalition with Fine Gael and so he did what he could.  The Green Party is in coalition with Fianna Fáil and I make no apologies for doing what we can to implement Green Party policy as befits the mandate we are given by the people.  I respect those who work to achieve what they can based on what they know to be right and to take the flak when they are obliged to make what might be an unfair decision, albeit for the right reasons.However, new Labour in particular is not like that.  It now appears to be the stand-for-nothing party.  It is the party that offends no one and which avoids offending its trade union donors or potential new rural voters.  It will share common cause with the Bailey brothers if that means turning into a rural catch-all party like Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  Deputy Tuffy stated that this legislation would divide communities and that we need rural and urban to work together to pull the economy forward.While tourism is a great way to bring people together and to pull them forward, the tourism industry has been decimated because of bad and dodgy decisions.  As for the issue of jobs and the influence of the Ward Union Hunt this issue does not pertain to jobs.  It is about the boys on top of the horses not being willing to drag hunt.  They are not willing to lay down a scent for the hounds to follow as they can do everything else with the arrangement of the farmers.  However, they want to cause wanton cruelty and to engender dread in the stag.  There is no other reason for it because they can do everything else.  They can dress up in their finery; they can lord it over every field and can pee off some of the farmers who do not wish them to go across their land.  However, they do not wish to do this if they are dragging a scent.  They want to have the fun implicit in scaring the bejasus out of a dumb animal.  I say that they, and not the stags, are the dumb animals in this instance.Many proud rural traditions have been stopped over the years.  Several hundred years ago, although some chauvinists among Members might call for its reintroduction, a woman who scolded a man could be dumped into the river.  That legislation was only repealed in the United Kingdom in 1967.  Although it was a proud tradition in many communities that a woman who spoke up for herself could be sorted out, that now has gone.  I acknowledge this is a frivolous argument.  However, in respect of the issue of female genital mutilation, which has been mentioned previously in the media, a much sorrier tradition is being carried on.  One is accused of being an imperialist Westerner when one dares to suggest that this is a cruel and abhorrent practice.  The same sort of cultural imperialism message, to paraphrase Edward Said, is coming across in this spurious rural-urban argument to the effect that somehow, anyone who suggests it might be wrong to treat an animal cruelly is purely a jackeen who knows nothing about rural issues.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13714	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I appreciate the time yielded to me by Fine Gael on this issue.  In the short time available to me, I do not intend to go into some of the comments I have just heard.  I have no intention of personalising this issue even though people have referred to me and to my colleagues.  In the view of the Labour Party, the bottom line is whether this legislation is necessary at present, whether it is purely politically motivated or whether it is based on true animal welfare.  In 2007, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, issued a licence to the Ward Union Hunt on which, unless I am mistaken, he placed 27 conditions.  In 2008, he issued a licence to the Ward Union Hunt on which 34 conditions were placed.  In 2009, he issued a licence to the Ward Union Hunt, unless I am mistaken, on which he placed 35 conditions.If one speaks to the rights of man, common sense or a man's motivation, if at that time, he as Minister issued a licence for that hunt to proceed, surely that includes a tacit understanding that he recognised its right to exist as a hunt?

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	521	The National Sports Campus Development Authority, NSCDA, took over the role and function of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, on 1 January 2007 and a fully owned subsidiary of the authority, NSCDA (Operations) Limited, now operates the National Aquatic Centre.This matter relates to the previous operation of the National Aquatic Centre by Dublin Waterworld, DWW.  A lease was signed between CSID and DWW on 30 April 2003.  However, the tenant failed to comply with its obligations under the lease and this necessitated CSID to initiate legal proceedings against DWW in March 2005.  These proceedings were initiated following advice received from the Office of the Attorney General which was in accord with the advice provided to CSID by its legal advisers.  Accordingly, in February 2005, the Department wrote to CSID stating that it considered that it was not acceptable to allow the tenant to renege on the terms of the lease any longer and, therefore, it was necessary to enforce the rights of CSID under the terms of the lease.  CSID issued an immediate notice to quit on DWW as well as a notice of forfeiture. A trial commenced in the High Court in July 2005 and concluded in November 2005.  In November 2006, the High Court confirmed an earlier order of possession of the centre in favour of CSID, and the facility was handed back to CSID on 1 December 2006.Among the outstanding obligations under the lease was the payment of VAT of €10,254,600.  When the lease on the National Aquatic Centre was signed this VAT amount became due.  CSID was liable for this amount and DWW was invoiced but failed to pay the amount.  The failure to comply with the obligation to pay the VAT amount was included in the statement of claim against DWW.  The High Court ordered that the VAT issue should be referred to arbitration.  On 1 July 2005, the arbitrator found "that the amount of VAT of €10,254,600 charged by CSID on the capitalised value of the lease to DWW was correctly charged".  At the commencement of the High Court proceedings on 26 July 2005, DWW challenged the arbitration award.  The judgment given on 26 September 2005 upheld the arbitrator's finding.The High Court judgment was appealed to the Supreme Court by DWW and the case was heard on 26 January 2010.  Judgment in the case was delivered on 30 April 2010.  The Supreme Court held that the arbitrator's award had to be set aside as a number of fundamental errors of law had been made by the arbitrator.  In the court's view the arbitrator made an error in allowing CSID to use the formulae then available for calculating the capitalised value of the lease on the National Aquatic Centre.  The court also held that the valuation provided by the Valuation Office was in the nature of evidence and should have been taken into account by the arbitrator.  I understand that the NSCDA is considering the outcome of the Supreme Court judgment and I await further communication from the authority in this regard.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	522	The subject of my ten to 15 questions to the Department was not the dispute between CSID and Dublin Waterworld, it was about the pursuit of the VAT issue on which the legal advice from both the Attorney General and the Comptroller and Auditor General is clear.  They agreed that Dublin Waterworld was not liable for the payment of VAT and, therefore, the Department or CSID should not pursue the matter, yet the matter was pursued and as we know, ultimately, the case was lost in the Supreme Court.My question is how much it cost.  Have any calculations been done in that regard?  The Minister has had fair warning in terms of the number of questions I submitted on the cost of legal fees.  I do not know whether the defendant's costs were awarded against the Department or if a settlement was made.  The case has dragged on for six or seven years.  It is not cheap to bring a case as far as the Supreme Court.  I presume the costs are significant.  I would like to know how much they are.I would also like to know how the decision was made to ignore the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Attorney General.  The Minister indicated that the NSCDA is considering its position but it was reported in the newspaper that the parties were going back to arbitration, that the authority is not giving up even yet and will continue to pursue the matter despite the fact that the advice has not changed and the facts remain the same.The Minister is as well aware as I am of how short money is at the moment.  We spoke this morning about the nonsense of public bodies wasting public money in vendettas.  I do not know whether this is a vendetta or if it was a rush of blood to the head, a political row or just bad judgment but this happened for some reason and I would like to know why and how much it has cost the taxpayer to date.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	523	A final figure is not yet available but I understand that to the end of last year the only money that has been paid out is €141,741 in connection with the proceedings to recover the outstanding VAT charge.  I hasten to add that the expenditure is by the National Sports Campus Development Authority, not the Department.  The amount does not include the costs incurred in the Supreme Court hearing, which have yet to be advised.  I am sure one can add another significant sum to the figure indicated.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	524	What was the €141,741 spent on?

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Does it include the High Court costs?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	527	Yes.  That is the advice I received in that regard but additional money will be required taking account of the High Court appeal.  I have taken a briefing on the advice that was given and looked through the order of letter and advices that were given.  The last correspondence from the Department to Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited indicates that it was seeking the advice of the Attorney General.  In a letter from March 2005 the Department confirmed that a claim for the unpaid VAT and the lease should be included in any proceedings that had to be issued following service of the forfeiture notice and that this was advised by the Office of the Attorney General.  Earlier correspondence stated that the Comptroller and Auditor General said it was not worth pursuing and that the Attorney General was inclined towards that advice but that in the context of a statement of claim being made in regard to a number of different issues where the lease was being breached, it was advised that then the VAT was also being included in that statement of claim.  It was stated that this was advised by the Office of the Attorney General.  It is not correct to say that the NSCDA went against the advice that was given at the time.On the third question on what will happen now, I am not aware that the NSCDA has indicated it is going to arbitration.  Its view is that it should not go back to arbitration but that it is checking out the situation in regard to Revenue.  A final, formal decision has not been made in that regard.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	528	In respect of the money that will have to be paid out in legal costs, we do not have any idea of how much it cost the Department in time, energy and whatever else was expended.  We were told an operational subsidy for the National Aquatic Centre would always be necessary although it was built on the assumption that it would not be.  Is it now anticipated that the legal costs will have to be borne by the Department or in a subsidy paid by the Department to the National Aquatic Centre or has there been any discussion about how costs will be carried?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Unfortunately, there has been too much expenditure on legal costs within various sporting bodies and organisations in recent years.  There is no doubt that the money is coming from the sport it is meant to be supporting.  The same is true in the case in question.  Most swimming pools throughout the country tend to lose money so a subsidy will undoubtedly be needed for the National Aquatic Centre.  In fairness to it, it is now ranked as the fourth most popular paying visitor attraction in the country.  I am sure the Deputy has visited it.  It is a spectacular place and is quite successful.  In 2009, there were 724,000 visitors.  I recently visited it when the American juniors' team was competing there.  It is a very successful entity.  The more success it has, the better it will be in that it will require an increasingly small subsidy.  In so far as the money will have to come from somewhere, I presume it will have to come from any subvention the Department would make to it.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	530	That is a sorry state of affairs.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The development of a national sports facilities strategy and an audit of local sports facilities were commitments made by the last Government.  Before commencing work on the strategy and audit, an expenditure review of the sports capital programme was undertaken.  This was designed to assess the benefits that the investment had yielded to date and to identify any difficulties or inefficiencies associated with the operation of the programme.The report of that expenditure review is available on my Department's website.  Following the publication of the review, an inter-agency steering group was established to oversee the development of the strategy.  This group comprised representatives from several Departments, the Irish Sports Council, the National Sports Campus Development Authority and the County and City Managers Association.  As part of its work, it consulted a wide range of stakeholders and also considered existing national and international reports, studies and strategies relating to the provision of sports facilities.A draft national sports facilities strategy for 2010-15 has been completed within my Department and was circulated to a number of Departments and other relevant bodies for observations prior to finalisation.  The draft strategy has been amended to take account of the comments received and I expect to receive the revised strategy shortly for my consideration.The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local levels and to ensure a co-ordinated approach across the various agencies and Departments involved in supporting the provision of sport and recreational facilities.  It aims to prioritise areas for future investment and will provide an improved policy platform for any future rounds of the sports capital programme.  Any future rounds of funding will also be informed by the national audit of sports facilities that is currently being finalised.Phase 1 of the audit focused on national and regional sports facilities and has been completed.  Phase 2 involves the compilation of a list of facilities at local level, which is a more complex undertaking.  Phase 2 commenced in 2008 with the assistance of local authorities in conjunction with an audit of arts facilities and an audit of community facilities that was being undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The returns received from local authorities have been collated into a database of over 6,000 records and are currently being cross-checked against the Department's sports capital programme records.  The mapping of the records has begun.  The outcome of the audit will assist in identifying gaps in sports facilities and will, therefore, provide valuable information for any future rounds of sports capital funding.The sports policy unit of my Department has responsibility for a number of areas of work including the national sports facilities strategy and the audit of existing facilities.  One member of staff in this unit is involved with these projects, in addition to other areas of responsibility within the sports policy area.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I thank the Minister for her reply.  I welcome the strategy.  It is important that we compile all the information.  The strategy has been in gestation since 2002, which is a very long time.  Circumstances have been changing since then and I presume the strategy is being kept up to date.  It needs to be published.  When can we expect to see it?There have been review groups, oversight groups, drafts, audits, amendments and revisions but we need to see the document and to be assured that any future rounds of capital funding will be based on the audit.The Minister will be aware of a recent "Prime Time" programme that showed sports funding was less than transparent.  An article in The Irish Times states:In sports funding, the powerful are the Minister for sport and the Minister for Finance. Clubs in their constituencies receive more money in total, receive a greater amount per application, are more likely to make successful applications, and more likely to have more successful applications than others.Overall, clubs in the Minister for Finance's constituency can expect to receive more than €70,000 in funding, compared with €63,700 elsewhere. Over €1 million in additional funding is made available to the constituency of the minister for sport and the minister for finance each year, or €2.5 million, compared with €1.5 million elsewhere.This is what has been happening and these are the facts and the established information.  The journalists were able to package this information and draw conclusions from it.  We are waiting a long time for the strategy that will enable us all to see what is available and what gaps exist.  We need a timeframe now.  We had reviews, drafts and revisions but we now need the document.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	533	The Deputy raised a couple of points.  I accept the need for the strategy.  It will guide our thinking on any future sports capital programme.  We are not sure as yet whether there will be another in the near future.  While the strategy will be able to map gaps geographically, I hope it will be able to map gaps in particular sports.  As I stated this morning, there are a number of areas that do not have very good boxing facilities, yet we produced five medalists at the European Senior Boxing Championships.  There are gaps, probably because the areas in question did not have the capacity to apply.  Such gaps need to be examined.The delay has been due to the fact that so much has been happening, as the Deputy outlined.  Some €730 million has been spent on the sports side.  Much was happening on the education side also.  In some cases, arrangements are being made with local clubs, as it should be.  Much was happening through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs under the RAPID programme, resulting in the development of facilities.  It is a question of an interdepartmental study and of devising a strategy based on it.  Given that the strategy has been sent to other Departments for their observations, I hope it will be submitted to me over the summer months and that we will be able to consider it even further.With regard to the "Prime Time" programme, in fairness to Deputy Upton, she put her finger on what is happening in that she stated information can be packaged in any way.  In regard to areas that are very spread out, such as north-east Donegal and south Kerry, where one must travel miles and between peninsulas, of course it will appear on paper that there is duplication.  The programme referred to expenditure in some counties.  This had to happen because that is where the population grew.  The Minister for Finance, be it the current Minister or his predecessor but one, happen to have represented or represent areas with the biggest growth in population.  Naturally investment follows population growth.  That was not taken into consideration in the programme, which just considered the matter from a political perspective and referred to Kildare and Dublin West.  These areas were where the demand was.  The strategy will guide our thinking on the provision of sports facilities.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	534	It was more than a small coincidence that for each occasion, particularly in regard to sport and leaving aside education, many of the new developments took place in the constituencies in question.  A number of swimming pools were built in certain areas whereas there is a severe shortage in certain other areas.  One area of my constituency, which I referred to this morning, urgently needs its swimming pool to be retained.  The Minister spoke about this today.  We need the strategy in place and it needs to be absolutely transparent.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	535	A national strategy is important but we must also have buy-in from the local authorities.  They must be willing not only to providing funding but also to commit to maintaining the facilities.  That is the position on swimming pools.  In respect of three disadvantaged areas of Dublin city, the council needs to be able to ensure it has a mechanism to subsidise the pools using other income, particularly because it is now applying for more funding for new pools.  It would be very wrong of it to ignore one set of constituents in order to promote a pool in another area.  I have indicated that to them.The swimming pool programme is one of our best programmes.  As I indicated this morning, 42 of the 57 have now been built.  Two further pools are going into construction this year and more are going to tender.

We really need to have that document in front of us.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I am advised, because I have not been involved in it to date because it preceded me and was moving around different Departments, that it will come to me in the next few weeks.  We will certainly try to progress it after that.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	539	After six years of successive growth — culminating in record numbers of overseas visitors in 2007 — the second half of 2008 saw a reduction in the number of overseas visitors coming to Ireland.  This trend continued in 2009.While the decrease in visitors to Ireland is disappointing, it must be understood in the context of a decline in tourist numbers internationally.  Tourism worldwide has been deeply affected by global economic difficulties and loss of consumer confidence.  To put our performance in context, OECD figures suggest that there was a higher reduction in 2009 in visitor numbers to Malta, Hungary, Cyprus, Greece and Finland, while the drop reported in France, Portugal and Spain was between 8 and 12%.The exceptional weather conditions in the first two months of this year affected not only Ireland but also most of our overseas markets, while airports were closed again in April and May due to the volcanic ash cloud.However, it is important to note that over 60% of holidaymakers normally arrive into Ireland between May and September and the industry and the tourism agencies are fighting hard for every bit of the available business for the summer and remainder of the year.A number of euro zone economies are coming out of recession and these, of course, are important source markets for Irish tourism.  Tourism Ireland is focusing on those major markets that are likely to deliver immediate returns this year, including Great Britain, Germany and the US, as research has shown these markets as our best prospects.On 6 May, I launched a €20 million summer marketing campaign on behalf of Tourism Ireland which was designed to win as much business as possible in our key target markets during the peak and shoulder season.  The new marketing drive was developed in conjunction with hundreds of tourism industry partners — hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation, self-catering establishments, cultural institutions, golf courses, visitor attractions as well as air and sea carriers — who have got behind the campaign with a range of value-for-money offers.Fáilte Ireland is also working with the industry to engage the Irish holidaymaker with attractive and accessible offers highlighting the value and quality available within Ireland.  It is encouraging that recent survey results have shown a significant increase in the number of Irish families that intend to holiday at home this year.On the business tourism front, the opening of the national convention centre in Dublin in September will further enhance our capacity to attract international events.In terms of the broader policy environment, the report of the Tourism Renewal Group published last October set out a clear plan for the survival, recovery and growth of Irish tourism, which the Government has been progressing.Finally, as Deputies will be aware, the tourism services budget for 2010 represents a 3% increase on the 2009 provision.  In the context of a difficult budgetary situation, this is a clear demonstration of the Government's belief that with the right policies and targeted investment, tourism can play a major role in Ireland's economic recovery.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	540	We discussed this, or certain aspects of it, this morning already.  The point I would make to the Minister is we are spending a great deal of money on tourism, and yet the target for this year was a modest 3% growth given that everybody thought that 2009 was a really catastrophic year but we would see green shoots in 2010.  As the Minister stated, some countries are coming out of recession, they are our target markets and that is where we are spending the money.  Indeed, the value of the euro has been falling vis-à-vis sterling.  One would imagine it was beginning to get better, and yet in the first three months we have seen a drop in visitor numbers of a monumental 23%.  One must think that is due to something other than the weather.  It is easy, and extremely Irish, to blame the weather for the fall in the tourism figures, but it must be something more than that.On Trip Advisor, when it recommended the various countries, certain towns and cities got some recommendation but in the top ten, we were not in the cultural and site-seeing destinations of the world, we were not in the emerging destinations of the world, we were not in the romance destinations of the world, we were not in European destinations chosen by Europeans and we were not in outdoor and adventure destinations of the world.One must begin to wonder if we are doing something terribly wrong when we are spending so much money and getting it so monumentally wrong.  Is the Minister worried about that?I made the point, and my colleague, Deputy Upton, has made it too on many occasions, that we are fighting an uphill battle as an island nation and access is our most crucial issue.  I am not saying access is everything but it is a necessary condition.  It may not be a sufficient condition for tourism but it is a necessary one.  If people cannot get here, we will have no tourist industry whatsoever.I am looking at recommendations such as the survival action plans from the Minister's Tourism Renewal Group, and practically the primary one was get rid of the travel tax.  The others were to look at local authority rates for hotels, and the cost of wages and the JLCs.  All of those issues were mentioned in the survival plan and none of them has been implemented.  I wonder is the Minister now looking more seriously at moving in the direction of taking the advice of her own advisers, the Tourism Renewal Group before we get further into the year.  Alarm bells must to on in her Department when she sees a drop of 23% in the first three months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Unfortunately, I suspect that the figures which will be announced tomorrow for April will also be bad due to the impact of the volcano.  In fairness, this was an incident which genuinely impacted on us because Ireland was the first landmass to be hit by this and it had a very negative impact on our tourist numbers.In fairness to Tourism Ireland, I am genuinely impressed with the way in which it is able to adapt and change and tap in to the new markets.  As I mentioned earlier, I spent Monday of last week in Frankfurt meeting with the trade and media, doing interviews about the importance of the island of Ireland as being great value and easily accessible.  They have a great interaction with Tourism Ireland.We are using all the methods of marketing.  We have joint partnership with the carriers — the airlines and the ferries; television advertising which catches the mass market; and website advertising, for instance, Tourism Ireland has 41 international websites in 19 different languages.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	542	They cannot get here in any language.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	543	They have not been able to get here at times during the year, but at least the strong message is getting out there.Value is one of the issues.  We have started, particularly this year, to offer better value: cheaper fares so access is good; cheaper accommodation; and better value for food, particularly for main meals and dinners, and for family holidays as well.  Then there are new initiatives, which is also part of the Tourism Renewal Group.  I refer to older people, the silver surfers — no single supplement, two for one, etc. — and the golden trekkers, those over 66.  Many of the survival actions in the Tourism Renewal Group report, which we will be discuss again in a few moments, are the ones that are all being acted upon.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I accept what Tourism Ireland is doing and it is doing a good job.  My point is that it is being spancelled by the absence of route access.  As the Minister will be aware, as I think I said it to her in the Chamber, when Tourism Ireland went to conduct its marketing campaign in Germany it discovered that eight of the cities in which it was going to campaign had just lost their Dublin route.Apart from the direct tourism jobs that are dependent on foreigners coming here, there are other big investments dependent on people having access to the country, for instance, Terminal 2 which is due to open early next year I think——
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	545	This year.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	546	——this year, and the conference centre, which is due to open in September.  The Minister has met Ryanair and the other airlines.  Has she also joined forces with the Minister for Transport, for instance, who must be very concerned about T2 opening with the significant drop of 5 million passengers that Dublin Airport has experienced in the past year?The Minister must look for help when she goes to Cabinet if she is to get the tax removed.  It is a disincentive to Ryanair in maintaining routes and it is imperilling the future of Aer Lingus, which is even more important.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The Deputy is correct, in that air access is critical to the country.  Well more than 80% of all tourists to Ireland arrive by air.  It looks like the consolidation by airlines will result in fewer seats being available this summer than was the case last year.  It would appear that summer air access will decline by 6% compared with the same period last year, comprising a 9% drop in tourists from the UK, a 2% drop from mainland Europe and an expected decline of 14% from North America.  Arising out of my meetings with Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Aer Arann, I held an informal discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Transport.  It was only yesterday that I met Mr. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair.  I have tried to draw together the issues the airlines see as significant in the context of their decisions on which routes to use.  The question of the air tax arose in that regard.  On the other hand, strong growth of 87% in visitor numbers from the new and developing markets is expected this year.  Air access is the crucial matter in bringing them all to Ireland.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	548	The renewed programme for Government contains a commitment to undertake a detailed assessment of the GPO complex with a view to locating the Abbey Theatre there in time for the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  The development of a new national theatre project is a complex undertaking and a myriad of technical, procedural and legal factors must be addressed in making progress.  Seeking to deliver a national theatre building at the GPO, with all of the history that embraces the building, adds to the complexity and calls for a particular sensibility.A feasibility group involving the key stakeholders has been set up.  Its membership includes representatives from my Department, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, An Post and the Abbey Theatre.  The group has commenced an assessment of the GPO complex to ascertain if it is a feasible location for the redeveloped national theatre.  Among the main considerations that must be assessed are the GPO's capacity to accommodate the brief agreed for the Abbey Theatre, the integration of theatre infrastructure into the streetscape and skyscape, the feasibility from a planning perspective of any redevelopment proposal, the cost of the construction, the nature of the title to the site, the terms and conditions of leases, indentures, mortgages, liens thereon, and so on, and the costs of lease termination and other commercial and corporate issues for An Post.Significant progress has been made on the technical accommodation questions.  The legal and corporate issues I mentioned must be considered.  I anticipate that it will be the autumn before all of the elements of the feasibility study have been addressed fully.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I feel I have grown old with this project.  I do not know how many times the proposal has crossed the Liffey.  I am dizzy from it.  Some years ago, the late Mr. Seamus Brennan announced with great fanfare a design competition for the Abbey Theatre.  As much as a year later, possibly during the tenure of the subsequent Minister, Mr. Martin Cullen, the design of the design competition was announced.  Subsequently, we heard of judges being appointed.  The next we heard was that the competition was being called off because the project had moved from the docks to the GPO.  While the GPO would be a good location for it, the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, used phrases like "myriad of technical, procedural and legal factors" and "a report will be brought to Government in due course" the last time I heard her discuss the matter.  When I see words like those put together in a sentence, I see a long finger emerging.  I suspect that, in the Minister's heart, she knows the project will not go ahead.  If that is the case, please let it be known.I would love to see a flagship project in 2016, but I must ask myself whether this is the project that Ireland needs most.  The Grand Canal Theatre is open and the conference centre is a fantastic stage and venue.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Does the Deputy have a question?
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I will not pillory the Minister if she decides to pull back, since we could invest our money elsewhere, for example, in capital expenditure on schools or the maintenance of venues built under the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme, ACCESS, many of which are in dire need of even basic maintenance.  Has the Minister really made up her mind and, if so, will she let us know?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	552	No, I have not made up my mind, as I have not seen the feasibility study.  It is not just a case of using phrases like "myriad of technical, procedural and legal factors", since those are actual issues.  For example, the fact that there are tenants in the arcade means a commercial element is involved.  There is probably a view that the GPO should continue to be used as a post office in some form or other.  I agree because it was a general post office in 1916.  Good designs and plans can incorporate all of this.When examining the feasibility of trying to accommodate everything that is required for the Abbey Theatre, namely, a larger theatre, a smaller studio and a new project theatre, one must consider the costs.  I do not accept the argument that work on iconic buildings should be set aside to invest in the maintenance of other buildings or to transfer money to other Departments.  For example, the schools budget this year is approximately €589 million.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Does the Minister have a budget at all?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	554	The capital budget for schools is approximately €589 million.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	555	I meant for the Abbey Theatre.  There is no budget.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	556	That is what I am saying.  It all comes out of the same capital fund.  I do not agree that money that could be earmarked for an iconic cultural building such as the National Concert Hall or the national theatre should be transferred to other Departments for their use.  The Grand Canal Theatre and the convention centre are magnificent, but they are not the national theatre and not every play in the Abbey Theatre would fill the 2,000 seats in either of them.  Taking pride in its culture says something about a country.  Above all others, Ireland should do this.The honest answer is that I have not decided yet.  I have not seen the feasibility study.  The project will be examined in terms of how possible it is and whether it is the best decision for the Abbey Theatre.  Then we will need to fight the financial argument, but something should be done with an iconic building for 2016.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	557	Does the Minister see why I am becoming a little sceptical?  If it is decided that the GPO will not be the venue, where will we go then?  Will we return to the docks or the original site of the Abbey Theatre or will we cross the Liffey a few more times?  This could go on forever and all it would do is cost us money for which we would have nothing to show.  I do not dispute that a flagship Abbey Theatre would be wonderful, but if this is a time wasting exercise, we should just admit it.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	558	There is no doubt that the Abbey Theatre needs more space.  It needs to be more accessible than it is.  This year, it faced difficulties in terms of access for the disabled.  The theatre set out a general accommodation plan on the size it requires and is experiencing considerable success with some of the work produces.  We would like the theatre to accommodate such work and be a flagship project, not just as a building, but as something that can produce Irish theatre.  It has planned an exciting international programme for 2011, particularly in the United States of America.  Since I have not seen the feasibility study, I am not in a position to make a determination on it.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	559	At its 2010 annual policy meeting, the Arts Council devoted most of its time to the planning of its successor strategy.  The strategy will take into account the changed environment since 2005 and the distinctive role the arts can play in contributing to the national recovery.  In the development of its new strategy, the Arts Council will enter into discussions with my Department and me over the coming months.  It should be noted that the Arts Council is a statutorily independent body funded by my Department.  It is independent in its day-to-day operations and funding decisions.Government policy on the arts is set out in the renewed programme for Government and is elaborated on further in my Department's statement of strategy.  My policy is to move the arts centre stage in our economy and to increase access to and participation in the arts.  A country like ours survives and prospers on the talent and ability of its people.  Modern goods and services require high value added input.  Some of this comes from technology and financial capital, but much of it comes from people who have the ability to innovate and a capacity for lateral thinking.Creative human capacity is our primary wealth.  Creativity is enhanced by interaction with arts.  The perception abroad of Ireland as a country that values creativity has undoubtedly assisted in attracting companies such as Google, eBay and Apple, whose cultures place a high value on creativity.  This provides an economic rationale for making the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.The global economic forum at Farmleigh recognised the arts, culture and creative industries as our foremost calling card internationally.  The Arts Council needs to take the momentum from that engagement and reflect it in its strategy.  The new strategy should be built on the achievements of its forerunner, especially in participation, venue animation, engagement with young people, supporting our art forms of real strength — especially literature and drama — national, regional and local festivals and supporting the international marketing and promotional work of Culture Ireland.  The context for the new strategy must take account of the more limited resources available from the Exchequer and it must look to build on synergies with the other agencies under my Department, especially Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	560	Perhaps my question was not well worded.  I was more interested in the funding that flowed from the Arts Council and how that might be prioritised so that its value is maximised.  I spoke to the Minister this morning about the need to refocus on the sad state of contemporary literature.  I refer to the loss of publishing houses and the real danger that there will be no Irish publishing as a result of the reduction in support for writers and library grants, which guaranteed a certain amount of Irish publishing every year.  We cannot live on the past forever.  Seamus Heaney was great but we must consider who will be the next Seamus Heaney.  We must bring along new writers and one cannot be nursed along if there is no opportunity to be published in this country.One hears about the Cork Opera House closing for a couple of months and the Temple Bar gallery and studios closing its exhibition space.  Venues around the country may not be closing but are closed for many days during the week as a result of cutbacks.  Is there any way of tracking job losses and closures as a result of cutbacks?  This is not to apportion blame but to identify what can be done in the new strategy to deal with the fact there is not as much money even though we have all these venues and artists seeking funding.  How can we sustain employment in the lean times and protect investments that have been made in the good years?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	561	The Deputy's question concerns funding and at this stage it is too early to indicate what funding will be available next year.  This year, the allocations is just short of €69 million.  This is a substantial increase on the sum in 2002.  The Department was aiming for €100 million.  At the height, in 2007, it was €83 million but the sum of €69 million is a significant advance on the sum of seven or eight years ago.Like every other area, it had to be cut.  I am not aware of many redundancies.  People generally took pay cuts or had to cut back on activities but, no more than in the tourism sector, the arts community has the ability to draw in volunteers to work and organise.  I visited theatres in Monaghan, Longford and Birr and the people involved have a creative ability to make do.  I am not aware of people who lost their jobs as a result of these cutbacks.Deputy Mitchell's point in respect of literature is very fair.  It is the artform for which we are best known.  Capital funding for the Dublin Writers Museum highlights that point, as does the Dalkey book festival.  It is not true to say they are all people who belong in the past.  Consider the success of Joseph O'Connor with his new book or Colum McCann.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	566	Planning permission has been obtained for phase 1 of the national sports campus.  The planning permission includes provision for a multi-sport national indoor training centre to provide world-class training facilities for more than 20 sports; sports science and medical facilities; accommodation for sportsmen and women; all-weather synthetic pitches for community recreational access; and a national field sports training centre catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey.It was estimated in late 2009 that the cost of this phase of the campus development will be approximately €104 million, excluding VAT and exclusions.  However, because of the difficult budgetary situation facing the Government, it has not been possible to obtain the funding necessary to move forward with phase 1 of the national sports campus project at this time.  In recognition of the current budgetary situation, my Department asked the NSCDA to produce a proposal for a reduced scheme with costings over a three year period.  This proposal has recently been received and is under consideration in the context of the Department's multi-annual capital envelope and the 2011 Estimates process.  Any allocation of funding in 2011 will be made as part of the normal Estimates and budgetary processes undertaken each year.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	567	Is this five-year or ten-year planning permission?  This project has been in the pipeline for a long time and the response of the Minister suggests there is no great confidence in respect of funding being available to make progress.  If planning permission is for five years, is there a risk of running out of time?  The process will then have to start again.The Minister provided the cost and projections for the refurbished, modified version.  Can the Minister provide the cost of the land purchased?  What is the annual maintenance and running cost?  There must be a running cost going nowhere while we are waiting for progress to happen.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	568	The ongoing costs are limited because it is a small body.  The allocation to the National Sports Campus Development Authority for this year is €7.754 million.  This comprises over €4 million in current funding and €3.6 million in capital funding.  Of the current allocation, day-to-day funding requirements amount to €1.6 million, including staff, and the provision of an operational subsidy to the national aquatic centre amounts to up to €1 million.  These are the ongoing costs at the moment.I do not have information on planning permission and I will revert to the Deputy on that point.  All of the sporting bodies I met are enthusiastic about this project, particularly in respect of the need to provide a multisport national indoor training centre.  It is remarkable that people like Derval O'Rourke manage to do so well without an indoor centre.  I asked the authority to come up with a revised plan.  One facility builds on another in an integrated fashion but we will examine the revised plan to see how much, if any, we can progress.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	569	Many of our elite athletes are training outside Ireland.  If we are to continue receiving kudos and being successful in athletics, we must examine the facilities.  We spent some €114,000 on a consultants' report in regard to the Olympics.  That was predicated on these facilities being available so we could get athletes into the country.  There is no chance of that happening at this stage.  Has this not been a terrible waste of an investment of €114,000 on the consultants' report if there is no chance of being able to capitalise on it?To return to the question of the tourist sector, arising from that consultants' report what are the possibilities of getting people to holiday in Ireland based on the facilities here?  They might come to encourage their own team, if we can get them here, but that appears to be lost because of the lack of progress on this issue.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	570	It was a good idea at the time to do the consultants' report on the Olympics, and all is not yet lost because they are lobbying hard for the National Aquatic Centre to be used as a training centre by international teams and athletes in the lead-up to the 2012 Olympics.  There has been an encouraging response because the pool has a reputation as one of Europe's foremost 50m swimming pool facilities.  I mentioned earlier that the American juniors team were here but as well as that the national co-ordinator of the US synchronised swimming team visited it and they have confirmed that the team is definitively interested in training in the centre in the lead-up to the Games.Belfield and UCD launched a bid also, as did the University of Limerick.  I mention Belfield in particular because it would be able to tie in with the pool were it to be successful.  It will probably not get a country doing all of its sports there but perhaps individual sports, particularly from some of the smaller countries.  We may well be successful in that regard.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	572	My question is about travel agents, but I do not mind.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	573	They are also about the effect of inward tourism.Neither I nor the tourism agencies have a role in relation to Irish-based travel agents and tour operators.  Licensing and bonding arrangements for such businesses come under the remit of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, for which my colleague, the Minister for Transport, has overall responsibility.  While it is true that outbound tourism routes may play a role in supporting the viability of certain access routes, in the wider context of overall levels of access to Ireland I am advised that the impact of individual outbound operators is relatively marginal.As I said in my response to the earlier priority question, the tourism figures to date reflect very difficult conditions, including economic uncertainty, bad weather and the Icelandic volcanic ash but similarly, as outlined in the same reply, it is now clear that the targets originally set for the year will be very difficult to meet.  However, it is important to note that over 60% of holidaymakers normally arrive into Ireland between May and September.  I am aware that the industry and the tourism agencies are seeking every available business.Building on the renewal group's framework for action, budget 2010 recognised the tourism sector as a critical sector and provided for a 3% increase to over €153 million in the overall tourism services budget for 2010.  This included maintaining the real level of investment in overseas marketing, as well as a significantly increased capital allocation for tourism product.  Tourism was also included in cross-cutting measures to support enterprises and jobs, including the employment subsidy scheme and the credit review scheme.  Additional specific measures, such as changes in VAT and the Golden Trekker rail travel initiative, are also helping the sector.In line with the renewal group's framework for action, the Government, my Department and the tourism agencies are working extremely hard to assist the sector, to maximise business for Irish tourism and to ensure that the tourism agenda is in all relevant policies.  Apart from the survival action relating to air travel tax, we have either implemented or are making good progress on the other four survival actions recommended by the renewal group.Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have built in renewal group recommendations to their business and marketing plans for 2010 and my officials are working with a range of other organisations to focus resources, achieve common objectives and maximise the impact on tourism.Fáilte Ireland is working closely with businesses all over Ireland to increase their customer base, better manage costs, improve overall performance and sustain employment.  In 2010, Fáilte Ireland is investing over €11 million in direct supports and advice for tourism enterprises.In my response to an earlier priority question, I outlined details of overseas marketing activity and Tourism Ireland's priorities in that regard.On the domestic front, Fáilte Ireland launched a €4 million promotional campaign to encourage holidaying at home this year.  Investment in business, sporting and cultural events is also being increased.  Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are boosting promotion of business tourism in the build up to the official opening, in September, of the convention centre in Dublin.  That facility, along with the new Aviva stadium, the O2 and the Grand Canal Theatre venues and Thomond Park, will further enhance Ireland's capacity to attract international events.As regards engagement with tourism industry stakeholders, I am always interested in hearing their views and opinions and have responded in my contacts to any submissions received.  Since my appointment, I have met the chairs and chief executives of the tourism agencies — Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Shannon Development — as well as the main representative bodies in the tourism sector and the main airlines serving the island of Ireland.  I have also had an opportunity to canvass the views of many other stakeholders at the many functions and events I have attended around the country.  On Tuesday, I addressed the Tourism Ireland Innovation Summit, which took place in Farmleigh House.Our response to the disruption to air travel following the volcanic eruptions in Iceland demonstrated the advantages of this ongoing relationship with tourism stakeholders.  I convened a meeting in May with representatives of the tourism industry and the tourism agencies.  Subsequently, all parties worked together, supported by Fáilte Ireland, to develop and agree a customer care charter to help reassure and improve confidence for both tourism enterprises and potential tourists.Overall, I believe the Government is pursuing the right programmes and measures to support the continued development of tourism.  We are working with the industry and the tourism agencies to position the tourism sector for recovery and growth as part of the Government's wider strategy for economic renewal.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	574	I thank the Minister.  I raise the issue of the Irish travel agents, and I am pleased the Minister accepted the question because it impacts on Irish tourism, although I am asked the reason I am interested in people going out of Ireland.  There are a number of reasons, and the main one is the fact that Irish jobs are being lost when travel agents close.  Two years ago there were approximately 420 travel agents but that figure is now down to 200.  I understand 50 closed in recent months.  That is a lot of jobs lost in an industry.I made the point that aeroplanes leaving this country can come back full.  The Minister said it is a marginal contribution towards inward tourism but the reality is that all the aeroplanes leaving here are going to destinations that are on scheduled routes.  My point is that we would be tapping into a whole new market, and it is essential that we do not ignore that.I was speaking to one travel agent recently who told me about the Spanish scheme for the over 55s about which we spoke about here on a number of occasions.  It is a subsidised scheme.  I understand one can travel to Malaga and some of the Spanish islands.  It is a Government subsidised scheme.  The local government contributes, say, €50 and the central government contributes another €50, and one gets the flight to Spain from Ireland or from any country, full board for a fortnight and two trips in the local area for €355, €395 or some ludicrously cheap price.  Those aeroplanes are leaving here full of passengers, and the only requirement is that one must be over 55.  The Minister can look forward to that.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	575	Not for a while yet.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	576	No, but she can look forward to it.Irish people are lapping up those holidays.  The aeroplanes are leaving here and they could be returning here full if we were to offer something similar.  That would not be throwing good money after bad.  It is not like a tax incentive.  The money has to be spent by people.  They would have to come here before they got the subsidy.  That is an area we could examine.  The Spanish Government is in a similar position to ours in that it invested heavily in tourism and it now finds the tourists are not as plentiful as they were in the past, but they have responded this way.After much lobbying the Minister introduced the travel scheme for foreign visitors over the age of 66 but it is restricted to trains.  The network of trains is very limited.  Even if we began by extending that to the buses, it would make the scheme much more attractive.  Despite the Minister's wishes in that regard, I cannot see the Queen taking the train to Sligo, but one never knows.  She might take a bus if the buses were also available as part of the same scheme.  We must examine innovative ideas like that and I ask the Minister to do that.  I will come back in later to speak on another aspect of this question.  As was said earlier, Her Majesty would qualify as a golden trekker.  That anyone over 66 years of age visiting Ireland can avail of free rail travel is a wonderful and imaginative scheme.  I would, however, prefer if people did not have to book it 48 hours in advance.  While Northern Ireland does not have the same extensive rail network that we have, there are discussions about extending the scheme to there.Already up to 4,500 visitors have availed of the golden trekker scheme.  It is one for families to know about when they are inviting relatives from abroad.  One can travel on Irish Rail services, the DART and the Luas.  If her majesty does decide to come to Dún Laoghaire, we will get her into town on the DART and down to Killarney on the train.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	577	She can get the Luas to Dundrum.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The main job of travel agents was to get people out of the country.  Many people go on sun holidays to the south of Spain and the Canaries, areas with low populations.  On the other end, we have the Irish tour operators bringing people into the country.  However, with more Internet booking, people tend to choose their own activities.Deputy Mitchell referred to the tour advice lists which Ireland is not on.  However, the Lonely Planet guides list Ireland as one of the top ten friendliest countries in the world and Cork as one of the top ten cities in the world to visit.  Those are more significant lists to be on than some of the others.  Also Dublin is listed in the top ten for best night-life and Dingle as one of the most charming towns to visit.  We do make the lists.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	579	Yes, but not the country as a whole.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	580	German tourists are still very dependent on travel agents and tour operators.  The Germans take more and longer holidays — and I suspect spend more on them — than anyone else.  That is why Germany has become a significant market for Irish tourism.  It is now our third largest market.  Reaching out to them is still largely done through tour operators.  While the loss of the travel agency business in Ireland may have affected outgoing tourists, it has not had such an impact on incoming tourists.The Deputy is correct on the significance of new destinations.  That is a matter that can be addressed in partnership with the air carriers.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I agree the golden trekker scheme is excellent.  Many people have been in touch with me about accessing it.  While they do not have problems with the 48-hour notice, it would be more convenient if it could be instantaneous.  It would also be convenient if it could be extended to the bus network.  I spoke to a group from Clare who were under the impression it had already been extended to the bus network.  It must be remembered such an extension would be very important for rural areas, many of which do not have rail connections.Some other visitors were a little miffed that their husbands or wives who may be under 66 years had to pay.  I appreciate the difficulties surrounding extending it in this regard but it might be considered in the future.  It would be welcome also if it were extended to Northern Ireland.  Some ask why it cannot be extended Europe-wide.  It might be beneficial to examine what mutual arrangements can be arrived at in this regard.The Asian market will become increasingly important to our tourism sector.  We need to examine providing language facilities for tourists from this market.  There is also a serious problem around visitors from this market getting visas to visit Ireland.  I accept it falls under the remit of the Department of Justice and Law Reform but I believe the Minister must get it to address the matter sooner rather than later.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	582	The visa issue for the new emerging markets is crucial as we need to be able to welcome them and Ireland has been designated as a preferred country of destination for holidaymakers.  Some progress has been made on speeding up the provision of visas to those coming on group tours.  I have been in contact with the Minister for Justice and Law Reform on this matter and will be discussing it next week.  I will impress upon him the importance of dealing with it.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Travel agents are a dying breed yet they have a useful role in the tourism sector such as providing employment and inward tourism opportunities.  What is really killing them off is the bonding arrangement set in place 40 years ago.  I do not know how the figure for 4% of total turnover for the bond was reached.  It can be a sizeable amount of cashflow which the travel agent must keep aside at all times.  The figure also assumes and provides sufficient insurance cover to allow for all travel agents failing together. Such an event will never happen.Things have also moved on since the bond was first introduced.  With Internet bookings many people do not take out insurance on short trips or use their health insurance.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation examined the bond system and described it as being out of date but made no recommendations for improvement.  The Minister for Transport decided to wait for an EU response on this.  However, the EU process can be very slow and, meanwhile, all the travel agents are closing down.The bond arrangement is needless and onerous.  I am all in favour of protecting the consumer but this is overprotection.  A common fund should be established to which all travel agents could contribute which would afford travellers sufficient cover.  This is what happens in all other industries, including banks.  Will the Minister discuss this with the Minister for Transport?  With so few travel agents in business, we will rue the day when the entire industry is gone.  As an island country, we still need that type of service.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	584	Road signage is a nightmare for many of our visitors, as well as ourselves.  There is so much that could be done to improve it not just in Dublin city but across the country.  An audit should be carried out to establish what kind of good signs are needed across the country.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	585	Let us find out what is right and wrong.  There are signs in km/h in some places and further up the same road other signs are in mph.  They are all different sizes, shapes and makes.  This is especially the case on roundabouts in the country.  I have been known to drive around twice just to ensure I come off at the right place.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	586	Only twice?
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I have no wish to admit to my driving ability and my sense of direction.The other issue is integrated ticketing.  I appreciate it is a matter for another ministry but it is very important.  Visitors are gobsmacked when they come here from other major European cities and realise they need four different tickets to travel by rail and bus and so on.  These two issues are not very complicated.  We have talked endlessly about integrated ticketing and it has not taken place or if it has, only in a minor or limited way.  It is urgent that this should be put in place as quickly as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	588	These two issues are more related to transport.  One of the measures for funding put in place this year in my previous Department, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, was to include a photograph on the PPS card.  This will assist with integrated ticketing and it will be the first project to benefit from that measure.I refer to the tour operators.  At the time of the volcanic ash when there were delays, those who had booked through a travel agent were covered and protected by insurance, whereas those who had booked independently found it more difficult.  Research in Fáilte Ireland has shown there are two things people like when they come to the country.  First, to have access to a personal agent, information or someone who will help them and second, the availability of good maps.  This relates to the Deputy's point about signage, especially in the case of the new roadways.  There is concern among some of the major tourism attractions that the signs used to direct traffic off main roads are not in place on the newer motorways.  Many parties are lobbying now to ensure their tourism destination is signposted.  This may involve attractive commercial ventures which seek to be recognised by road signs.  I accept these matters must be dealt with.  Deputy Mitchell referred to the issue of bonding.  This is something I must refer to my colleague, the Minister for Transport.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	589	My final point relates to broadband.  I realise I have raised this matter several times but unless we have better broadband we are discriminating against people, especially in rural areas.  I refer in particular to bed and breakfast people to whom we referred last night and the previous night during Private Members' debate.  These people are seriously disadvantaged for many other reasons already but if they do not have access to decent broadband they will be seriously out of the loop with regard to competing.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	590	I refer to the extension of broadband as part of the broadband strategy.  It is important that people have access to Wi-Fi in modern Ireland.  However, people do not come to a country for Wi-Fi.  I refer to the marketing in such sectors as food tourism, which has a strategy to attract people, and the new golf tourism brand.  We should be able to market Ireland given the successes of both Graeme McDowell and Padraig Harrington.  The Irish Open is due to take place in Killarney and both men will play, hopefully, with the same amount of sunshine as at present.  This should be seen as a marketing opportunity for the whole world and it will attract a vast number of people.  I refer to business tourism as well.  In fairness, we are working on all the points raised by the tourism renewal group.The issue of air tax is one that must be examined in the context of the budget and putting together the argument in this regard.  Other issues such as broadband which the group mentioned are being pursued as well.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Pat Rabbitte — the response to the report of the Migrants' Rights Centre, Hidden Messages — Overt Agenda; (2) Deputy Chris Andrews — the need to consult with the patients and families during the closure process of St. Patrick Dunne's Hospital, Dublin; (3) Deputy James Bannon — the need to provide a new community college for Kilbeggan, County Westmeath; (4) Deputy Joe Costello — the need to explain the reason that a number of applications for renewal of medical cards are being refused under the new system; and (5) Deputy David Stanton — the need to provide funding to allow an extension to be constructed and improvements to be carried out at Kilcredan National School, Kilcredan, Ladysbridge, County Cork.The matters raised by Deputies David Stanton, Pat Rabbitte, James Bannon and Chris Andrews have been selected for discussion.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter this evening.  I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White, is present to answer in the debate and I trust she will have some good news for us.  Kilcredan national school was built in the 1970s.  It was an amalgamation of three small primary schools.  The policy at the time was to amalgamate small primary schools.  It is a fantastic school.  Some ten years ago in 2000, it was agreed with the Department of Education and Science that there was a need for an extension because very little work had been done in the 30 years since the school was put together.  A design team was appointed and a plan submitted.  The plans were examined in 2005, some five years later and the matter has been ongoing for some time.  In the meantime, the people in the area raised €220,000 to buy land and provide a car park for the extension.  The people have not been found wanting and they are not coming with their hands out.  They have been working very hard to raise funds for this project.They seek permission to move to the next stage, that is, to allow for planning permission, tenders and construction.  This is what they seek from the Minister and the Department.  There will be 256 students in the school next September.  I realise the Minister of State is from a rural area.  This school was built in the centre of a parish.  Three primary schools were amalgamated from two villages, Ballymacoda and Ladysbridge.  There was no agreement on where the school should go so they put it in the centre but that solution worked.  It is an outstanding rural school.The demographics for the coming five years inform us there will be further increases in enrolment.  At present, half the school is in prefabs.  The plan is to build an all-purpose hall, a library, a staff room and 12 classrooms in total.  It is not a great deal to ask for.  This has been ongoing for ten years and the people in the area have worked remarkably hard.  They have gone over and above the call of duty in this case in raising funds and in meeting the Department more than half way on the cost of this project.  I hope the Minister of State can come up with something positive this evening or, if not, that she can go back to the Department and impress on the staff there the importance, urgency and the need to match the goodwill of the people in this case.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response with interest.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	593	I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the current position with regard to Kilcredan national school, Kilcredan, Ladysbridge, County Cork.Modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The allocation of funding for school buildings in 2010 is just less than €579 million.  This represents a significant investment in the schools building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the Government's commitment to investing in school infrastructure and it will permit the continuation of the Department's programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools, a commitment under the revised programme for Government.All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc. leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to each project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exist but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band 4 project makes provision for desirable, but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or a new sports hall.  The proposed building project for Kilcredan national school is currently at an early stage of architectural planning.  The project for the national school has been assigned a band rating of 2.4 under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.All major projects on the Department's capital programme progress through the same structured process of architectural planning, which is divided into clearly defined stages.  The stages of architectural planning are set out in the Department's design team procedures and are necessary to comply with Department of Finance guidelines, which require that capital projects be fully designed prior to going to tender.  They also ensure proper cost management of capital projects and facilitate compliance with statutory and public procurement requirements.There are five stages involved in the progression of major school projects through architectural planning.  The project for Kilcredan national school is currently moving towards completion of stage 2a which involves the detailed design of the new accommodation to be provided and any refurbishment work to be undertaken.  The brief for the project includes the construction of a four classroom extension increasing the school to a 12 classroom school.Following discussions with the Department's technical staff in May of this year, the school's design team was requested to provide an addendum to its earlier stage 2a submission.  This addendum was recently received in the Department.  The submission with the addendum information is currently being reviewed and the Department will revert directly to the school when that review is complete.The next step for this project, once stage 2a is approved, will be to seek planning permission, a fire certificate and a disability access certificate and prepare tender documents as part of stage 2b of architectural planning.  Once these necessary statutory approvals have been secured, the project can be considered for progression to tender which forms stage 3 of the architectural planning process.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2011 and subsequent years.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department and taking into account the necessary statutory approvals which I have outlined that still need to be secured, it is not possible at this time to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project to tender and construction.On behalf of the Tánaiste, I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the school building project for Kilcredan national school.  As a rural Deputy, I appreciate the efforts the local community has made in regard to this project.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and I wish the new Minister of State with responsibility for integration well since I have not had the opportunity to do so since she was appointed.  I look forward to hearing her response to the important pamphlet, Hidden Message — Overt Agendas, prepared for the Migrant Rights Centre.It is especially timely given the dramatic reversal in the country's economic fortunes.  The spectrum of welcome that existed for migrants at the height of the boom becomes somewhat narrowed in a time of recession.  This imposes higher demands on political leadership.  The breadth of welcome for migrant workers at the height of the boom was somewhat surprising until one understood that certain sections of Irish society, not well known for their liberal disposition, were motivated by considerations of cheap labour.  The availability of a pool of cheap labour — young, educated, disciplined, willing, non-trade union organised workers — left some employers with stars in their eyes.Some of these same employers have exploited the indefensible arrangement whereby the current employment permits system binds the migrant worker to a particular employer.  Currently, the system requires that a worker must stay a minimum of 12 months with an employer, pay another permit fee of €1,000 and wait several months, during which time they are not allowed to work, before an application to change employer can be processed.  I submit that bonded labour in 2010 is a scandal.  One of its many consequences is to undermine good employers as others take advantage of bonded workers.  The spectacle of hundreds of migrant workers queuing for days for re-entry visas cannot be defended.  What would be our response if Irish workers were treated in this fashion in London or Los Angeles?This report traces the positive statements of several Ministers and then compares it to the practice, hence the title, Hidden Messages — Overt Agendas.  The report shows that many of the fine sentiments written for Ministers are mitigated by actions taken at the direction of the same Ministers.One of the success stories of our experience of significant inward migration for the first time in our history is the performance of our schools.  Our teachers have done an excellent job, sometimes in almost impossible circumstances.  Our problems as a society really only begin outside the school gate.  If we persist in cutting the number of English language support teachers in primary schools, we are inviting additional difficulties.We now have an employment crisis.  People contacted me as recently as Saturday last claiming that they and their colleagues had been made redundant and replaced by migrant workers prepared to work for less than the going rate.  The only solution to this problem is better invigilation of standards in the workplace which makes it regrettable that the Government has only partially delivered on its promises on labour inspectors, something for which I have consistently campaigned.This is a comprehensive and seamless document, to which I cannot do justice in the time allowed in an Adjournment Debate.  However, we must debate it because of the importance for our society of the issues raised.  I conclude by endorsing the warning in the report that "Migration is not a phenomenon that can be switched on and off to suit the needs of the host economy."  As a society, we must come to grips with the implications of that warning.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	595	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to comment on it.  As the Deputy indicates, this document was published by the Migrant Rights Centre.  Since taking office as Minister of State with special responsibility for equality, integration and human rights, I have made it my business to meet as many people and organisations involved in the integration field in different parts of the country as I possibly can.  From them I am learning of the challenges that face us as a country in integrating newcomers and the way we are responding to those challenges.  Among the bodies I have met has been the Migrant Rights Centre and I greatly admire the work of the centre in helping migrants.As is indicated in the matter tabled by the Deputy, the Migrant Rights Centre published this document but it should be acknowledged that it was written by Mr. Niall Crowley, a person who is a respected advocate for equality and for the marginalised over many years as chief executive of the Equality Authority and in the NGO sector.In March this year, the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, as Minister of State with responsibility for integration, issued the following statements in response to the Migrant Rights Centre pamphlet.  In the context of this office, no reference is made to the grants given to national groups in various fields to support integration in sporting and cultural fields as well as grants made available to local authorities to support integration in their own areas.The pamphlet quotes correctly the McCarthy report as recommending that the Office of the Minister for Integration should be abolished and that language support teachers in schools should be reduced from 2,200 to 500.  The Government did not abolish this office and the reduction in language support teachers was to approximately 1,500 at a cost, incidentally, of about €100 million.  The pamphlet does not record this fact.In dealing with the live register the author claims that, in previous recessions, the numbers on the register were in some way hostile to women and older people and, as a consequence, apparently massaged to show a lower total.  While it is not germane to the current pamphlet, it is difficult to see how paying pensions instead of unemployment benefits would have been of financial benefit to the governments of those years.  In this recession the author claims that the Government is encouraging migrants to return home as a means of reducing the numbers on the live register.In dealing with racism, the author states that in 2007, there were 224 racist crimes reported in Ireland, an increase of 29.5% on the previous year.  The figures for 2006 were 173; for 2007, 214; for 2008, 172; and for 2009, 126.  Use of incomplete figures can be misleading.  There is no place for racism but a full picture, good or bad, should be given.The author makes much of the fact that there were only 77 labour inspectors in August 2009 — the Government had set a target of 90 two years earlier.  The reality of the effect of the recession on public sector recruitment might have been worthy of mention, alongside the fact that at the time the commitment was made there were 31 such inspectors.  In a similar vein, Mr. Crowley refers to other bodies, in respect of which funding was reduced or eliminated.Since my appointment, I have initiated a process of reviewing the workings of the Equality Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  It is an opportune time to do this and ascertain how their work and the equality framework can be linked with the formulation of social inclusion policy.  The first step in the review process is producing scoping papers on important universal issues concerning equality and rights bodies.  The conclusions on these issues will help to shape the parameters of my review.The press statement issued by the MRC to accompany the pamphlet described it as "a political pamphlet".  My office, as the responsible authority for the European Integration Fund, could not be associated with any publication criticising Ministers and their policies, still less with criticism which amounted to accusations of bad faith, nor could it support attacks on other politicians.  For that reason, funding of more than €5,000 — half the cost of the report — was decommitted from the amount due to the centre for its overall project.I have set up the ministerial council to hear the voices of migrants and make sure they are fully included and integrated in Ireland.  I will set up four regional fora to hear their voices, as they are often on the margins and not heard.  However, they will have my ear.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to discuss this important issue, namely, the need for the Minister for Education and Skills to provide a new community college in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath, or to facilitate the operation of a public private partnership for the project.  While I fully welcome the recent opening of the autism unit at the Mercy Convent in Kilbeggan following protracted representations, I recognise the need for a new purpose built school, which was also highlighted by the school's principal and board of management when the Minister visited the school on the day of the official opening.  The proposed new Kilbeggan community college is to be built on a 13.5 acre site across from the existing secondary school.  The new school is urgently needed owing to overcrowding caused by increased demand for enrolment.An application for the new school, including a special unit for pupils with autism, was lodged with Westmeath County Council last March.  The project, despite its urgency, has been turned down by the Department owing to budgetary constraints.  It was also contended that it had not yet been determined what the future needs of the school were.  There is absolutely no doubt about such needs on the part of the school and the community in Kilbeggan.  The submission to Westmeath County Council included not only an autism unit but a para-education room and a multi-sensory room.  The envisaged school would comprise one and two storey elements.  The school is also planning for five ball courts, a GAA pitch with three dugouts and a roofed viewing area, an exercise warm-up area and track and field facilities.The school is suffering from severe overcrowding, as the Minister acknowledged when she visited less than one month ago.  There is an increased need to provide a new education facility within the town and a 13.5 acre site is available.  While the Department has stated it does not have the money for the project, despite the current underspend in the education budget, there is a viable alternative to complete the building of this much needed school which I would like the Minister of State to take on board.I am particularly concerned that Sheridan Construction, Mullingar, County Westmeath, is in a position to fund the project and lease the school back to the Department of Education and Skills for 30 years, but it has been told it will have to pay a whopping €30,000 in planning fees.  The company which is offering a viable proposal to provide a new school to Kilbeggan is faced with a scenario where its application will not be validated unless it pays these fees.  This is outrageous and I would like the Minister of State to look into the matter.  It was the company's understanding school projects would be exempt from planning fees.  Part 12(157)(1) of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 should provide the necessary exemption.  This refusal of an exemption is tantamount to bringing an end to the progression of this valuable educational initiative.  Will the Minister consider waiving these excessive fees in the interests of facilitating the construction of this much needed school for the Kilbeggan area?
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	600	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the plans of the Department of Education and Skills for post-primary provision in the Kilbeggan catchment area.  The area is served by one post-primary school, Meánscoil an Chlochair.  This is a co-educational, voluntary secondary Mercy Order facility and has a current enrolment of 381 pupils.  The school shares its campus with a primary school.The school authority has applied to the Department for large-scale capital funding to provide a new building on a greenfield site.  Based on a review by the Department's forward planning section, some 550 pupil places will be needed in the area for the long term.  In addition, the Commission on School Accommodation published an area development plan for the N4-M4 area and in its report recommended that Meánscoil an Chlochair be relocated to a greenfield site to enable the increase in enrolments from new housing developments in the area to be adequately catered for.  Given the projected level of increased demand and the restricted nature of the school's existing site, the Department has decided to proceed with the greenfield site option.What is intended is the relocation of the existing voluntary secondary school which is under CEIST trusteeship.  CEIST is the trustee body for a number of religious orders, including the Mercy Order within whose remit Meánscoil an Chlochair comes.  The Department has no plans to establish a further post-primary school in the area, as this is not warranted, or to effect a change of trusteeship or the management model for the existing school.  The first issue that must be addressed to facilitate the relocation of the school is the identification and acquisition of a suitable cost effective site.  In this regard, CEIST has indicated that it may have a site which can be made available for a new school development.  This matter is under discussion with that body.  If it decides to retain ownership of the site, the school building project will be delivered by way of the traditional public procurement method.  If, on the other hand, the site is transferred to the Department's ownership, consideration can be given to delivering the project using the public private partnership model.In May 2009 an alternative proposal was brought forward by a delegation from the school and local developers.  This proposal involves the private development of an alternative site to provide a new post-primary school building which would then be made available to the Department on a lease-purchase arrangement.  The Department is aware that the developers associated with the site lodged a planning application with Westmeath County Council in March for a school on this site.  It was not consulted on the design of the building which normally requires the input of a senior educationist and the Department's professional and technical staff to ensure the curriculum can be fully delivered and that the spaces work from an educational and management perspective.  It was also not notified of the planning application.The public procurement and legal issues surrounding this proposal are complex and they preclude the Department from approving it at this time.The Department still plans to progress a project for the school in accordance with its discussions with the school's owners, and taking account of their preference — which, as the Department understands it, is the development of their own greenfield site.As to when the project can proceed, this is dependent in the first instance on finalisation of the site issue.  Thereafter, the progression of an actual building project will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.  However, due to the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.In the meantime, the Department has provided the school with funding to improve conditions and to provide extra accommodation.  Under the summer works scheme for 2009, funding was made available to upgrade some of the electrics, while under the scheme for 2010, funding is being made available to carry out partial roof repairs.  Also in 2009, an emergency works grant was provided for roof repairs to the gym.  Between 2008 and 2009, significant funding was provided for four extra classrooms and an autistic unit.On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Deputy again for raising this matter.  I hope this clarifies the Department's plans to meet the long-term post primary needs of the Kilbeggan catchment area.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It is important to acknowledge the contribution made by Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital to community health facilities in the south east of Dublin, particularly in Dublin 2, where people from the local community were able to visit their relatives who were unwell.  Any family members I have talked to have spoken very highly of the community care at Sir Patrick Dun's.  They use words such as "caring", "pleasant" and "helpful".  At a time when we are all giving out about the health services, it is important to acknowledge that much good work is being carried out.  The staff in Sir Patrick Dun's are of the highest quality.The building is an old one and it was inevitable that at some point it would no longer be feasible to keep people in that setting.  A new structure was built in Vergemount, which is very welcome.  A building has only a certain lifespan, and with people expecting — rightly — higher standards of safety, the old building just did not measure up any more.  Thus, the decision was made to transfer the patients to Vergemount between now and November.My concern is that we must ensure the transfer of patients is done with much consultation with their families, who are anxious about the move.  Their first choice would have been for their relatives to stay in Sir Patrick Dun's; however, they realise it is a better option to move to Vergemount.  It is important that the families are supported during the transfer process.  For example, one 83-year-old lady is visited by her 87-year-old sister every day, but this may not be possible after the transfer.  It makes things much more difficult.  There should be some sort of mechanism under which visits are facilitated and the visiting families are supported.What is the future of Sir Patrick Dun's hospital?  People are concerned about what will happen.  Ideally, it would become a health care facility of some sort, such as a counselling centre.  It is a great asset and I would hate to lose it to the private sector.  It is important that it is kept within the health service as a provider of health care in the community.  On a related note, I welcome the commitment of the Minister for Health and Children not to sell St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar, because that too is a wonderful facility.  It is important that we keep such facilities in the health infrastructure for the community.I ask the Minister to ensure there is consultation with the families on an ongoing basis and, if there is an option to keep a patient close to the Dublin 2 area, that this be facilitated.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people in living with dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and to support access to quality long-term residential care where appropriate.  It should be noted in the context of the issue raised by the Deputy that the HSE has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including details regarding transfer arrangements and consultation at facilities such as Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital.Services for older people provided at the hospital in recent times include long-stay, respite and day care.  There are currently 16 long-stay residents at Sir Patrick Dun's and eight beds that are used for respite or short-stay patients.  In addition, between 13 and 17 clients attend day care on any given day.The Deputy will appreciate that all developments regarding older people, including long-stay residential and day care services at individual centres such as Sir Patrick Dun's, must be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures.  The HSE has been asked to make a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be reconfigured or reallocated to ensure maximum service provision is achieved.  This requires stringent ongoing review of the application of the resources currently available.  The HSE recognises the challenges ahead in meeting the increased volume and complexity of needs for our ageing population, while also attempting to address the demand for integrated, co-ordinated and appropriate services within the overall health and personal social services system.The executive considers that the long-stay unit in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital will not meet the current HIQA standards.  There are also health and safety issues at the hospital.  In addition, the building is the subject of a preservation order, and it would be very costly to carry out the structural works to meet the standards now in force.  The problems experienced in Sir Patrick Dun's are being addressed by the HSE in the context of the new 100-bed unit that has recently been built on the Clonskeagh campus.  This modern facility is currently being fitted out for equipment.  The overall capital cost of this development is in the region of €16 million.  The vast majority of rooms at the new unit will be single en-suite.  Other facilities include fully equipped occupational therapy and physiotherapy rooms with a large day area.  In addition it will be surrounded by landscaped gardens with access for residents and their families.The HSE intends to move both the residential and day care services from Sir Patrick Dun's to the new unit in Clonskeagh where it will be able to provide services that will meet the standards, as laid down by HIQA and health and safety.  The relocation will provide a higher quality of service to the residents.  The present position is that the executive has applied for registration of the new unit, as required under the new registration and inspection regime of all nursing homes which commenced last year.  It is currently waiting for HIQA to inspect the unit.The HSE is strongly committed to a meaningful consultation process between Sir Patrick Dun's and the residents and their families.  The executive held an information meeting on Thursday, 17 June, with staff, residents and relatives.  It informed the meeting that it proposed to accommodate all the residents together, on one floor, with the staff from Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital at Clonskeagh.  At the meeting it was agreed that residents, together with family members, could volunteer to participate as part of working groups to identify general ongoing issues pertinent to all.  It was also recommended that any individual issue be brought to the attention of the director of nursing and the hospital manager, so that these also could be specifically followed up.  It is envisaged that these groups will be meeting on a regular basis to give information pertinent to the move.  As yet, there is no date for the closure of the long-stay unit.  However, the executive has indicated that this may take place in October 2010, subject to ongoing review.  This will depend to a large extent on inspection and approval from HIQA for the new Clonskeagh unit.  I wish to reassure the House that all the residents and their families, in consultation with the HSE, will be relocated to a better and safer facility which is purpose-built to cater for their future health and well-being.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	603	Tackling the over-capacity that undoubtedly exists in the hotel sector at present is complex and, ideally, requires a market led response over time. As I have said in reply to earlier Questions, 2010 is likely to be another tough year in the hotel sector, with further adjustments taking place as the market responds to excess room supply.  The current position is that NAMA completed the transfer of its first tranche of loans of about €15 billion from the banks at the end of May.  According to NAMA, the transfer of the second tranche of loans is set to commence shortly.    Their aim is to transfer the remaining loans from the five institutions by the end of the year and no later than end February 2011.The transfers completed so far included approximately €300 million worth of hotel backed loans.  The process at this stage will be that the borrowers will provide NAMA with a business plan.  This will cover all property and other loans including those to the hotel sector where appropriate.  These plans will then fall to be evaluated and, if appropriate, reviewed by an independent reviewer, and negotiations with the debtors will then follow.  This will allow for a proper assessment of the likely future performance of these loans.  NAMA say it will take some time, including the transfer of the remaining loans before a clearer picture emerges relating to NAMA's exposure to the hotel sector.I will be encouraging NAMA, through my colleague the Minister for Finance, to take a strategic approach to the hotel sector, to build up their own expertise in this area and to consult with sectoral interests, including the Irish Hotels Federation whom I have already met on this subject. I have not had any direct interaction with NAMA to date, but would intend to meet them in the future on behalf of the hotel sector.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body responsible for the promotion, development and coordination of sport.  The ISC was established on a statutory basis on 1st July 1999, and the functions of the Council are outlined in Section 6 of the Irish Sports Council Act 1999.  A network of 32 Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) have been set up throughout the country by the ISC to coordinate and promote sport at local level especially amongst specific target groups such as older people, girls and women, people with disabilities, unemployed people, and those who live in identified disadvantaged communities.There are currently seventeen Sports Inclusion Development Officers (SIDOs) employed within the LSPs to engage with people with a disability and bring them into the community of sport.   The ISC's decision to allocate continued funding for this programme in 2010 was based on the vital work that is being carried out by SIDOs throughout the country.  Through the SIDO programme a wide range of sports clubs, leisure, education and community centres have developed inclusive policies and implemented guidelines with regard to inclusion and access for people with disabilities.  Disability awareness programmes have been rolled out in co-operation with education providers.  Increased awareness levels have translated into more inclusive promotion of sporting activities and the active participation of people with a disability in mainstream programmes.LSPs delivered over 100 Disability Awareness and Inclusive Games Training courses in 2009.  Over 2,500 participants took part making these courses the most popular training courses run by LSPs last year.  A range of innovative approaches have been employed by the LSPs to increase the participation levels of people with a disability.  Examples include tandem cycling, hill-walking, swimming and horse-riding.  New targeted projects and access initiatives were established in 2009 and these will continue in 2010.  I believe that the SIDOs sanctioned by the ISC to continue working in 2010 will assist in making a practical difference to the lives of very many people who have found barriers to their engagement in sport.

The new Irish company will receive part of its income from the State as grant aid and it will be expected to generate the balance of its operating costs.  Grant-aid to two existing companies — Opera Ireland and Opera Theatre Company — will cease once the new company is up and running as their activities will be subsumed by it.  These companies, between them, cover much of the range of artistic work that would be expected from a national opera company.  At present, Opera Ireland produces main-scale opera in Dublin, while Opera Theatre Company produces smaller-scale opera, both in Dublin and throughout the State, as well as operating outreach and education programmes.An Interim Board, chaired by Mr Ray Bates, former Director of the National Lottery was appointed.  The Chairs of the two existing companies, Ms Virginia Kerr of Opera Theatre Company, and Mr Thomas Lynch of Opera Ireland, are members of the Interim Board as is Sir Brian McMaster, Chairman of the National Opera Studio in the UK and former Managing Director at the Welsh National Opera. To assist in transitional arrangements, the Chief Executives of Opera Ireland and Opera Theatre Company, Mr Niall Doyle and Ms Kirsty Harris, respectively, served on the Interim Board for a period of three months and this period is now complete.I met the Chairman (twice) and the Interim Board in recent weeks.  I understand that considerable progress has been made on company formation, start-up logistics, programming planning, and so forth.  In addition, two opera specialists of international repute have been engaged to advise the Department, the Arts Council, and the Interim Board and to guide formation and other activities.  Opera Ireland and Opera Theatre Company are continuing their work throughout 2010, as agreed with the Arts Council to deliver their agreed respective artistic outputs for all of 2010.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	606	Foreign visitors to Ireland from many of the countries identified as "New and Developing Markets" require visas to enter Ireland.  Tourism Ireland's review of New and Developing Markets — including India, China and 17 other markets — in late 2007, found that visitors from these markets stay twice as long as the average holidaymaker, have the highest spend per visit and have a higher propensity to travel throughout the island of Ireland.  The review also highlighted the potential for increased tourism from Asia and the Middle East and set significant targets — to attract a total of 475,000 visitors from New and Developing Markets by 2013.  While these targets were set in a very different global economic context, they highlight the long-term potential of these markets.To exploit fully the opportunities presented, Ireland needs to be competitive on all fronts.  Clearly, the ability of potential visitors to secure the necessary visas in an efficient and cost-effective manner is an important element of our competitiveness.  In that context, the relevant Recovery Actions recommended by the Tourism Renewal Group in its Framework for Action put forward several options to explore, having regard to the complexity of immigration policy and administration.As the Deputy will be aware, immigration policy is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and its implementation is a matter for the relevant authorities, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  My Department has engaged with the Department of Justice and Law Reform in relation to these and related issues on an ongoing basis, most recently while following up on the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group.  I have also written directly to my colleague the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern TD, on the matter.  Furthermore, following on from his address to the Irish Hotels Federation at the beginning of March, An Taoiseach, Brian Cowen TD, has also asked the Department of Justice and Law Reform to explore practical solutions to the current difficulties.In addition to contact at Ministerial and Departmental level, I understand that Tourism Ireland has been engaged in active dialogue with the Departments of Justice and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs to develop a visa strategy in relation to tourism and to try to progress certain administrative measures to facilitate tourism from New and Developing Markets.  For example, following a meeting between Tourism Ireland and the Department of Justice in April, I understand that good progress has been made in relation to ADS (Approved Destination Status) groups visiting from China, including the waiving of visa fees to Ireland for groups who already have a UK visa.  I am also advised that it is no longer necessary for a visitor from China to provide a notarised certificate showing they have no criminal record.Tourism Ireland also liaises closely with the visa offices in all of its overseas markets in relation to the level of demand for visas to Ireland and other shared operational issues.  This year, Tourism Ireland, in conjunction with the visa offices in markets such as China and India, is running visa training seminars for the travel trade.  The Deputy will appreciate that migration and border controls are complex and sensitive, affecting not only tourism of various kinds but also labour market policies and inward investment, within the overall context of sovereignty.  However, I am confident that, working in partnership, the immigration authorities and the tourism bodies can ensure that the visitor experiences of Ireland compare well with any of our competitors.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	607	Since my appointment last March as Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport I have not had the opportunity to meet with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to specifically discuss access to broadband facilities, although I obviously meet with all of my Cabinet colleagues on a very regular basis.  The matter of broadband access has however, been raised on a number of occasions at official level since the publication of the Tourism Renewal Group's report in October 2009.As the Deputy will appreciate, the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for electronic communications service providers who operate in a fully liberalised market.  In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where appropriate and possible. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, that Government policy relating to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in "Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", which was published by him in June 2009.The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis and the roll out of the National Broadband Scheme is progressing.  I can assure the Deputy that the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport is fully conscious of the importance of broadband connectivity to tourism businesses and will continue to highlight this to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

As I have previously stated in the House, from a legal perspective, I have no role in the day to day operations of the ISC. Under Section 9 of the Irish Sports Council Act 1999, the Council has to have regard to Government policy and to comply with any general policy directive which may be given by me as the Minister but is not under my control. The Council is established as a corporate entity with legal personality and is responsible for its own activities.However, there is a need to learn from this issue about the relationship between the ISC and the national governing bodies of sport, about the interaction between them and whether other processes should be used.  I am always in favour of using mediation processes where they are available, irrespective of the difficulties, and avoid recourse to the courts if at all possible.  At meetings I have had with the Irish Sports Council, I have made it clear to them that I believe that mediation should always be used in the first instance.

In relation to the National Archives from the policy perspective, I would refer the Deputy to my answer to Questions Nos. 42 and 43 of 19th May last.The principal National Archives storage accommodation is located at its Headquarters offices at Bishop Street and at the Four Courts. It is acknowledged that the National Archives suffers from a long-standing storage challenge on a constrained site.  While efforts have been made to accommodate the State records within its Bishop Street premises, the storage accommodation currently available there does not meet accepted archival standards. Despite this situation, the Director and his staff have made herculean efforts with the cooperation of the OPW to ensure that archives are protected from damage or deterioration.As I indicated on 19th May my Department has asked OPW to investigate the avenues now open for the provision of additional storage facilities to the National Archives either within the current footprint of the warehouse or in the context of the provision of a new archival building. These considerations have become more complex following proposals to merge the National Archives of Ireland, National Library of Ireland and the Irish Manuscripts Commission, and a determination as to whether or not all these institutions, once merged, should be housed together or separately.The cost and the duration of the remedial works to improve the storage facilities for the National Archives, and the estimated cost of an investment in the storage facility so as to fully incorporate it into the archives facilities can not be determined until it is established whether these facilities will be provided in situ in the Bishop Street premises, off-site in a separate storage facility or elsewhere as part of a newly merged body. The provision of such facilities may only be explored within the context of the current budgetary situation and the overall capital priorities of Government.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	611	Whilst my Department provides funding to the National Cultural Institutions, the Board of each Institution is responsible for all operational matters relating to the institution, including opening hours, and I do not have a statutory function in respect of day-to-day operational matters.The opening hours at the National Cultural Institutions is a matter which is kept routinely under review by the institutions.  These bodies are now operating in a much changed financial situation and with reduced Exchequer resources. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the National Archives, the National Library of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland, and the Crawford Art Gallery Cork already open for a full day on Mondays and, therefore, the question of extending opening times to include Mondays does not arise in their case.   Similarly, for the summer period (from 1 May to 30 September) the Chester Beatty Library also opens on Mondays.  The National Gallery and the Crawford Art Gallery Cork also remain open late on Thursdays.  The National Library remains open until 9.00pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The National Concert Hall is, of course, open in the evenings.  All the institutions are open at weekends.Based on information received from the Institutions, my Department estimates that the extension of late opening hours two evenings a week and opening for a half day on Mondays to all of our National Cultural Institutions would cost in the region of an additional €1.3 million a year.  This additional funding would be difficult to secure at the current time.  My Department continues to consult with our National Cultural Institutions in relation to this matter and actively encourages the provision of additional public access within current budgetary constraints.  My Department has also provided funding since 2006 toward Culture Night, when all our National Cultural Institutions remain open until late in the evening, allowing people access to our national collections outside of regular visiting hours.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	612	The Carlow Visual Centre for Contemporary Art project received funding of €3.17 million from my Department's ACCESS programme.  The funding was a contribution towards the construction of a new custom built visual arts centre for large scale artworks and studio space for artists.  The project has received critical acclaim and won the RIAI's award for Best Cultural Building, 2010.  The total project cost was €18 million.  The balance of the funding came from Carlow County Council and fundraising through private sources.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	613	My Department to date has taken a range of measures to optimise the use of resources across its agencies.  There has been considerable re-organisation of tourism structures in the last decade, including the establishment of Tourism Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and the re-organisation of regional tourism structures.  These organisations are aware of the need to ensure maximum return on the funds received from the Exchequer, and this is reflected in the close co-operation between the agencies in their operations as well as in their business planning.In the culture sector, my Department has already considered the benefits that might accrue from the sharing of back-office services.  As a consequence, by Government decision, the National Archives, National Library of Ireland and Irish Manuscripts Commission will be amalgamated into a new body, with enabling legislation currently under preparation in my Department.  It is anticipated that the amalgamation will provide for a more effective use of resources, particularly in the human resource, corporate and information technology sections of these bodies.  The National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland have already outsourced their financial functions, including payroll, to the Financial Shared Services Division of the Department of Justice and Law Reform.In relation to the proposal to combine the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Crawford Art Gallery and National Gallery of Ireland while retaining their separate identities, consideration is being given to the amalgamation of the back-of-house services of the National Gallery of Ireland and the Crawford Art Gallery.  Finally, Culture Ireland is to remain part of the Department rather than be established as a statutory agency and, therefore, continues to avail of the Department's corporate support functions.In the case of the sports sector, it was decided not to proceed with the establishment of the Institute of Sport as a separate entity, so it continues to operate as part of the Irish Sports Council and to avail of its existing support functions.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will examine the scope for any possible further sharing of services in the context of the implementation of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, with a view to optimising the use of resources.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	614	Under the Artists Tax Exemption Scheme, the income accruing to a writer, composer, visual artist or sculptor from the publication, production or sale of his/her work is exempt from income tax.  The Exemption applies to income tax only and does not extend to VAT.  Subsequent to the publication of the Report of the Commission on Taxation last year, my Department engaged extensively with the Department of Finance on this issue.The Finance Act, 2010, introduced a number of changes which restrict the Artists' Exemption (as well as the use of other specified tax reliefs).  A new entry level threshold of €125, 000 at which the High Income Individuals Restriction applies, was introduced from the 2010 tax year.  In addition, the effective rate of income tax for high-income individuals who are fully subject to the restriction, increases from 20% to 30%.  This occurs when adjusted income reached €400,000.  These changes reduce further the number of high earners who benefit from the Artists Exemption.  As the Deputy is aware, the vast majority of those benefiting from the Artists Exemption have exempt earnings equivalent to or lower than the annual income tax exemption limit of €20,000.

Upon completion of the audit and sign off on the accounts by the C&AG, I expect to receive a copy of the annual report and financial statements for 2009 from the Authority.  In accordance with the legislation copies of the report will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	616	Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions lies with the Irish Film Board (IFB).  The Irish Film Board is funded by my Department but it is independent of the Department in its operations.  An Audiovisual Content Production Industry Strategy Framework Group was established by my Department last year. This group will assist in providing a clear vision for the future of the industry and a response to market changes.  The whole area of development of the Irish audiovisual industry (including the computer/video games sector) is being examined by the Group.  I anticipate receipt of the report in the early Autumn.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	617	I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 34 together.Remedial and refurbishment works are to be carried out in the National Gallery of Ireland, specifically to the Dargan and Milltown Wings. Problems with the existing roofs in the historic buildings of the National Gallery have been apparent for some time and they need extensive repair.  The existing roof lights, replaced in the 1940s, need to be upgraded also.  The proposed works will improve the existing conditions, upgrade the daylight control systems in the exhibition spaces and will provide better thermal performance of the roof.  It is anticipated that the works will commence in October 2010.  These works will be funded from the Vote of the Office of Public Works and as they are currently the subject of a competitive tendering process it would undermine the competitiveness of that process to publicly reveal OPW's in house working estimate of the likely cost of these works.  A pre qualification notice was published on www.etenders.gov.ie on 8 June 2010 and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) on 10 June 2010 in connection with the Main and Specialist Contractors with a return deadline of 12 July 2010.The works on the roofs of the historic buildings, which will take about two years, is part of Phase 1 of the Master Development Plan for the National Gallery.  The remainder of the Phase 1 works are dependent on the availability of funding.  We will endeavour to coincide them with the roof works to remaximise economies of scale and cost, optimizate mobilization of construction teams and minimize gallery closures.  I am fully supportive of the Gallery and the Office of Public Works in undertaking this project.  The National Gallery plays an integral part in the cultural life and tourism economy of this State.  This project is necessary to ensure that the historic buildings and the collections of the Gallery are protected for future generations.  In addition, any enhancement of a national cultural institution also enhances the experience available to visitors.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	618	The remit of the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport in relation to tourism is to support the growth of a competitive and sustainable tourism industry, enhancing its contribution to national economic and social goals, through the development, implementation and influencing of a range of policy actions and programmes by the Department, its Agencies and other Government Departments, in consultation with industry partners.There has been a major reform of Irish tourism structures in the last decade with the setting up of Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland as well as reform of the function, role and operational aspects of regional structures.  Fáilte Ireland was established under the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, following the amalgamation of Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT, to encourage, promote and support tourism.  Its primary functions are the development of quality tourism product, domestic tourism marketing, tourism standards, enterprise support, capability building and human resource development for the tourism industry.  Fáilte Ireland makes a vital contribution to the tourism industry in Ireland in delivering on its various functions. Substantial new tourism product has been rolled out, the grading and classification systems for all categories of accommodation, including hotels, has been updated, domestic tourism has increased and many trainees have been skilled to a high standard to enable them to deliver a quality customer service to holidaymakers in Ireland.As part of the Good Friday Agreement, tourism was designated an area for cooperation under the North-South Ministerial Council.  In December 1998, the parties to the Agreement decided that a publicly owned limited company would be established by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the then Bord Fáilte Éireann to carry out functions related to the promotion of tourism to the island of Ireland.  The company, Tourism Ireland Limited, was formally incorporated on 11 December 2000.  Tourism Ireland is accountable to the North South Ministerial Council with funding for its operations being provided by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport in the South. The primary remit of the company is to promote the island of Ireland as a tourist destination in overseas markets.Tourism Ireland is generally regarded as being highly effective, by its international peers as well as the tourism industry on the island.  The company works closely with Fáilte Ireland, NITB, and the tourism industry in delivering its remit.  In summary, Tourism Ireland's role is to maximise the number of visitors coming to the island of Ireland from overseas while Fáilte Ireland's role is to market both domestically and in Northern Ireland and to ensure that the tourism experience in the South is to the highest possible standard.  I am satisfied that both organisations have key complementary roles to play in sustaining the valuable contribution of tourism to Ireland's economy.Turning to the regional level, five Regional Tourism Authorities passed resolutions during the summer of 2006 to dissolve.  The staff, property and responsibilities of these authorities were subsumed into Fáilte Ireland with new Regional Tourism Development Boards being established in each area.  In the case of Dublin, an autonomous body — Dublin Tourism — remains in place.  This is in recognition of Dublin's position as a capital city competing with other European cities for city break visitors. Within the context of the wider changes at regional level, the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Dublin Tourism were substantially altered to address corporate governance issues, to clarify its future role and its relationships with Fáilte Ireland and it is now a subsidiary of Fáilte Ireland.Shannon Development is the Regional Tourism Authority for the Shannon Region which includes Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary and South Offaly.  However, the Region, as is the case with other regions, has a Regional Tourism Development Board.  This Board works closely with the executive of Shannon Development and the main Board of Shannon Development on tourism matters.  The Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport provides funding to Shannon Development to fund promotional and tourism related activities throughout the Shannon Region, although the bulk of its funding is provided through its own resources income.I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the report of the Tourism Renewal Group which was published last October. In his foreword to the report the chairman of the group noted that, in the course of a very wide ranging consultation across the sector, general satisfaction at the performance and delivery of the primary State sector tourism agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, was a consistent theme.  I am satisfied that the institutional framework — while appearing complex — for delivering services to the tourism industry has served us well to date.  At the same time, it is important that the strategic framework for tourism development is flexible enough to respond to the changing economic environment and in this regard the tourism framework is the subject of regular review to ensure it is fit for purpose.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	619	In November 2009, the website www.irishgenealogy.ie was relaunched to include a search facility for the Church records of Baptism, Marriage and Burial for Dublin City and County Kerry.  On Wednesday 16th June 2010 I had the pleasure of launching further Church records on this site (along with His Grace, Dr John R.W. Neill Archbishop of Dublin).  These additional records include Church of Ireland records for Dublin City, Counties Carlow and Kerry and Roman Catholic Records for the County and City of Cork.  The website www.irishgenealogy.ie now hosts over 2 million records of Church Baptism, Marriage and Burial from Counties Carlow, Kerry, Cork and Dublin City.  Work is currently ongoing to add up to a further 1 million Church Baptism, Marriage and Burial records from Dublin City and County Cork and this work should be completed substantially by end 2010 and will then be added to this website.The records which I recently launched also have the corresponding image of the original entry in the Baptism, Marriage or Burial register available to view.  This level of detail, along with the success of the 1901/1911 Census online, will be a significant boost to the "Roots" tourism industry in Ireland, and my Department is working closely with Tourism Ireland to ensure that the availability of these records can act as an incentive to visit Ireland.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 187 and 188 together.My Department and its associated Agencies and Bodies have fully or partially funded thousands of projects in the tourism, culture and sport sectors, details of which can be found on the Department's corporate website at www.tcs.gov.ie or on the websites of the relevant Agencies.  I also meet on an ongoing basis, with tourism, culture and sport interests, including public and private agencies and bodies, with a view to enhancing our national image and promoting sustainable economic development.Tourism is a key element of the Government's wider strategy for economic renewal, and this was reflected in Budget 2010. The overall tourism services budget was increased by 3% from the 2009 outturn to more than €153 million.  Tourism has also been included in cross-cutting measures to support enterprises and jobs, including the Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Credit Review System.  Additional specific measures, such as changes in alcohol excise duties and VAT and the innovative rail travel initiative for senior citizens, will also enhance the sector.To assist the tourism sector, an extensive range of marketing, product development, festival and sporting events, and training and business supports are being put in place by the tourism State agencies under the tourism services budget of the Department.  In marketing the island of Ireland overseas, Tourism Ireland is focusing on major markets that are likely to deliver immediate returns, including Great Britain, Germany and the US.  Tourism Ireland is engaged at present in a huge tactical marketing programme, communicating strong reasons to visit together with clear, price-led messages focusing on the great value to be found here.  Earlier this month, I launched a €20 million summer overseas marketing drive designed to win visitors for the peak season.On the domestic front, Fáilte Ireland has launched a promotional campaign to encourage holidaying at home this year, with a budget of €4 million.  Investment in business, sporting and cultural events is also being increased.  Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are also boosting promotion of business tourism in the build up to the opening, later this year, of the national conference centre in Dublin.  This state-of-the-art facility will further enhance Ireland's capacity to attract international events.  In addition, increased funding has been allocated in 2010 for the continued roll out of Tourism Product Development investment support, leading to the development of improved tourism infrastructure and new and upgraded tourist attractions and activities.The culture, arts and film sectors are also of huge economic importance, and funding by the Department is crucial to supporting employment in these areas.  The Global Irish Economic Forum at Farmleigh recognised that culture is key to Ireland's global reputation and our attractiveness as a place to work, visit and invest.  Cultural tourism is a key element of Ireland's tourism industry.  The list of top visitor attractions is dominated by natural and built heritage, with festivals and musical and other events also attracting major numbers of attendees.The level of funding provided by my Department for cultural development will allow for continued progress of projects already approved under the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS) that commenced in 2001.  Under ACCESS, grants totalling more than €85 million have been awarded for the development of 120 projects throughout the country to develop the arts and culture infrastructure.  ACCESS has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural spaces, and it provides opportunities for local employment as well as attracting cultural tourists to cities and towns throughout the country.The funding provided by my Department to the Irish Film Board has ensured support to meet the demands of the industry in the areas of project and talent development, training and indigenous film and television production.  The industry is a very important one with substantial levels of employment and significant inward investment.  The benefits of high levels of film and television production in Ireland include increased international investment in the economy, increased employment in this sector, positive spin-off effects for promoting Ireland as a tourist destination and the improvement of Ireland as a location for all aspects of creative endeavours.The recent publication by the National Archives, which forms part of my Department, of the 1901 Census Online provides an opportunity to market Ireland as a tourist destination to members of the Irish diaspora who can now find records of their ancestors on the web.  Many may simply be interested in visiting Ireland to see where their ancestors came from, while others may wish to carry out more detailed genealogical research in Ireland.  During visits to New York and London over the next week, I intend to launch the 1901 Census Online in the United States and Britain, and Tourism Ireland will pursue the opportunity further in forthcoming marketing campaigns.Allied to this, my Department hosts the website www.irishgenealogy.ie which contains a web-based search facility for the Church records of baptism, marriage and death.  On 16 June last, I had the pleasure of launching further Church records on this site made up of Church of Ireland records for Dublin City, Counties Carlow and Kerry and Roman Catholic Records for the County and City of Cork.  The website now contains more than 2 million records of Church baptism, marriage and burial from Counties Carlow, Kerry, Cork and Dublin City.  Work is currently ongoing to add up to a further 1 million Church baptism, marriage and burial records from Dublin City and County Cork, and this work should be substantially completed by the end of 2010.To complement cultural tourism initiatives, Culture Ireland's programmes promote Irish arts worldwide, creating new international career and income opportunities which are vital for those working in the Irish cultural sector.  Culture Ireland's showcases at global arts events such as the Edinburgh Festivals, Venice Biennale and Arts Presenters Conference in New York not only generate new international work and investment for Irish artists but also position Ireland as a world leader in creativity and cultural innovation.Sport is also a major contributor to the economy, a contribution which includes sports tourism, ticket sales, subscriptions, the cost of playing sport, together with the purchase of sports equipment and an economic value of time given by volunteers.  In addition, the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company, which is responsible for the development and management of the new Aviva stadium, intends to hold 50 major sporting events in the stadium over a five-year period, which is estimated to generate €2 to 2.5 billion for the economy.In terms of employment, the Irish Sports Council, through its grant funding, supports a large number of jobs throughout the country, including in the order of 1,500 jobs created through the National Governing Bodies of Sport and the Local Sports Partnerships. The Department's capital expenditure on sport is also a major contributor to employment.  It is estimated that the 2009 capital expenditure on the Sports Capital Programme leveraged direct employment of more than 1,700 and indirect employment in the region of 600.  Further employment is created through investment in the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme and major projects such as the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road Stadium.It is evident that through the initiatives/projects supported both at Department and Agency level that the tourism, culture and sport sectors are contributing greatly to the economy of the country.

This agency is funded through my Department and is independent of the Department in its operations.  In terms of value for money, it is worth pointing out that three of the nominations for Academy Awards earlier this year were for projects that were funded by the Irish Film Board and that employment in the Irish audiovisual content production industry was established at over 6,500 in a review carried out for the Irish Film Board.An Audiovisual Content Production Industry Strategy Framework Group was established last year that will assist in providing a clear vision for the future of the industry and response to market changes.  I anticipate receipt of that report in the early Autumn.  Since I was appointed Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, I have met the Chairman and executives of the Irish Film Board. The Irish Film Board has confirmed to me any films designated as Irish, have to meet the relevant co-production treaty rules.

I have also held a number of meetings with Killarney-based staff using the department's video conferencing facilities. I am impressed by how effectively the Department operates from a decentralised location which is only possible with the full co-operation and flexibility of staff. I was also impressed by the new building in Killarney which is located in a very convenient and accessible location in the centre of town. As well as offering very high quality office accommodation for the staff, it is a "green" building with many environmentally friendly and energy saving features.

This review is currently being conducted and it is intended to have the review completed by year end.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	625	Government Policy on the Arts is set out in the Programme for Government and further elaborated in my Department's Statement of Strategy.  My policy is to promote and strengthen the arts, culture and creative sectors in all their forms, increase access to and participation in them, and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life — socially and economically.  It is my aim to continue to implement this policy directly through my own Department and to support the Arts Council, the Film Board, Culture Ireland and our National Cultural Institutions, working within the financial and other resources available to me.The arts and culture sectors are vibrant and vital sectors of our economy; the wellspring, I believe, of many of our creative and innovative enterprises. These sectors are primary economic contributors, real businesses, enduring employers, and differentiators of us as a cultural and tourist destination.  Arts and culture continue to be a uniquely powerful door-opener for Ireland internationally, especially in the United States. Following the Global Economic Forum in Farmleigh last year there has been a special focus at Government level to maximise the opportunities presented by the success of Ireland's artists to use culture as a calling card for Ireland and Irish business.In that context, in March of this year, the Taoiseach appointed actor Gabriel Byrne as a Cultural Ambassador for Ireland.  Culture Ireland is working closely with Gabriel Byrne in promoting Irish arts and culture in the United States and, in particular, in planning a major year-long programme of Irish arts which will take place in the US in 2011.  This year, Culture Ireland has organised a strategic programme of cultural collaborations between Irish and Chinese artists and institutions to mark the Shanghai World Expo.Our National Cultural Institutions continue to attract large numbers of visitors and are an important component of Ireland's business and cultural tourism product. In 2009, over 3 million people visited Cultural Institutions funded by my Department.  The National Gallery is in the top 25 Galleries in Europe and visitor numbers to the National Museum surpass many illustrious contemporary museums in Europe and the USA.  I am glad to say that visitor numbers to our cultural institutions are continuing to grow this year. Indeed, in the month after its re-opening the Natural History Museum had over 23,000 visitors.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	626	The question of the operation and management of swimming pools, including advertising, is entirely a matter for Dublin City Council.  Under the terms of the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, operated by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport grant aid to a maximum of €3.8m is provided to Local Authorities, towards the capital cost of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools.  The current round of the programme closed to applicants on 31 July 2000.Under the programme, 45 pools have been opened throughout the country with a further 12 pools at various stages of development.  Between 1998 and 2009 a sum of almost €143m has been spent under the programme.  This has leveraged a total investment of almost €400m in swimming pools throughout the country.  In the administrative area of Dublin City Council, new pools have been opened in Finglas, Ballyfermot, St. Michael's House (Belcamp Lane Dublin), Ballymun and work is underway on a new pool at Rathmines.The funding which is available to the Department relates to meeting the capital cost of either a new build or refurbishment of swimming pools.  Under the terms of the programme local authorities must meet the costs of normal maintenance and the annual operational costs of swimming pools from their own resources.  I have suggested to the Dublin City Manager that in the light of the new pools which have recently been developed and which have the potential to generate funds, perhaps the Council will be able to increase its subsidy to the pools at Coolock, Sean Mac Dermott Street and Crumlin so that these facilities can continue to be available to the residents in these areas.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	627	The Mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Investment Scheme, which was introduced in section 29 of the Finance Act 2007 and launched in June 2008, provides tax incentives for investment in tourism attractions and facilities in the designated Mid-Shannon Corridor.  The approval and certification of projects under the Scheme is a matter for the Mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Board in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister with responsibility for the tourism portfolio, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The Mid-Shannon Board and the executive teams within Fáilte Ireland and Shannon Development have extensively promoted the Scheme since its commencement.I am advised that, to date, a total of seven applications have been submitted to Fáilte Ireland and Shannon Development for consideration under the Scheme. Five have been approved to date.  The cost to the Exchequer of projects under the Scheme, based on a strict assessment, are in effect nil to date as only one project has reached construction stage.  It is not possible to assess the tax foregone as the project is not yet operational and the final certified construction costs are not available to date.In considering projects for approval, the Mid-Shannon Board is required under the Guidelines for the Scheme to take into consideration all relevant policies and strategies.  In particular the promoters of a proposed project must be able to demonstrate to the Board's satisfaction that the proposed project is in accordance with relevant National Tourism Policy (setting out clearly how the proposed project will contribute to policy objectives), in particular, as laid down in New Horizons for Irish Tourism — An Agenda for Action, Fáilte Ireland’s Tourism Product Development Strategy 2007-13 and the Regional Tourism Development Strategies developed by the relevant Regional Tourism Development Boards and Shannon Development which apply to the Qualifying Area.

All applications received under the Programme are assessed on an individual basis by the Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria as specified in the guidelines, terms and conditions that accompany the application form for the Programme.  These criteria include the likelihood to increase participation and performance in sport, priority of the proposed facility vis a vis existing facilities, disadvantaged status, level of own funding available etc.Every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country, while also affording priority to projects in areas of social and economic disadvantage, and facilitating investment in facilities of regional and national strategic importance.  In this regard, the assessment process also takes into account factors such as the number and quality of the applications received, the amount of funding being sought by each applicant as well as the most recent Census of Population figures.The level of funding for any county is based on the quality, number and size of the applications, the Deputy will be aware that under the Sports Capital Programme the landscape of sporting facilities throughout the country has changed significantly with a range of modern well equipped and well managed facilities now in place.  Since 1998 an amount of €73m has been allocated under the Programme to 7,400 projects.  Work on the National Sports Facilities Strategy 2010-2015, which will provide an improved policy platform for any future rounds of the Programme, is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department.  I expect to receive the draft Strategy shortly. Any future rounds will also be informed by the national audit of local sports facilities that is currently underway.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that there are two outstanding lump sum claims for the company concerned which were received by my Department on 30 October, 2009 and 5 November, 2009.  In the course of processing the claims in question, queries were raised with the employer and I understand that a response on an outstanding query is awaited.In general, the documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor confirming the inability of the company to pay the redundancy entitlements as well as requesting the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.If the required information is provided to the Department, the employees will be paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.

CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial assistance, which are available, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion/Development Grants, and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants.The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise. In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.

In this context, there are a number of financial engineering instruments available to Member States such as JASPERS, JEREMIE, JESSICA and JASMINE. However, these are more suitable to large scale programmes and do not form part of our Structural Funds programmes for 2007 to 2013.  The other major EU Funding which Ireland receives relates to Agriculture i.e. European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) which fall outside this Department's remit. I understand that there is no provision for loan financing under these funds.There are a number of smaller EU funding streams which fall outside the remit of my Department such as in the areas of Environment — LIFE fund for environment and nature, Justice — European Integration Fund and European Refugee Fund, Education — ERASMUS and MARCO POLO and to the SME sector — European Progress Micro Financing Facility amongst others.  I am not aware of any loan financing under these smaller funds but the Deputy might wish to raise it with the Ministers concerned to confirm the position.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a review of small offices in 2009 concluded that there was no longer a need for a full-time, permanent staff presence at Killybegs. This decision was made in the light of the level of demand for Revenue services at that location and modern service delivery channels. Consequently, the official who had been based in Killybegs until his retirement was not replaced at that location.Following discussions with Killybegs based traders, it was agreed that their service requirements would be dealt with from the Revenue office in Donegal Town, which is only 25 kilometres from Killybegs.  A much larger pool of staff is available at Donegal Town to ensure continuity and consistency of service and to deliver a broader range of customer services from that location. Where necessary, an officer from Donegal Town attends at Killybegs by appointment, if physical presence is needed for any particular transaction.  A recent review of the new arrangements has concluded that the service currently being provided is meeting the needs of customers in the Killybegs area.Revenue enforcement staff continue to cover Killybegs Port as part of their ongoing patrols, while the Customs Cutters patrol the coastline. The attendance of enforcement personnel is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators. Revenue continuously assesses the risk along the Donegal coast, including any small ports and other landing places, for the illegal importation of drugs and tobacco products.  Attendance at Ports can also be as a result of specific intelligence. Customs officers liase with local Gardai, Harbour Masters and Coastguard Officers regarding drugs and with trade interests in respect of fiscal products.As part of the Customs Drugs Watch programme, a confidential 24/7 free phone is promoted and maintained as a communications channel for the maritime and coastal communities to report suspicious activity. While there is constant monitoring of the Donegal coastline, it is not the policy of the Revenue Commissioners to publish details of such enforcement activities. Neither does Revenue publish the number or location of Customs staff trained in the detection of illegal drugs as this could prejudice current or future operations.In terms of maritime surveillance, there are currently two Customs Cutters in service, the RCC Suirbhéir and the RCC Faire and these support our teams of land-based enforcement officers involved in anti-smuggling duties. Patrols of the Ports by the Cutters are kept under constant review to take account of available intelligence and emerging smuggling trends. The Cutters spend a significant amount of their time patrolling the north west in execution of plans drawn up by the local risk assessment personnel.  Based on current risk profiles, it is not envisaged that a Customs cutter will be assigned on a permanent basis to patrol the north west coast.In addition to national patrolling and surveillance activities, the Customs Service participates in a number of international Joint Surveillance Operations each year. In 2008 the Commissioners assigned a Customs Officer to the Maritime Operations and Analysis Centre — Narcotics in Lisbon, Portugal. This centre, which is supported by the US authorities, is playing a leading role in the fight against the trafficking of drugs, particularly cocaine, into the EU from South America and also from West Africa, which is increasingly being used as a staging post.  Revenue's Customs Service continues to work proactively with an Garda Síochána and the Naval Service as part of the Joint Task Force on Drugs Interdiction. The Commissioners are satisfied that the current arrangements for maritime and coastal surveillance are sufficient and effective and currently have no plans for the acquisition or deployment of additional cutter resources.

My engineering staff advise me that the breach in the weir does not increase the risk / worsen the flooding in the area and therefore it does not pose any threat to the village of Ardfinnan. I should also point out that the Office of Public Works has made funds available to the Local Authority, under the Minor Works Scheme, to enable them to carry out flood alleviation works in the Ardfinnan area. Works include: cleaning out the bridge, strengthening the riverbank, raising the existing embankment and removal of in-stream vegetation. It is envisaged that these works will be completed in the current year.

The full amount of this refund was paid in two separate payments, which issued on 14 October 2009 and 26 February 2010 respectively. Following the receipt of additional details, a further review was completed in March 2010. A Balancing Statement which set out the up-to-date position was issued by the Revenue Commissioners to the taxpayer's husband, as the assessable spouse, on 1 April 2010.In addition, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no record of an application for a refund of income levy having been received in respect of the person in question. In the absence of a completed Income Levy Refund Claim Form, it will not be possible to determine that person's entitlement to such a refund. Accordingly, the local Revenue District Office has recently issued a copy of the relevant form to the taxpayer by post in order that this issue can be progressed.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	650	In light of the health risks associated with the consumption of a number of substances commonly referred to as  'legal highs' and which were on sale in head shops, the Government made an Order on 11 May declaring a large number of these substances to be controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, with immediate effect. Approximately 200 individual substances were controlled by this legislation and it is now a criminal offence for a person to import, export, produce, supply or possess these legal high substances. This legislation has had a significant impact on headshops, removing the vast majority of their products from the market, and as a consequence a large number of headshops have closed.The Government has always acknowledged that attempts would be made to circumvent these regulations.  Since these substances were brought under control, other substances have been coming onto the market that are currently not subject to controls under the Misuse of Drugs Act. My Department is working closely with the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Gardaí, the Customs Service, the Forensic Science Laboratory, the Irish Medicines Board, and others to monitor closely the emergence of new psychoactive substances. I will not hesitate to seek Government approval to ban additional substances if any of them pose a risk to public health.Initial analyses indicate that the products 'WHACK' and 'Amplified' contain new cocaine-type substances. As these substances have anaesthetic effects they may be considered to fall within the scope of the medicinal products legislation. These products do not hold licences from the IMB or the European Medicines Agency. The IMB has been inspecting head shops and taking action to have these, and products similarly considered to fall within the scope of the medicinal products legislation, removed from the market. My colleague the Minister for Justice and Law Reform last Friday published the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill 2010. This bill will make it a criminal offence to sell or supply substances which may not be specifically controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts but which have psychoactive effects.

I understand that the child care facility referred to by the Deputy is participating in the new ECCE scheme and that to date capitation funding in the region of €95,000 has been allocated by my Office to the facility to enable it to provide the free pre-school year.  As the query relates to the withdrawal of funding previously received by the service from the Health Service Executive (HSE), I have referred the matter to it for investigation and for direct reply to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	668	The public pandemic vaccination campaign came to an end on 31st March 2010. Following a full assessment of the current situation, the risks of a second wave, the availability of vaccine and other factors, the National Public Health Emergency Team decided, following advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, that those in the "at risk" group should continue to be vaccinated. This means that up to September 2010, the vaccine will continue to be available free of charge through GPs and Maternity Units to these particular groups. The vaccine will also be available to those travelling to the southern hemisphere during the upcoming influenza season.The H1N1 vaccines used in Ireland were Pandemrix and Celvapan and it is estimated that 1.1 million doses have been administered in Ireland to date.  The Irish Medicines Board is aware of six children who inadvertently received adult doses of Pandemrix in error. Of these, 3 cases reported no adverse reaction, the others who showed symptoms have all recovered without consequence. IMB is working very closely with its European and international partners in monitoring vaccine safety. At least 42.3 million people have been vaccinated in the European Economic Area and the balance of risks and benefits for the centrally authorised H1N1 vaccine remains positive.The HSE regional project managers were responsible for coordinating the response to clinical and operational/administrative incidents. The case raised by the Deputy was handled in my Department in line with the Patient Safety Protocol that I set up in September 2008.  The Protocol is managed by the Chief Medical Officer on my behalf as a medical assessment of any potential patient safety issues is required.  In accordance with the Protocol, the Health Service Executive has investigated the case and made a report to my office, a copy of which has issued to the parents of the child in question. The HSE has expressed regret at the incident and has invited the parents to contact a named official if they have any further concerns.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	669	I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.In 2008, payments to General Practitioners (GPs) for services provided under the GMS scheme totalled approximately €460 million.  In addition, GPs were paid approximately €15m in respect of other schemes. Figures in respect of 2009 are not yet available.  In the same year, payments to pharmacies amounted to approximately €1,628 million.  This included €1,145 million under the GMS scheme, €315 million under the Drugs Payment Scheme and €138 million under the Long Term Illness Scheme. These figures include the ex-factory costs of the medicines supplied, which amounted to approximately €1,205m, plus any applicable wholesale and retail mark-ups and dispensing fees.In 2009 I made a number of regulations under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to reduce the fees and allowances payable to health professionals, including GPs and pharmacists.  In the case of pharmacists, this included reductions in the wholesale and retail mark-ups paid on medicines supplied under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  It is understood from the Health Service Executive (HSE) that savings in the region of €16 million and €60 million were achieved from the reductions in payments to GPs and pharmacy contractors respectively during 2009.As required by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, I have commenced a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the revised fees and allowances.  In February this year price reductions of 40% were agreed for a large number of medicines supplied by Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association member companies. In addition, the rebate paid to the HSE in respect of drugs supplied under the GMS scheme has been extended to include all community drugs schemes and increased from 3.53% to 4%. The combination of these measures plus consequent savings in wholesale and retail mark-ups are expected to result in savings of approximately €94m in a full year.I am confident that the combination of measures being applied this year in the community pharmacy sector will save over €200 million on what otherwise would have been the cost to the Exchequer.

The Faculty of Radiology, in conjunction with the HSE, has developed a national guideline which sets out the circumstances in which it is appropriate for X-rays to be read by a radiologist or by another clinician.  This guideline has been communicated to all hospitals and is being implemented.  This will require that hospitals develop standardised operating practices and systems for audit. The HSE will also audit the operation of these standardised operating practices in hospitals quarterly in future.

However, the HSE service plan for 2010 cites a projected 2009 outturn of 85% for the percentage of children in care who had a written care plan as defined by child care regulations 1995.The Implementation Plan for the recommendations of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was accepted by Government and published in July 2009. One of the key recommendations of the Implementation Plan is that an additional 270 additional social workers be recruited by the HSE between 2009 and 2011 in order that the HSE can fulfil its care planning and other statutory obligations to children in care.  This is made possible as the approved Employment Control Framework for the HSE exempts social worker posts from the current moratorium on recruitment and the filling of vacancies.  An amount of some €14m has been provided to the HSE in the current year to progress the implementation of the recommendations of the Ryan Commission.

The arrangements in place are not subject to residency and means criteria and such persons may avail of public health services on the same basis as medical card holders, while awaiting a decision on an application to remain in this country.  Asylum seekers are given medical cards for the period during which their application for refugee status is being considered.  In such circumstances, a choice of doctor may be offered or a general practitioner may be assigned to the direct provision centre by the HSE, depending on the availability of General Medical Services (GMS) contract holders in the area.  If refugee status is subsequently granted, then the person is regarded as ordinarily resident and comes under the usual rules for entitlement to health services.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	698	I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive (HSE) established a Working Group to develop a national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services.  Its terms of reference include the development of an appropriate policy framework for neuro-rehabilitation and a preferred model of care for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services.The policy development has been informed at all stages by the new delivery structures being developed by the HSE.  In its considerations, the Working Group identified the importance of timely access to prosthetic and orthotic services.  The final report of the Working Group will recommend that this matter needs to be addressed by the Health Service Executive.As the issues raised by the Deputy regarding the HSE revision of rehabilitation services and management of prosthetic and orthotic services are matters for the consideration of the Health Service Executive, I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	712	The status of diplomatic and other staff of foreign missions, including private domestic workers or private servants employed by diplomats, is governed by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 which, under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, has the force of law in the State.  The Convention provides that the sending state must notify the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or such other ministry as may be agreed, in the receiving state of the arrival and departure of diplomatic staff, their family members and private servants and the engagement and discharge of persons resident in the receiving state as members of the mission or private servants entitled to privileges and immunities.Visa rules provide that citizens of certain countries require a visa to travel to Ireland and where such persons come within the Convention and are posted to Ireland they must obtain an Irish visa prior to entry to the State.  There are no particular conditions attached to the visa granted other than that it has been issued for the purpose of allowing the person to take up the assignment.The Immigration Act 2004 provides that a person who is entitled to privileges and immunities under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 is not subject to the 2004 Act.  However, once admitted to Ireland, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service will, at the request of the Department of Foreign Affairs, place in the person's passport an endorsement confirming his or her status in the State.  The person concerned is not required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  The person is expected to leave the State once the assignment is at an end.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Based on the information provided by the Deputy and in the absence of specific detail, I am unable to provide a substantive response.  I can however advise that it is the general policy of the Visa Office, Beijing to refuse visas to a group of individuals travelling together where one individual in the party submits false, fraudulent or misleading information.  The discovery of false, fraudulent or misleading information in one application as part of a group can lead to a legitimate and reasonable concern in respect of the other group members' documentation and the reliability of the group as a whole.  This is particularly the case where the group concerned are represented by a third party or agent.  There may be exceptions to this general policy, depending on the particular circumstances of the case and the track record of any institution involved.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 157 together.As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question 157 of 9 June 2010, Visa Officers are provided with on the job training and support by more experienced Visa Officers in the section.  This approach is considered to be the most logical and indeed best suited to delivering a quality customer service to visa required nationals.In general, a percentage of decisions made by Visa Officers are reviewed each month by an official at a more senior level for quality assurance purposes.  Also, in line with best practice, where a visa has not been granted the applicant is afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision of the Visa Officer.  It should be borne in mind that visa applications are sometimes refused because the applicants have neglected to include all the necessary documents required in order to assist the Visa Officer in arriving at a decision.  I am satisfied that Visa Officers of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service carry out their functions in a consistent and careful manner and that decisions on visa applications are made in an objective manner.Each application is considered on its individual merits based on the documentation/evidence provided by the applicant.  It is always the case that the onus rests with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why a visa should be granted.  In order to assist visa applicants, guidelines on the visa process including details of the documents required are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).  On the basis of the above, I am satisfied that the functions carried out by the Visa Section of the Irish Naturalisation Service are in line with international standards and best practice.Where an applicant seeks a visa for the purpose of study, one key consideration of the Visa Officer is to assess the educational qualifications and, in certain instances, the proficiency in English of a visa applicant.  Critically, the applicant must provide evidence that they have attained the necessary level of academic achievement required to follow their chosen course.  If the applicant does not have the appropriate standard of English, it calls into question the credibility of the applicant.  Evidence that a visa officer takes into consideration, in this regard, includes exam results, qualifications obtained and certificates attesting that the applicant possesses the required level of English.With regard to establishing proficiency in English, it is recommended that applicants, regardless of nationality or educational background, undertake the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) English Language Test.  Where proficiency is established, applicants are advised to provide original certification of this with their visa application.  Proficiency in English is not a prerequisite where a visa application is solely for an English language course.  A Visa Officer will however seek to establish whether or not the proposed course is consistent with the applicant's general academic or work background, based on the documentation provided by the applicant.   Essentially the educational qualifications and proficiency in English of an individual is established on the basis of the certification and documents provided by the applicant.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	715	I am informed by the Garda authorities that members of An Garda Síochána enforce the law on cycling on footpaths on an ongoing basis as part of their normal duties.  In addition to the day to day enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, breaches of the legislation in respect of pedal cycle behaviour is regularly targeted by way of various Garda operations.  I am also informed that, where breaches of the legislation are detected, members of An Garda Síochána, depending on the circumstances, may deal with the incident by way of advice or caution or by initiating criminal proceedings.Educational talks are regularly given by members of the Regional Road Safety Units and through the Garda Schools Programme on road safety and road traffic legislation, including on cycling, to young people and other identified high-risk road users to encourage increased compliance.  The issuing of convictions and penalties is a matter for the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	716	The Garda Síochána Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit, operating within the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, is responsible for the investigation of criminal offences involving child pornography.  The Unit contains trained specialists and can be augmented by personnel from other units of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation if required.I am informed by the Garda authorities that any suspected offence involving the abuse of children through the internet or other technology, whether originating in this jurisdiction or coming to the attention of An Garda Síochána through international agencies or by any other means, is subject to thorough investigation and cooperation by An Garda Síochána.  Specialist computer software is available to An Garda Síochána and is utilised to gather information and intelligence on possible suspects operating in this jurisdiction.  The resources available for the investigation of this type of crime are continuously monitored by the Garda authorities, and I am informed that they are currently considered to be sufficient.The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 provides penalties for child pornography offences which I consider to be robust.  The offence of knowingly possessing child pornography attracts a maximum prison sentence of five years or a maximum fine of €6,350 or both.  The maximum penalty for knowingly producing, distributing, printing, publishing, importing, exporting, showing or selling child pornography is a maximum prison sentence of 14 years or an unlimited fine or both.The internet is a worldwide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  There is, however, an existing self-regulatory framework for internet service providers (ISPs) in operation in Ireland which actively encourages the adoption of best practice procedures aimed at limiting the proliferation of illegal child pornography content online.  Members of the public may report such material to the www.hotline.ie service of the Internet Service Providers' Association of Ireland (ISPAI).  If the material is hosted here and deemed to be illegal and in contravention of Irish law, ISPAI members are obliged to remove such materials.  If the material is hosted in another jurisdiction, it is notified to the internet hotline in that jurisdiction and/or to the relevant law enforcement agencies for follow up, with the aim of having illegal content taken down.At present all of the mobile phone operators in Ireland, under a voluntary agreement brokered by the European Commission with the GSM Alliance Europe, the association representing European mobile phone operators, implement a form of filtering on their mobile internet service, which prevents access to websites which have been identified as containing child pornography content.In a number of EU Member States, a system of internet blocking/filtering has been introduced on a voluntary basis, whereby a "blocklist" of sites containing child pornography is made available by the police or other competent authorities, and is utilised by individual ISPs to prevent access to such content.  A number of other Member States have introduced or are considering the introduction of legislation requiring ISPs to block access to websites containing child pornography.  It is generally acknowledged that all such internet blocking or filtering systems are not foolproof and can be circumvented in certain circumstances.  However, such filtering systems are understood to be useful in preventing internet users from inadvertently encountering such illegal content.The issue of the possible utilisation of blocking/filtering methodologies to prevent access to identified webpages containing child pornography is being considered further by my Department's Office for Internet Safety with advice from the Internet Safety Advisory Council.  In undertaking research in this area, the Office for Internet Safety has had discussions with a variety of relevant interests in relation to the possibility of introducing internet filtering, specifically in respect of illegal child pornography content, in Ireland.  However, I should make it clear that no decisions have been arrived at on this issue of internet filtering/blocking at national level.  Any proposals for introducing such a system would need, at the very least, to be submitted to Government for consideration.  The introduction of any such system, particularly if on a mandatory basis, may require the introduction of primary legislation.However, a draft proposal for a Directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography was published recently by the European Commission.  The draft Directive contains a proposal to require Member States to implement some form of blocking system in relation to websites containing child pornography.  Ireland's participation in the adoption and implementation of this measure is subject to Government and Oireachtas approval.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.

Local Garda management is aware that two dogs have died in this area in the last 18 months.  However, no complaint has been made to An Garda Síochána in this regard, and there is no evidence to suggest criminal behaviour.  Any such incident reported to An Garda Síochána will be investigated.I am further informed that a report was made to An Garda Síochána in respect of an item which was found in the garden of a house in the area and which was suspected to contain a poisonous substance.  The item has been sent for forensic analysis, the results of which are awaited.  This incident remains under Garda investigation.

I am further informed that local Garda management is not aware of any incidents of the type referred to by the Deputy having occurred.  Any such incident reported to An Garda Síochána will be investigated.  The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, Including the Community Policing Unit, the Garda Mountain Bike Unit and the local Detective and Drugs Units, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  Current policing strategies are designed to prevent crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour, and community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy.  Community policing is a central feature of policing policy.  This will ensure an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.

All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

The letter referred to in the Deputy's question was not provided with this application. Reference to a further application lodged on 11 June 2010 relates to an email communication from the person concerned addressed to INIS seeking the renewal of this travel document.It is open to the person in question to submit a new application for a temporary travel document accompanied by the relevant supporting documentation to the Travel Document Unit of INIS which is located at 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.  Full information in this regard and the application form is available on the INIS website which is www.inis.gov.ie.

This permission expired on 14 June, 2010 and she is therefore advised to attend her local Immigration Office in order to have that permission to remain in the State renewed, if she has not already done so.With regard to the issue of possible of family reunification raised by the Deputy, I wish to make clear that the granting of permission to remain in the State under the IBC/05 Scheme does not confer any entitlement or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related to the person granted permission or not, to enter or remain in the State. All applicants granted permission to remain under the Scheme signed an undertaking to this effect.  It is, however, open to all non-EEA nationals, who are resident outside the State, and who are visa-required to enter the State, to apply to their nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate for an entry visa. Comprehensive guidelines on making a visa application can be found on the website www.inis.gov.ie.

The person concerned is the subject of a  Deportation Order following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim, and a comprehensive and thorough examination of the representations he submitted for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).The person concerned submitted an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of his marriage to an Irish national, which was refused. The person concerned also submitted an application for residency under EU Treaty Rights. This was refused as the spouse of the person concerned is an Irish citizen and therefore Directive 2004/38/EC does not apply.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

The person concerned now falls to be considered for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned. Due to the high volume of cases on hands, it is not possible to say when the case of the person concerned will be finalised.  However, the Deputy can be assured that this case will be processed to completion as soon as possible.

As it is incumbent on an applicant to notify my Department when they change address it would be in the best interest of the person concerned to inform my Department of his correct address without delay.
I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy has no application pending for residency.  The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim, and a comprehensive and thorough examination of the representations he submitted for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  He has been evading his deportation since September 2009 and should he come to the notice of the Gardaí, he would be liable to arrest and detention.  He should, therefore, present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without any further delay.

In international trade negotiations, the Commission negotiates on behalf of the Union, on the basis of a mandate that it receives from the Council.  On 1 March, negotiations on a Multiparty Free Trade Agreement between the EU and two member states of the Andean Community — Colombia and Peru — concluded in Brussels.  The conclusion of the negotiations was noted by Heads of State and Government at the EU- Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Madrid on 18 May.The Commission will, in due course, bring forward proposals to the Council authorising the signature and conclusion of the EU- Andean Multiparty Trade Agreement.  The issue of the designation of the Agreement as one which involves mixed competence requiring approval and ratification by all 27 Member States or one in which the Union has exclusive competence will be determined in the light of analysis of its content and of legal advice when the Commission has submitted its proposals to the Council.  In any event, the approval of the European Parliament will be required before the Agreement can be signed and ratified.

My Department is fully compliant with the Department of Finance guidelines on foreign travel and also operates its own detailed internal travel guidelines which ensure cost effective travel practises.  The central aim of the Departmental travel policy is to minimise official travel costs and to achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.In my Department, a General Entertainment budget is provided for various types of expenses incurred by Divisions of my Department including entertainment costs incurred in relation to the Irish Aid programme.  My Department takes all appropriate measures to ensure that costs are kept as low as possible.  The Department's practice with regard to the appropriate level of entertainment provided is based on agreed EU Guidelines and on reciprocity. There have been significant reductions in the budgets assigned for general and state entertainment in recent years.  The current budget for entertainment reflects a 30% reduction on the 2009 figure, which in turn represented a reduction of 11% on the preceding year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	738	The Deputy may be aware that my colleague, Minister of State Mansergh spoke recently on this matter in the Seanad.  From my perspective, as a former Minister for Education and Science, I can recognise and appreciate the benefits of the widest possible experiences being available to students.  Included in these experiences must be interaction with the arts.  It was this recognition which prompted the commissioning of a Report from the Arts Council to examine this vital topic.It should be noted that within the constraints of the existing system, the education and arts sectors co-operate fully to ensure the optimal delivery of services.  The artists in schools guidelines issued to schools, which were developed by the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council working in partnership, are an important resource in informing schools of how best to plan, implement and evaluate partnerships with local artists and organisations which will provide stimulating and interesting learning experiences for children.  They encapsulate the vision of arts in education practice which is set out in the points of alignment report.There can be no argument as to the fact that providing the arts with a higher and more consistent profile at primary and post-primary level can benefit the students concerned significantly with consequent benefits to society.  It is important to stress that this applies to all students and not just those recognised as being gifted artistically.  Given that, as is the case in sport, the future of the arts resides with our children, we recognise the importance of the exposure of students to the arts at all levels in our education system.The Arts Council has pursued at all times a policy of engaging with young people, whether through its specific programmes or by its support of organisations specialising in arts in education interventions, such as The Ark and Team in Dublin, and of theatrical groups.  This is supplemented too by the Education and Outreach programmes run by all of our National Cultural Institutions and other agencies funded by my Department.  It is intended, when resources permit, to revisit the proposed actions in this report.

While no decision has been made on the timing of the next round of the SCP, €48 million has been provided in my Department's Vote in the 2010 Estimates to cover payments to be made from the C1 subhead, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities in respect of previously awarded grants.  It is expected that all of this funding will be paid out to sports clubs and organisations this year.As the drawdown of outstanding allocations is dependent on the timely receipt of invoices and other documentation from the grantees it is not possible to predict the exact amount of SCP drawdown from any county during a particular period of time.  The figures for payments under the SCP on projects funded under the programme up to and including 2008 for each of the last three years are set out in the table below:YearTotal ExpenditureKildare€€200958,738,3371,654,421200860,137,146687,451200763,719,9861,031,964Under the Local Authority Swimming Pools Programme (LASPP) a provision of €7.5m has been made in 2010 which will be sufficient to meet existing commitments under current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, including payments of €380,921.40 for projects funded in County Kildare.  No decision has been made on the timing of a new round of the programme.

Details of allocations made to projects in Co. Kildare under the SCP are available on the Department's website — www.tcs.ieThe Deputy will be aware that the Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by the Department, has a statutory role in the promotion, development and coordination of sport.  The ISC was established on a statutory basis on 1st July, 1999, and the functions of the Council are outlined in Section 6 of the Irish Sports Council Act 1999.  Section 6 (1)(a) states that one of the functions of the Council shall be "to encourage the promotion, development and coordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport."  Section 6.1 (b) states, as one of the functions of the Council, that the ISC has responsibility for developing "strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and to coordinate their implementation by all bodies (including public authorities and publicly funded bodies) involved in promoting recreational sport and providing recreational facilities.  Details of spending by the ISC in Co. Kildare, primarily in respect of Co. Kildare LSP is available from the Irish Sports Council.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	743	As the Deputy will be aware, the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established in 2002 against a background of concern at the multiplicity of structures and agencies through which local and community development schemes and programmes were delivered. It inherited a number of local and community programmes with diverse structures, which had been operated under the aegis of several different Departments. Clearly, there was an inherent danger of fragmentation of services and the diffusion of resources.The cohesion process initiated some years ago to address these issues resulted in a significant reduction of local delivery structures for a range of rural and local development programmes. Until last year, there were almost 100 partnerships/local development companies and LEADER companies operating. The cohesion process has resulted in that number being reduced to a total of 52 entities providing full county-wide coverage across the country.My Department still has a wide agenda of reform to advance. The next phase, which is under way, concerns improving and joining up the outputs of programmes, as well as further consolidating structures.  The Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme (LDSIP and CDP) were my Department's two main social inclusion and community development programmes and were delivered through separate local delivery structures. These programmes came to an end on 31 December 2009 and were superseded by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).As the Deputy is aware, an implementation strategy involving the stakeholders is underway for LCDP roll-out over the course of 2010. Integrated workplans have now been developed by the local development companies and the CDPs covering all local development company areas. The next phase to the end of June covers the development of local integration plans for reduced structures from January 2011.A key difference between the new LCDP and its predecessor programmes is the fact that, when fully implemented, it will be delivered nationally on an integrated basis by a reduced number of companies. My Department has set out a national model for integrated service delivery and structures at a local level, which would involve, among other things, the re-constitution of the voluntary CDP boards from the end of 2010. Each board would then form an advisory committee to the local development company and act as the voluntary management committee for the local project. This approach will preserve the community development ethos in areas and will not detract from the key essential services and supports being provided through the CDP. In addition, the new programme will enable groups to more objectively demonstrate the positive impacts and outcomes they are securing to meet the needs of local communities.As I have previously indicated, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department — especially those providing tangible benefits for the most disadvantaged communities — are protected.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	744	I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.As the Deputy is aware, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme were my Department's two main social inclusion/community development programmes. These came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP). A key difference between the new LCDP and its predecessor programmes is the fact that, when fully implemented, it will be delivered nationally on an integrated basis by a reduced number of companies.As the Deputy is aware, my Department has set out a national model involving full integration of CDPs with local development companies (LDCs), but has made it clear that other options can be considered and that it is not a question of ‘one size fits all'.  The only option not acceptable is one that seeks to preserve the status quo: some models proposed by CDPs and other parties in the period since the launch of the LCDP have had to be rejected on that basis. However, my Department has been able to respond positively to a number of other alternative models put forward by both LDCs and CDPs.While agreement has not yet been fully finalised in these cases, I am satisfied that the real possibility for agreement exists. It is anticipated that such models, if agreed, would be for use in a small number of specific areas only. Additional proposals from other CDPs and LDCs are also being examined but are less developed at this stage.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that my Department will continue to respond positively to all constructive proposals that it receives and that my officials will continue to be available to meet with the boards of projects.All CDPs and LDCs that are currently in receipt of funding through the LCDP have signed up to implement the programme in the context of my Department's full integration strategy and to meet specified deadline dates (submission of workplan by 26 March 2010 and of integration plan by 30 June 2010).  The position is that, unless a project has received provisional approval from my Department for an alternative LCDP integration model, groups are still required to submit their plans for full integration by 30 June. It is not anticipated that there will be any general extension to that deadline.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	745	My Department is committed to the ongoing development of supports to strengthen and underpin the work of the community and voluntary sector in Ireland. Indeed, the growth of the sector in recent years has been accompanied by a significant expansion of supports by Government.Policy initiatives are underpinned by the ‘Towards 2016' Partnership Agreement and the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity, which recognises the valuable role of the community & voluntary sector. The agreement notes that the great strength of voluntary activity is that it emerges organically from communities and points out that while the Government should not seek to control and be involved in every aspect of voluntary activity, it does have a responsibility to provide an enabling framework to help the sector.My Department manages a broad range of schemes and programmes that support the wider community & voluntary sector. Details of these are available on my Department's website — www.pobail.ie. While, as the Deputy is aware, the Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector is currently under review in my Department, all organisations involved in the scheme are being consulted as part of the review process. Such a consultative and constructive approach is also a strong feature of other interactions between my Department and the sector (e.g. in relation to the area of charity regulation) and I anticipate that this will continue to be the case in the future.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	746	Funding contracts under the scheme referred to by the Deputy are due to expire on 31 December 2010.  Officials in my Department are currently carrying out a review of the scheme and I hope that this process will be completed by the autumn.  On the basis of the findings of the review, I will consider the options available to me.  All organisations involved in the scheme are being consulted as part of the review process.  It should be noted that I am planning to meet this week with representatives of ‘Voices that Matter', a grouping of national networks and organisations in the sector.

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.To qualify for payment of FIS a person must be engaged in full time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.FIS is then calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the net income of the person(s) raising the children.  Net income for FIS purposes comprises of total family income less tax, employee PRSI, health contribution, income levy, superannuation contribution and pension levy.

Issues relating to the tenants of local authorities are appropriate to my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

The file was then forwarded to the Social Welfare Local Officer on the 4th February 2010 for further investigation of means.  In order to determine his entitlement to the pension, the person concerned was asked on two occasions to provide a number of documents.  Unfortunately, the Department has no record of this information being received.  If he submits the required documentation to the Department his entitlement to a State pension (non-contributory) will be determined as quickly as possible.

The scheme covers courses of education from second level to Higher Diploma level in any discipline [level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)] and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching; level 9 in NFQ) which add significantly to a person's employability.  Other postgraduate qualifications such as a Master's (level 9) or Doctoral degrees (level 10) are not included.A small number of cases have arisen where a college has granted an exemption from the requirement to hold a primary degree and has admitted a person to a Master's course on the basis of relevant life experience.  In the context of the ongoing review of the operation of the scheme, it was decided to extend entitlement to back to education allowance in these instances on an exceptional basis.The potential for further changes in certain areas was identified by my predecessor to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  These concerned duration, access to post-graduate courses, appropriateness of courses and progression.  The final shape and scope of such changes are currently under consideration.  The nature and structure of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, is responsible for administration of the student maintenance grant schemes.

Setting or retaining maximum rent limits at a higher level than are justified can have a distorting effect on the rental market and worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.The new limits will ensure that different categories of eligible households can continue to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that exist in various parts of the country. The couple rates are established based on market rates for one bedroom apartments. The single rate includes other accommodation types more suitable to single person's requirements including bed-sits and studio apartments. Couple accommodation type units tend to be larger than single person accommodation units throughout the State; this reflects the variance between the two rates. The shared accommodation limits are based on the cost of renting a room appropriate to the individuals needs. The one parent family with one child rate allows for the family to secure a two bedroom apartment if required reflecting the variance between the single and couple rates.  Where circumstances arise, limits can be exceeded if the relevant Community Welfare Officer considers it appropriate.

Local authorities are prioritising action to ensure that these obligations are discharged and that sites within their areas are properly secured from public access and, where necessary, are made structurally sound.  In this regard, existing legislation such as the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and Litter Act 1997 — 2003, along with planning legislation, can be used to ensure developers and the owners of sites engage with local authorities in addressing specific difficulties.  We will also keep the need for further legislative reforms to assist local authorities on this issue under review.The interpretation of the planning responsibilities of financial institutions in relation to the completion of developments of which they have taken ownership is a matter for the financial institution concerned and the relevant planning authority and ultimately for the Courts to decide in relation to any case that may come before it.  A range of actions are being progressed by my Department, with the co-operation of local authorities and other key stakeholders, to address the issue of unfinished or unoccupied estates. These actions include an accurate quantification, classification and mapping of the various types of unfinished or unoccupied estates on a county by county basis to understand the scale and distribution of the problem.A best practice policy manual is also being prepared to identify the necessary responses to ensure satisfactory outcomes in tackling difficulties on specific sites in a coordinated and pro-active manner.  The responses will require a range of interventions across a number of disciplines — there are issues of public safety, the provision of bonds and securities, environmental protection, building control and estate management.

It is a matter for local authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority's rent scheme.  Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.  Notwithstanding this, in the context of new provisions provided for by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, I intend to make regulations later this year which will more clearly set out the matters that may be included in a local rents scheme.

However, Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level Colleges and Universities in the State and any other E.U. Member State. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from a candidate's local tax offices or on Revenue's website at http://www.revenue.ie.

These schools, once recognised, will provide education for children with autism in line with my Department's policy.  Detailed modalities relating to the transfer of staff are under consideration and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further in this regard.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	799	My Department recently approved funding for the provision of 1 mainstream classroom at the school referred to by the Deputy. I understand that the School Authorities have informed officials in my Department's Building Unit and they will be submitting an application to have additional works carried out at the school. As soon as this application is received it will be considered and the school authorities informed of the outcome.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	800	I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 257 together.I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2 rating. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department's website at ww.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.  My Department has no record of receiving correspondence from the school concerning subsidence in the main school building.  On receipt of such information my Department will consider the school's needs.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	801	As the Deputy may be aware, the recognition of qualifications for teacher registration is now a matter for the Teaching Council, the body with statutory responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards in the teaching profession in the State.  Any enquiry regarding the recognition of a particular qualification should, therefore, be made directly to the Teaching Council.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	802	The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  The Deputy may be aware that a Common Application System (CAS) was agreed between the principals of the post-primary schools in Limerick City. This system has been facilitated through the Limerick Education Centre (LEC) with support from my Department. This administrative system ensures that a coordinated approach can be taken to enrolments in the area.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. An appeal under Section 29, for the person mentioned in the question, has been taken to my Department, however, the appeal was not upheld.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	804	As part of the expansion of the Permanent Accommodation Scheme 2007, a grant was allocated to the school in question to enable the management authority provide 3 additional mainstream classrooms.  I understand that some difficulties arose between the school and the design team/contractor, however, as this is a devolved project it is a matter for the school authority.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	805	The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream and special schools. The NCSE operates within my  Department's policy in allocating this support.  I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	806	My Department has provided funds for over thirty projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas, including the project specifically referred to by the Deputy.  In the context of the budget for 2010 it was decided that funding for these projects was to be reduced from €3,643,000 in 2009 to €2,461,000 in 2010.  Projects within the Dublin City area are administered by the City of Dublin Youth Services Board under the aegis of City of Dublin VEC. Within the overall allocation for the projects in Dublin City, the Board prioritised those projects where frontline staff were employed.  In that context, no allocations were made to a small number of projects, including the project referred to by the Deputy.I would point out that since 1990 my Department has funded an Initiative for Third Level Education in the same locality as the project in question. The interventions under this initiative, both financial and cultural, aim to increase educational aspirations not only in the schools but also in the wider community and to increase the participation rate of pupils from the area in third level education.  My Department also provides significant levels of funding for the area in question through the School Completion Programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	807	As the Deputy may be aware, 30 schools are currently included in the JCSP Demonstration Library project. I am pleased to say that the Librarians in those schools who are currently employed under the terms of Fixed Term Contracts will be retained for a further year.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	808	There has been ongoing engagement and discussion with the relevant education partners, including the INTO, involving my Department concerning general education matters and specific budgetary matters.In relation to the supply teacher scheme a decision was taken in Budget 2010 to cease this scheme from the start of the 2010/11 school year.   It is expected that this measure will save €0.4m in 2010 and €1.1m in a full year. The Deputy will be aware of the need to continue to achieve savings on the public finances so the scope is not there to retain the scheme. The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies.While the supply teacher scheme had benefits for schools it is considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers "on call" all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	809	An appeal has been received by my Department from the person referred to by the Deputy. The appeal is currently under consideration and a response will issue to the candidate as soon as the review process is completed.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-24 00:00:00	Prelude	810	The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.

This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.My Department has received an appeal against the decision of the school to refuse enrolment to this child and the Appeals Committee is scheduled to consider this appeal on Tuesday 29th June 2010. The Secretary General of my Department will subsequently issue the appeal committee's determination to the parents of this child.
