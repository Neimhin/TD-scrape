Pat Finucane was killed in February 1989 by a UDA death squad working in collusion with RUC special branch, the British Army's force reconnaissance unit and the British state. For three decades, like so many others, the family have fought a formidable campaign seeking a public inquiry into Pat's killing. Despite incontrovertible evidence that British state agents were directly involved in authorising and planning the killing, successive British Governments have blushed and stalled to prevent this. An outcome of the Weston Park talks in 2001 was to appoint a judge to make recommendations on the need for public inquiries into a number of conflict-related deaths and, where required, that the relevant Government would implement the recommendation. Judge Peter Cory reported on 1 April 2004 and recommended a public inquiry into the killing of Patrick Finucane. That was more than 16 years ago. In 2012, the then British Prime Minister, David Cameron, acknowledged that there had been, as he put it, shocking levels of collusion in this killing. That was eight years ago. The British Supreme Court ruled in February last year that all previous investigations into the killing of Pat Finucane were incapable of establishing the full facts and failed to meet the standards of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Pat's widow, Geraldine, had to bring a judicial review against the British Secretary of State for his failure to act on this decision. On 11 October last, the barrister acting for the Secretary of State told the court a decision on an inquiry would be taken on or before 30 November. That is next Monday and the family are still waiting. The EU Council of Ministers has expressed its deep concern that a decision still has not been taken by the British Government. That is a concern we all share. Only a public inquiry can assist the family to get the truth. The Finucane family have spoken truth to power for 30 years. They have not been and will not be silenced. Their questions deserve answers and their questions will not go away. The British Government has an obligation to ensure that the truth is told. I have written to the British Prime Minister urging that his Government fulfil Britain's international human rights obligations and hold a public inquiry. I also wrote to the Taoiseach last week and I asked him to engage with Mr. Johnson at this critical juncture. I know the Taoiseach met with the Finucane family yesterday. I know they have thanked him for his support and, in particular, they thanked him for his commitment to engage with Boris Johnson ahead of the 30 November deadline. It is incredibly important that the demand for a public inquiry has the full weight of the office of An Taoiseach behind it. It is also important that there is a unified stance from the whole Oireachtas in support of the Finucane family. It is in that spirit that I ask the Taoiseach when he will make this urgent contact with Mr. Johnson. Will he make it absolutely clear to the British Prime Minister that a full public inquiry must happen as soon as possible because the Finucane family has already waited far too long?

I agree with the Deputy that there must be a full public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane - a husband, a father, a brother and a son. Such a public inquiry, as the Deputy said, was provided for in the agreement reached between the Irish and British Governments at Weston Park in 2001. The Oireachtas is of one mind on this. We have reaffirmed this view many times over the years and we will do so again this week with an agreed motion in Seanad Éireann. This is an important week for the Finucane family. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, has committed to taking a decision on whether to order a public inquiry before the end of November. As the Deputy said, this follows the judicial review of the UK Supreme Court decision in regard to the inadequacy of previous reviews into this murder. Our Government has reaffirmed our position on this issue to the Secretary of State through the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will engage with the British Prime Minister on this issue and making very clear the consistent view of successive Irish Governments that there should, and must, be a full public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane. I also know the leaders of the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Green Party, with Sinn Féin, have jointly communicated their support for a full public inquiry. Yesterday, I sat down with Pat's wife, Geraldine, and her son, John, and I made it very clear to them that they would have the full weight of the Taoiseach's office behind their endeavour. For more than 30 years, Geraldine Finucane and her family have campaigned tirelessly to get to the truth of what happened to Pat. It has been a very long journey and they have conducted it with great dignity and determination. The Irish Government has walked with them on that journey and we will continue to do so until the commitments entered into at Weston Park are honoured. That is our commitment. We note this battle is taking place also in Europe, where, in September, the Council of Europe’s committee of ministers expressed their deep concern that a decision has still not been made by the United Kingdom authorities on how to respond to the UK Supreme Court judgement of 2019. That is the position right now. We will engage with the British Prime Minister. Given the extraordinary perseverance of the Finucane family, in my view, it is now more than timely for the British Government to respond appropriately in establishing a full public inquiry.

From day one, as he knows, the British Government has resisted revealing the truth on the killing of Pat Finucane. In 2012, his wife, Geraldine, said:At every turn, dead witnesses have been blamed and defunct agencies found wanting. Serving personnel and active state departments appear to have been excused. The dirt has been swept under the carpet without any serious attempt to lift the lid on what really happened to Pat and so many others.I am sure that everyone in the Dáil hopes that the British Government will now stop resisting the truth and that Mr. Johnson will announce a full public inquiry because, as I have said and as the Taoiseach has so graciously reiterated, the Finucane family should not have to suffer any longer. They should not have to fight any longer. All the lies, bluffing and stalling have to end. Only the truth will give them peace. I ask the Taoiseach again to do everything he can to ensure they finally have that.

There is a very important aspect to this also. Where sovereign governments enter into agreements, they should be adhered to and followed through. The Irish Government at the time entered into its commitments and it established the Smithwick inquiry, irrespective of where it would land and without fear or favour. The same should apply to the UK Government. In the conduct of international affairs and relationships between two sovereign friendly nations a basic tenet of such relationships should be that if we enter into agreements, they should be honoured. As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, I pursued this at the time and met with quite considerable resistance. If the Deputy recalls, at that time the Bloody Sunday inquiry was coming to a conclusion. That may have been a context for the wider British response. There may be other factors that we all know about that may be hindering the right decision being made but, suffice to say, I believe it is important that the British Government would adhere to commitments given solemnly in respect of an overarching agreement that has worked for the benefit of all the people on this island and enhanced the relationships between the people living on these islands. It is in that spirit that I ask the British Prime Minister and the British Government to do the right thing on this occasion and establish a full public inquiry.

They have certainly created problems for both and potentially brought both into disrepute. There is no doubt that we need to deal with the issue at hand, in particular the appointment to the Supreme Court, but we also need to see the much-needed and long-promised reform of the relationship between the Oireachtas and the Judiciary. There is no doubt but that the Dáil and the public are entitled to know the process by which an appointment was made to the Supreme Court. Regrettably, the Minister for Justice has refused to outline that process to us and to abide by the long-established tradition where a Minister comes into the House and explains his or her actions to ensure accountability to this House. I am saying to the Taoiseach, respectfully, that he needs to ensure that his Minister for Justice abides by that tradition of being accountable to the House. It is a requirement of a Minister and a requirement of the Taoiseach that he ensure that that opportunity is provided to Members of this House. We have to end the charade of the Minister talking about coming in and answering questions under the regular arrangements for oral questions. That just does not wash. It is not acceptable by any standards and the Taoiseach needs to end that charade. We need to have a full explanation as to the criteria or the matrix that were used in identifying why one person was appointed to the Supreme Court as opposed to the other three candidates who had applied. I stress that I am talking about the process, not the merits of one individual over another. We also need an explanation of the reason the Minister did not inform other party leaders within the coalition about the existence of those other candidates.The question which then arises is whether, in the absence of information about potential candidates, the Cabinet was actually capable of exercising collective responsibility under the Constitution. The other issue that we need an explanation in respect of is why there was a 12-month delay in filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court which first arose in June 2019. For all of those reasons, I ask the Taoiseach to respect this House and arrange for the Minister to come in and take questions in the normal manner.

I accept that the overall situation needs to be reformed, which is why the Government will shortly bring forward the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. We will make amendments to the legislation that was piloted through the House by the former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross. At the time, I believed that the balance in the context of that legislation was wrong. The Government is of the opinion that the Chief Justice should chair such a commission for judicial appointments. The new legislation will be brought before the House as soon as it is ready. I accept the need for broader reform in the context of judicial appointments. The Constitution is clear about the manner in which judges are appointed and the Cabinet taking decisions in that regard. The name of Mr. Justice Woulfe was brought before the Cabinet and the Cabinet decided to appoint him to the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution and the law.

It is beneath him to be doing that. I have appealed to the Taoiseach. He has a responsibility to Members of this House to ensure that the Minister is accountable to the House. I ask the Taoiseach to provide that opportunity for accountability. The Minister for Justice has refused to make herself amenable to accountability. The Ceann Comhairle, in upholding the rights of Members of this House, has been clear in setting out the requirements for accountability. I ask the Taoiseach to respect that, to respect this House and to insist that the Minister for Justice come here to make a statement and subject herself to questions and answers. We are entitled to that. It is nothing less than what we are entitled to. If the Taoiseach continues to refuse to allow that accountability, he will continue to damage the relationship between and reputation of the House and the Judiciary. I ask the Taoiseach to accede to the requests from all parties for the Minister to do her duty and for him to do his in order to ensure that this House operates properly.

On 6 November at a meeting with the Taoiseach, he will recall that I questioned Dr. Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer, on his presentation as to why the rate of decline of Covid-19 infection in Dublin had stalled. While I did not get an answer I specifically stated that we needed to have a further meeting to go into those figures. That did not happen. However, the rate of infection in Dublin continued to stagnate and we now see the same situation being replicated across our country. Yesterday morning Microsoft announced that it is to create 200 software engineering jobs to support, among other things, cloud services for its global customers. The HSE is one of those customers using its Microsoft dynamics CRM, customer relationship management package. This is a system designed to help companies manage and maintain customer relationships and deliver actionable data. As we speak we have over 500 people working in 11 contact tracing centres inputting large volumes of data every minute on to this system. This data has the capacity to generate reports on who, where and how people are getting infected with Covid-19. This is information that the Government urgently needs to make the right decisions on how we exit from the current lockdown, allow people to live again, allow businesses to open up and, more importantly, ensure that we do not face a further lockdown. To do that we need to know what this virus is doing in Ireland’s population, which is both geographically and culturally very different to other EU countries. The Government will make decisions this week on an educated guess, on anecdotal evidence, on partial data but sadly, not with all of the hard, cold facts. It is akin to making up a flatpack kitchen but refusing to look at the instructions. While a bit of putty will cover over any mistakes in making up a kitchen, if this Government and its unaccountable advisers get this wrong, then our children and their children will be paying for it. Who is interrogating this Microsoft dynamics CRM to generate the data on what is actually happening with Covid-19 in Ireland to provide the evidence for the policy decisions that the Taoiseach’s Government will make later this week?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	41	My first point is that we should stand back from creating unnecessary rows and tensions between public health advice, Government decisions and the views of the Oireachtas. I accept that people have different perspectives on Covid-19 and the steps we must take to keep the virus down, open up society and relax restrictions.We should never question the good faith of people on all sides, particularly in the public health realm and NPHET, whose fundamental objective is to protect lives and public health. We should not lose sight of that in the debate. Second, the Deputy is correct in saying data are very important. We have done extra work in the past while in assessing data and doing work on them — it is essentially data analytics — within my Department and in conjunction with NPHET and others. The data will inform the next steps. That is an important point to make; it is not guesswork. Some of the steps may not be palatable while some will be. I said at the outset, when going into level 5, that we wanted to come out in or around level 3. I can see that we are all fatigued by Covid but the bottom line is that Ireland is second best in Europe in dealing with the second wave. One would hardly realise that with the tension about the place, the attacks, criticism and giving out. I repeat that our performance is the second best in the European Union in terms of keeping the virus down. Will someone acknowledge that? I believe it needs to be acknowledged. Our figures are low because of a series of restrictions and the hard work of the Irish people. The Irish people have adhered to these restrictions, to be fair to them.

I accept that. It is a big cost but the Irish people are adhering and it is working. We would like the figures to be lower. I would prefer them to be lower again. They are still coming down. Last evening, the 14-day incidence per 100,000 was 108.7. Finland is ahead of us, with about 50 per 100,000. Other European countries are in a much more difficult space. The big challenge for us as decision-makers in the Oireachtas is that what we do will pose risks as we move into December. There will be risks as we move into the Christmas period. How we mitigate those risks will be the key challenge facing us. Fundamentally, our job is to represent all the people of the country and to protect them and their livelihoods. There is an enormous economic cost to the restrictions, particularly in travel, tourism, hospitality, food and accommodation. This is where I sense the biggest impact has been. One should remember these level 5 restrictions have taken place in the context of the schools being reopened and staying open, which has been a tremendous boost to the parents of the children. Many of them have to go to work but would not be able to do so if schools were not open to the children in all the school communities. We have kept health services open alongside the Covid services, which was not the case in the first lockdown. Construction has kept going in terms of constructing badly needed houses and infrastructure. Manufacturing has continued.

The Taoiseach should not allow himself to be fobbed him off and told the output from the CRM system is being used because it is not. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre is using data from a laboratory reporting system that was never designed for this pandemic. Hospital-based occupational health doctors and some public health doctors investigating outbreaks do not use the CRM so many other health-related outbreaks are not entered on it. We are still seeing a huge number of cases associated with hospitals and care homes, involving both patients and staff. From my investigations, I have learned Covid is spreading in these settings and spilling over from staff into communities. I understand that 12 hospitals currently have restrictions on elective procedures because of Covid outbreaks. If we were to use the data we have, it would allow the Taoiseach to tell the people with authority what they need to do to control this virus.

I do not disagree with him on the utilisation of data to inform decision-making. That is important. Various sets of data can inform decisions. The Deputy is correct in saying there have been outbreaks in certain healthcare settings, which has been problematic for those settings in dealing with the normal throughput, services and so forth. To inform our decisions, our approach is based on analysing data.Without question, I believe I am safe in saying that, after level 3, the decision to restrict visits to households was a key decision that impacted on reducing numbers, even prior to level 5 coming in. The spread within households has been significant overall in terms of the spread of the virus. I said yesterday - we can apply this to both households and other locations - that where we have gatherings associated with events and alcohol, we do get a spike. The data show that in certain areas and certain contexts fairly unequivocally. Deputy Naughten is correct in his broader point in terms of using data as best we can. The higher we go in restrictions, the blunter an instrument they represent. Fundamentally, public health officials want congregation down as low as possible. That is up to us. People have been very good in adhering to this for six weeks. We are going to have to maintain our vigilance on this. The fact that vaccines are on the horizon should be a reason for doubling down now on best behaviour and ensuring we keep the virus as low as possible until we have more widespread use of the vaccine in the population.

If the intention is to open businesses for Christmas, why all the secrecy? If people are having a turkey for Christmas dinner, they will already be making plans for this. People make plans one month or five weeks in advance because they have to order the turkey or whatever food they will have for Christmas. Why? It is because of supply and demand. Are there any considerations for the looming issue regarding the supply chain of food for hotels, pubs and restaurants for Christmas? Hotels, pubs and restaurants have not ordered food or drink from their suppliers for months. They still do not know whether they are opening. They cannot simply turn a switch and say they are opening tomorrow and expect all the suppliers to have stock for them. In preparation for the proposed opening up of the economy, hotels have contacted their suppliers. Suppliers have told the hotels they are unsure about the reopening and cannot judge the stock. They cannot guarantee supply. The knock-on effect is that there is no guarantee of supply. Children all over the world send their letters to Santa Claus in advance. Why? It gives Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus and the elves due time so they can have the presents for the children on Christmas Day. Even the children around the world know this. Christmas is the busiest time of the year. People start planning to come home for Christmas up to 12 months in advance. We know that Christmas is different. What the Government has done to date has not worked. People will meet officially or unofficially. If the hotels, pubs and restaurants are open, we will have traceability and accountability. The Government should work with what it has. There are 14,000 gardaí in Ireland, plus trainees. If the Government worked out the timetable, it would find out that at any one time we have a maximum of 6,000 gardaí on duty. That is approximately a ratio of people per garda of 900:1. If we work out the figures for hotels, pubs and restaurants, we quadruple traceability and accountability. We can work out the people who will not go to hotels and those who will not go to restaurants. It works out at between one and ten per person. We can then work out that we have 6,000 gardaí to go to where the problem lies at the moment, that is, where people are meeting for house parties. As the Taoiseach just mentioned, this is where the spike happens. The Government does not have the right number of people to quarantine what is in this country. The Taoiseach should use his head, common sense and a business approach and use what we have.

I made it very clear five weeks ago that there would be a six-week application of level 5. I made it very clear in the first press conference that our objective was to arrive back at level 3 and see what we could do around that, depending on where the numbers were. My focus has been to get the numbers down. That is Government's and society's focus and, as soon as one starts talking about relaxation two or three weeks out, that focus goes out the window. It is important we get the numbers down of a virus that is deadly, kills people, injures people long term and can do real damage. Sometimes in the debate, I feel that is getting lost. If I have to say it straight, I feel that key aspect of Covid is lost because of fatigue and the fact it is going on so long. That has to be our first motivation. In terms of protection of livelihoods, if the virus gets to unmanageable levels, the economic damage will be far worse long term, as a consequential lockdown of a longer duration would be required. Ireland moved earlier than most European countries and is the better for having moved earlier with severe restrictions, while keeping aspects of our economy and social life open, in particular, schools. It has been a tough sacrifice for people. I said earlier that the hospitality sector has borne the brunt of this because, in hospitality and tourism, people gather. Where people gather, the virus thrives, unfortunately. The Government has brought in unprecedented supports for sectors of the economy through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the new Covid restriction support scheme, CRSS, for those who have been closed long term or had very low turnover long term. The numbers are extraordinary by any yardstick, in terms of the scale of that intervention. We understand the difficulties people are going through because of Covid-19. It has had a damaging impact on people's lives and livelihoods and different sectors of the economy. The Deputy said what is happening has not worked. It has worked. We were at 1,200 cases per day and that has come way down. I want to get that lower and that is our challenge. The challenge for December and beyond will be making sure that through our individual and collective behaviour we do not do things that cause the virus to rise again. It can rise quickly, as we know. That impacts on hospitalisations, on people's health and, ultimately, on the economy.

All these hotels are waiting for the lockdown to lift, in the hope of salvaging Christmas. I spoke at length to the manager of Adare Manor, where 600 people are employed, who told me what the Taoiseach talked about earlier on, if he mentioned the hotels were opening. The Taoiseach had a channel to get to the hotels, restaurants and businesses and tell them that if the level 5 restrictions hold the numbers to a certain level, they would then be allowed to open. Then the hotels could gauge it themselves and prepare going forward. However, everything is a secret and the Government expects it can turn a switch and everything will be rosy and things will happen straight away. The Taoiseach had the mechanism within his Department to go to dialogue and give the information to the hoteliers and businesses and tell them if we reach certain numbers, we will go to level 3; if we reach different numbers, we will go to level 4. Then they could prepare for it. That is called giving people personal responsibility. Empower the people. People are not fools in Ireland. They want to keep themselves safe and the Taoiseach can then use what force is necessary for the minority who will not do it.

People have tracked the status of the virus over the last number of weeks in terms of numbers coming down. When we reopened after the first lockdown - go right through the summer into September and October - restrictions were lifted and certain things happened, notwithstanding all the dialogue in the world. All of the Deputies know this in terms of certain locations, certain events. It is not a secret how spikes happened in certain locations and how the virus went up. There is no secrecy here. I made it very clear at the beginning that we were going to level 5 and would try to exit at level 3. We will be giving the sectors proper notice in advance of an easing of the restrictions and an exiting from level 5.

There are serious and pressing questions that need to be put to the Minister for Justice and clarified on the floor of the Dáil. The Taoiseach's overarching objective in the midst of all of this has been to evade, spoof and deny that accountability to the Dáil. The fact that the Minister will not make herself available to make a statement and take questions is shocking and unacceptable, but what is much worse is that the Taoiseach would facilitate that behaviour. The elected representatives here have not only a right, but a duty to put the necessary questions to the Minister. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Taoiseach is continuing to block this legitimate parliamentary work. He should recall that, as recently as 2017, he led the charge for accountability. He was right to do so, but he is wrong now and failing in his duty as Taoiseach by preventing the necessary accountability-----

Let me call a spade a spade. The Taoiseach is creating the most dangerous precedent in the House that I have seen since becoming a Deputy. No Minister will be accountable to the Dáil if this is what the Taoiseach allows to happen. Who will be the next Minister with questions to answer and who is struggling on something? He or she will not want to appear before the Dáil and will not do so because the Taoiseach of the day decided that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, should not appear before it. As I stated last week, all of the arguments that the Taoiseach has put forward are bogus. This will get sorted out one way or the other. We will get to the truth. There will be bigger issues for the Taoiseach than the Minister for Justice when we do. The Taoiseach has one chance left. He can grin and smile away-----

If the Taoiseach was sitting on the opposite side of the House, he would insist on that. It seems that he is going to be a part of the charade being followed by the Minister for Justice in terms of making out that it is in any way acceptable that she comes in here under the normal parliamentary questions rota. The Taoiseach knows in his heart that is wrong and he would not accept that if he was on the Opposition benches. A basic tenet of our parliamentary democracy is that there is accountability by Government to the House. The Taoiseach is denying us that accountability by protecting the Minister, Deputy McEntee. It is wrong and he is setting a very dangerous precedent.

What is happening is an abuse by the Government of the majority it has. It is an abuse to hide behind the idea of separation of powers and that we cannot possibly answer questions about this to avoid accountability to the Dáil. That is what is happening repeatedly on Leaders' Questions. I watched all of them last week. Very simple questions have been asked and people have refused to answer them. The Minister for Justice, who is responsible, has refused to answer questions and is being shielded by the Government from coming in here and answering questions. Instead, we have the absolute insult of a suggestion that accountability is achieved by doing regular oral parliamentary questions, where questions are submitted in advance, answers are prepared and so on. It is absolutely scandalous.

Questions are now being asked in public about why the second position was not filled, given the multiple candidates who applied for the job. Is it the case that the second position is also part of the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party coalition deal?

We have no interest in an impeachment process and we made that quite clear. There are no grounds for impeachment. However, we want the Minister for Justice to come to the House. Her predecessor should also come before the House because he slipped her the note. This is horse trading at its worst. I asked the Taoiseach at the leaders' meeting if he was aware that the name was coming before the Cabinet and he never answered me. A murky deal has been done. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land and we all have to engage in due process. Anybody who is on a board of management understands processes and how people have to absent themselves if they have connections.  To his credit, the former Minister, Shane Ross, stopped the Government from making the appointment for ten months. When the letters started moving two days before the election between the Chief Justice and the then Minister, Deputy Flanagan, that was the start. The Government thought the then Minister, Shane Ross, would be gone within a couple of days. He lost his seat but there was a caretaker Government and he stopped that being done. It is blackguarding of the people.  There is talk of the separation of powers between the Judiciary and the House politically. Damage is being done every day by the prevarication here. We want the Minister for Justice to come before the House to answer questions. We often allow a rota swap between Ministers. We will not do that now because the Taoiseach is blackguarding the House.

The Taoiseach spoke of the separation of powers being precious in our democracy. I want him to reflect on the fact that we are talking about the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, the court whose judges interpret the people's Constitution and protect the people by assessing legislation and dealing with cases. It does not get more important than that. Therefore, the process of appointment to that court could not be any more important to our democracy. We know that at least three judges, we assume of the High Court or Court of Appeal, eminently qualified people, expressed an interest in sitting in the highest court in the land. The Taoiseach referred to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which assesses if somebody is qualified to be considered.There can be a shortlist of seven at the most but the board does not make the decision or the recommendation.

We will be bringing it up again at the Business Committee on Thursday, should the committee be allowed to meet. W are not having requests granted for Business Committee meetings, which is another problem emanating from this. This is spiralling. I ask the Taoiseach to take control of the matter so that we can deal with it once and for all.

It is no less than he has required of several Ministers in the past when he was sitting on the other side of the House. I ask the Taoiseach to be reasonable. He is running the risk of doing serious damage to procedures here if he does not allow this. He is running the risk of allowing a situation whereby a Minister can shirk responsibility for anything in future simply by answering a question under the normal oral questions. The Taoiseach knows in his heart that this is wrong. It also means that several Members of the House will not have an opportunity to ask the Minister questions.

That format has presented problems for the Government. It has clearly created situations of embarrassment and pressure for the Government and for particular Ministers. The Government has decided this is the issue in respect of which to draw a line in the sand and establish a norm whereby Ministers are no longer accountable in that fashion. In the past few minutes, the Minister for Justice has stated-----

In the past few minutes the Minister for Justice has said there is no issue with her answering questions. She said she offered to change priority questions and every party said "No", and she said the suggestion is that priority questions cannot be used to hold Ministers to account. It is, again, an insult when very single Opposition party and grouping is saying we want accountability in the form of the Minister coming in to answer questions, with ten or 15 minutes per party, back and forth.

Cúpla bliain ó shin, in 2017, the Taoiseach was on the Opposition side remonstrating about the appointment of an excellent Attorney General, Máire Whelan. He was not very kind in the words he said or the comparisons he made. The real problem here is not, as I have said, anything to do with impeachment, it is the appointment process. The former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, blocked it for eight months. That is common knowledge. This is more about the Taoiseach's weakened position. He is the most feeble and inept Taoiseach I have ever met. He is beholden to Fine Gael for this job and that job. Fine Gael got this job and they pulled the wool over the Taoiseach's eyes. They are pulling it every day and they will keep pulling it while he lets them. By the way, commiserations for Sunday.

It is very interesting and telling the difference that moving across to the other side of the House has made in this case. If the Taoiseach was on this side, he would be calling for the Minister to come to the House but because he is over there he is blocking it. That is the reality of the situation.

The reality of the situation is that, under the stewardship of the Taoiseach, a number of Ministers have come into this Chamber in similar circumstances, and questions have been taken, they have made a statement and everyone in the Chamber has had the opportunity to cross-examine them on various issues. All we want is exactly the same for the Minister for Justice. The Minister for Justice should be no more precious than the Tánaiste or anyone else in this Chamber. She should come in here and answer the questions that need to be answered. The truth is the Taoiseach is hiding something and the longer this goes on, the more the public see that. The way to deal with this is to bring the Minister in here, as has been asked for, not for scripted questions and scripted answers, but for proper questions and answers to be taken in this Chamber by everybody, and to do this before the end of the week. I appeal to the Taoiseach. At the end of the day, it is his head that is on the line. People can see that he is the one who is responsible. She is his Minister. He needs to bring her in here and make this happen as quickly as possible.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	185	This is spiralling. This is going to go on every week. We are going through this every week until the Minister comes in. The Taoiseach seems to be under some misapprehension that this will just float away. This is going nowhere. Everybody now has concerns in regard to what happened here. We need to know what happened here. This will not just disappear. Members will ask parliamentary questions and we will get specific answers because the Government will have no choice but to give them since we will make sure they are in order. As this information drips and drips, with the help, dare I say it, of the media, I can tell the Taoiseach the issue for him will not be Deputy Helen McEntee, the issue will be the future of his Government. He is the one who is covering this and ensuring we do not get accountability. This now is about him. Make the decision now. If the Taoiseach does not allow her to come in here, this will now be about him as much as about the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and about his decision-making in not allowing her to come in.

What she is engaged in is a twisting of the truth and, today, the Taoiseach is doing exactly the same. He is twisting the truth. He knows perfectly well that the request is not for her to come in and do the normal oral questions. He knows exactly what we are talking about. What we are asking for is exactly the same as he has asked of other Ministers and has been granted in the past. The question now is what the Taoiseach is afraid of and why he will not uphold the rights of Members of this House.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	187	For two weeks now, with the amount of public attention given to this and the amount of time given to this in the House, one could reasonably ask why the Taoiseach does not just agree. If she has nothing to hide, why does the Minister not just come in here and answer questions? The only conclusion one can draw, as Deputy Shortall pointed out, is that there is something to hide, and that there is a problem with the answers we would get in that context. The very generous offer to come in and do oral parliamentary questions, as every Minister has to do every couple of months in any case is very cynical on the part of the Government. The Government is abusing the fact that the average person in the street does not know the difference between different types of questions. If that was okay, why, three years ago, did the Taoiseach not just ask his questions of the Minister for Justice on oral parliamentary questions?

Deputy McDonald very deliberately used some of his own words from three years ago last week to suggest that he could be on this side of the House issuing exactly the same speech in question. He knew at that point in time that what he is offering now was not acceptable because it does not amount to accountability.

That will be the impression with regard to his Government if he continues to stonewall on the opportunity for the Opposition to ask questions. The Taoiseach actually has an opportunity to change the culture of Leinster House. He has an opportunity now to create a culture of transparency and openness whereby all Ministers have a responsibility to answer questions, even the question I put to him at the start of this, namely, why the second vacancy was not filled and whether that also part of the coalition deal. That also was not answered. We would have an opportunity to ask that question of the Minister.

When you are in a hole and when you are digging, the best thing to do at some stage is to stop. The Taoiseach knows in his heart and soul this is not going to be given up. The leaders of the different groups are not going to give up.This will be relentless and there is no harm in that if there is nothing to hide. Why should the Minister not come into the House and answer basic questions from Members who are elected to represent everybody? They just want answers. That is all there is to it. Why not, please, relent and stop the adversarial action the Taoiseach and his Government seem to be taking because in the end he will not win. She will have to come into the House and answer questions in a proper way. That is only right and proper and the Taoiseach may as well do it now rather than fight and do it next week or in two or three weeks. The sooner he does it, the better for him, the Government and the country.

It is obvious that it has to happen. If the Taoiseach were on this side of the House, he would be doing the exact same. If Deputy Leo Varadkar was the Taoiseach he would be saying "No, no" but Deputy Martin would be saying "Yes, yes". It is going to happen so the Taoiseach should just make it so.

Wind energy has to have a place in the future of Ireland's renewable energy sector. We need to put in place sensible regulations to facilitate its development. Across the midlands, particularly in Laois and Offaly, wind farms have sprung up and been constructed without any regulations or even up to date guidelines. We are working on out of date 2007 guidelines. In both Laois and Offaly, massive turbines have been erected and they are close to dwelling houses in some cases. This has been of particular interest to me and Sinn Féin for many years. I first introduced the Bill in the Thirty-first Dáil in 2014 to provide regulations for wind turbine developments. I followed up on that with legislation in 2016. Today is my third attempt in seven years to make progress on this important issue. I will keep trying. Sinn Féin's Bill seeks to introduce practical regulations that can be implemented to allow wind farms to be constructed and to be located in the correct places. It also deals with what we should do with excess product and establishes opportunities for community involvement through public consultation in the planning phase and also in part ownership, which is important. There is a good example of this in Templederry in Tipperary. Our Bill attempts to introduce some common sense to setback distances and to deal with that contentious debate. We propose a minimum setback distance of ten times the height of the turbine, to the tip of the blade. We propose that noise levels should be kept within World Health Organization limits. Shadow flicker from the propeller should not be permitted to pass over a dwelling house. Crucially, the Bill gives power back to local authorities and councillors which was taken away from them when the critical infrastructure legislation was brought through this House in the 2000s. It removed the power of councillors, the people elected at local level, to decide on these matters. This is important with regard to wind farms. We need to involve local communities in the development of renewable energy and in wind turbine development to avoid the conflict and resistance from areas that are impacted. In line with the best practice across Europe, our Bill provides local communities in a 4 km radius the opportunity to buy shares in projects and to receive shares as a dividend. This could provide great financial assistance for disadvantaged rural areas and help to regenerate rural areas that have been marginalised and disadvantaged over the past few decades. It is unfortunate that three consecutive Governments have failed to put in place wind farm regulations. I have pursued this since the Thirty-first Dáil, in 2014, because I believe that some simple, common sense changes can be made to help local communities and to support the sector to develop properly in a sustainable way. The Bill is straightforward. I sincerely ask people in all parties to read it. There is a feeling that this has been put on the back burner the whole time, while wind farms have been springing up. In other words, the horse has been allowed to bolt and then the gate has been fastened. That is not the way. We should have learned from the housing crisis and the shambolic developments of the Celtic tiger era. We should not let the same thing happen with wind farms. I ask all parties to read this Bill and hopefully Members of this House can find it within themselves to back this moderate, sensible legislation.

The Covid-19 crisis has served as a rare opportunity to reflect and re-evaluate what really matters. The pandemic has proven that we have, for far too long, put far too much emphasis on a set of narrow economic metrics at the expense of the well-being of our people, the quality of our lived environment and the strength of our social capital. This must now change. With favourable international borrowing conditions, now is the time to be ambitious for our country and deliver a new social contract, as the Labour Party has been calling for for some time. With such funds available as we saw in budget 2021, delivering on our cherished dream of a fair and equal Ireland is, for the first time in our history, within our grasp. This once in a generation opportunity should not be squandered and our resources must be spent to maximise the well-being of all our people. The measures in this Bill will help us to do just that. This Bill is not about abandoning the traditional economic indicators of GDP or the new hybrid model, GNI*. However, we must recognise the fundamental shortcomings of these measures if used in isolation as has been the case so far. For example, if a factory creates pollution but contributes to economic growth, it is measured as a good thing. If one spends money fixing the pollution caused by the factory, that is further economic growth, which is measured as a good thing. However, in reality, we all know that is bizarre. The economist Simon Kuznets created the concept of GDP in 1934 when he developed it as a tool to measure economic growth. At the time, he wrote to the US Congress, stating, "The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income". He also said:Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between its costs and return, and between the short and the long term. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what.Those are the questions we must ask. What do we want to grow and what do we really value? Since 2016, we have had a Government which placed economic growth above all else. Economic growth was an end in itself. In the Government's eyes, the economy may have been working, but it was certainly not working for ordinary people. Far too many felt left behind, without hope and simply running to a standstill. They could not afford decent housing, healthcare or childcare. We have to start measuring these issues because they are just as important as any economic growth statistic and a vital part of the social contract between the State and its citizens. This Bill seeks to address two deficiencies in our national statistics. The first relates to our lack of genuine progress indicators and the second is the lack of national distributional accounts, a set of accounts which measures the distribution of economic growth between different income earners both before and, importantly, after tax.Specifically, it will confer functions on the Central Statistics Office and on the National Economic and Social Council as to the publication of indices to be known as a genuine progress indicators. This will empower both organisations to take a fuller account of the quality of life and well-being of the community by incorporating environmental, social and other economic factors that are not otherwise measured. In addition, the publication of national distributional accounts under this proposed legislation will ensure that both income and wealth inequality are reported upon so as to close the gap between the have-littles and the have-lots. As we approach a century since founding the State, this important Bill will allow us to chart a new course for our country, create new social contract for all of our citizens and ensure that we finally cherish all of the children of the nation equally. If we are to learn the lessons of this pandemic and shape the future in a meaningful way, then we will need new quality-of-life measures as outlined in this Bill. It is clear as a society that we manage what we measure and now we must begin to measure what really matters. I heartily recommend this Bill to the House and I hope other Members will give it their support when we have the opportunity to debate it on Second Stage.

Three years ago, this month, "RTÉ Investigates" broadcast "Nightmare to Let", which was a damning indictment of some of the worst standards in the private rental sector that many of us have seen for decades. It showed large numbers of people living in cramped, insanitary and, at times, seriously dangerous conditions in rental properties in Dublin and elsewhere. While the progammme highlighted the most extreme breaches of minimum standards in the private rental sector, it genuinely shocked many of us. Later that month, Sinn Féin tabled a Private Members’ motion on the issue of standards within the private rental sector and while it was not supported on the night by Fine Gael, all other Deputies involved in the debate, including those of Fianna Fáil, supported it. The motion called for a number of very simple and sensible measures. The first was for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to set out a plan as a matter of urgency to ensure full compliance with minimum standards in the private rental sector. It also called for a more comprehensive inspection regime of all properties within the private rental sector and specifically for the introduction of an NCT-style certification as advocated by Threshold and others to ensure compliance. The motion also urged Government to examine the penalties for those landlords, small in number but who nonetheless breach these standards, and for an annual report on progress to date. While the then Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, allocated additional funding for the inspections to the private rental sector, which I welcomed, it was nowhere near enough to get us to the level of inspections that are required, and the most recent figures that we have are for 2018 from the National Oversight and Audit Commission, showed that just 7% of private rental properties were inspected that year. Some of our larger local authorities in cities where the majority of private renters live did not even meet that. Cork city only had 4% in that year and in Dublin city where there is the largest concentration of private renters it was just 5%. My own local authority of South Dublin County Council, which has a slightly better record than others, still only managed 11%. The central problem is that the local authorities do not have the funding or the staff to conduct the level of inspections that are required.  It is often said that the overwhelming majority of are fully compliant with the regulations and I would genuinely like to believe that but the problem is that we do not know because the overwhelming majority properties are not inspected. The fact that it is only a minority of properties that are reported to the Residential Tenancies Board, which clearly indicates that very large numbers of landlords are complying with the standards but we need to do much better.  What this Bill does is very straightforward in that it empowers the Minister by way of regulations to introduce an NCT-style certification accompanied by a charge for this and to roll that out as a matter of urgency. Sinn Féin would like 25% of all private rental properties to be inspected once a year, which is is a very basic proposition. Every fifth year a landlord would have to get certification. That certification like the building energy rating, BER, certificate would be displayed within the property and would mean that when prospective tenants went to view a property they intend to rent, they could see if it is compliant with those standards. This could be done for possibly €100 per certification, which is not an onerous charge once every five years for a landlord. It could be phased in over four years so that four years after the enactment of the regulations, all properties would be inspected and would either have a certification or a compliance requirement to meet those standards.  This is not only a protection for renters but also for good landlords because good landlords who do their job, meet this standard and are fully tax compliant are continually undermined by those landlords who break the rules and break the law. Good landlords, therefore, would benefit from this and from better enforcement. Deputies on all sides of the House deal regularly with tenants, including very vulnerable tenants who are in properties that may not be as bad as the properties that we saw in “Nightmare to Let” but still have significant problems with landlords not doing repairs, or not adequately responding to requests for maintenance. Sometimes those landlords themselves do not have the money and are not fully aware of their legal responsibilities but, in many cases, the landlords are simply refusing to do the work that they are legally required to do.  It is simply not acceptable, particularly given that a third of all tenancies in the State are subsidised by Government through housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, rent supplement and long-term leasing. It is simply unacceptable that properties are not regularly inspected. We urge Members to support this Bill on Second Stage. Let us ensure that all landlords are compliant, that all tenants get the standards that they deserve and that we do this in a way that makes the private rental sector better for everybody.

I am pleased to report that the commission has been established by Government and is now fully up and running. It has met on two occasions and will continue to meet on a regular basis the coming months. I provided a pre-recorded video message to mark the commission's inaugural meeting on 29 October.The commission has been constituted as an independent expert body, and its members have been appointed by the Government on the basis of their expertise in broadcast, print and online media. The collective expertise of the commission spans areas as diverse as public service media, independent journalism, social media, new technology platforms, media economics, culture, language, creative content, governance and international best practice. It is envisaged that, over the coming months, the commission will engage comprehensively with stakeholders, including broadcasters, journalists and their representatives, publishers, regional media and the wider public. The secretariat to the commission has been provided by officials from the Department of the Taoiseach in conjunction with officials from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. I very much look forward to receiving the report and recommendations of the commission in due course.

The Taoiseach went some way towards addressing that issue with the appointment of Ms Siobhán Holliman, who essentially wears two hats. She is the deputy editor of the Tuam Herald but also an activist of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ. The Taoiseach said at the inaugural meeting that it is important that we examine how the media can be funded. Does he have any suggestions in that regard? I draw his attention to a policy that emanated in 2018 from the then Fianna Fáil communications spokesperson, Senator Dooley. He proposed a €30 million fund for print journalism, the ring-fencing of VAT and a 6% levy on all digital advertising. Is it the Taoiseach's intention to implement this proposal? Has the Taoiseach a view on the review and reform of our defamation laws? Is there a timeline for a review? Does the Taoiseach believe juries should be removed from defamation cases?

Why is the Government insisting on pushing ahead with plans for a new stealth tax on every household with this talk of a broadcasting charge? Did the Taoiseach not learn any lessons from his experience of the water charges? For years, he has been pushing for a broadcasting charge. Last year, he went so far as to say that if we were Taoiseach, he would introduce it in his first year. Now we have a commission on the future of the media and part of its purpose is clearly to give cover for such a tax. The reality is that the current TV licence is a very unfair, regressive, flat tax. It may be loose change for someone on the Taoiseach's salary but it is a lot of money for a low-earning family. With Covid, many people are struggling to pay the charge but, instead of a bit of understanding, it was announced that TV licence inspectors are still calling to people's homes in the middle of a level 5 lockdown. One cannot have any family over unless they happen to be a television licence inspector. How can the Taoiseach justify that? Rather than charging the fee or imposing a new broadcasting charge on ordinary families, should we not be levying a charge on the massive digital media companies, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, and using the funds to invest in quality media and broadcasting?

If we are to safeguard the future of public service broadcasting and the media, we should, rather than imposing broadcasting charges on ordinary people who are already paying through the nose for Sky, Netflix and God knows what and then imposing another charge on them, impose a digital tax on the profits of the companies. It is outrageous that important national matches, certain GAA matches and so on can be viewed only on some of the private, pay-per-view platforms. It should not be allowed. Similarly, we also need to ensure the public service broadcasters give more time to domestic musical and cultural output. Indeed, a set percentage of their output should be committed to this.

This observation is to miss the point of the concerns raised about the breadth of the commission's membership in terms of addressing the limitations of the goals set for its work. There is no reference in the terms of reference to the consideration of declining employment prospects, media plurality or media ownership. Their inclusion is crucial if the stated purpose of the establishment of the commission is to be realised. Precarious contracts have become the norm for a significant number of workers within print and broadcast media, both public and private. The economic shock of Covid-19 will be felt for some time and will exacerbate this reality. Local media, as has been said, have taken a battering over recent months. It is with these newspapers and radio stations that young journalists have traditionally cut their teeth. Employment rights, career opportunities and the ability to progress are the foundations of the professions' and sector's sustainability and credibility. How will these be factored into the commission's work? The latest Media Pluralism Monitor from the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom highlights common challenges across the European Union. Just over half the member states, including Ireland, score a medium risk under market plurality. This, of course, is not a new concern. How will that be addressed?

Lenin — it was not John Lennon — once said there is freedom of the press in capitalist society for those who own one. I want to ask the Taoiseach about the high concentration of media ownership in this State. The Media Pluralism Monitor states it puts this State at high risk. Reporters without Borders said last year it was the single largest threat to press freedom in this country. It is not talking in the abstract; it is talking about circumstances like those in which Denis O'Brien and Communicorp control Newstalk and Today FM, or 52% of the Dublin market, and 29.9% of shares in Independent News and Media, which owns the Irish Independent, the Sunday Independent, the Evening Herald and the Sunday World. Rupert Murdoch and News Corp own and control The Sunday Times, The Irish Sun, five radio stations etc. What is the media commission going to do to tackle this problem? I favour the ending of the for-profit element in media ownership. Media should be collectively owned and democratically controlled and reflect the diversity of viewpoints in society. There is a debate as to the best way to tackle this. What timescale has the commission, particularly given that there are vacancies in it?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	276	We did respond to the points Deputy Nash raised in the House regarding trade union involvement, but also regional media involvement. That occurred in the context of the additional appointments. We respond to points raised from time to time. As the Deputy said, the appointment of Ms Siobhán Holliman — the deputy editor of the Tuam Herald, member of the Press Council and joint cathaoirleach of the Irish executive council of the NUJ — goes some way towards addressing those issues. On the observations of those on the far left, decisions have got to be made on this at some stage, rather than saying the commission is a cover for the introduction of a charge or whatever. We need independent public service media, and the commission has a role in that in terms of analysing RTÉ and TG4.How does one ensure arms-length independent public service media? That is an important consideration. Deputy Murphy is right. I have in the past advocated the replacement of the RTÉ licence fee with a universal charge that would cover everyone because of the emergence of new technologies and so on. The capacity to sustain independent public service media is at risk. I say that without fear or favour. I do not necessarily benefit from any good coverage one way or the other in some respects. That is not the issue. The issue is how we develop media in Ireland that are independent and how we develop a funding model that is sustainable. I have no wish to prejudice what the commission may come to, but private sector media in Ireland are under pressure and regional media are under pressure. How do we deal with the social media platforms? There was a media commission on ownership and plurality some years back. It identified the growth of social media as a new platform for media and as something that was disruptive in the classic sense of "disruptive". That really created a new plurality, some of which was good and some not-so-good. Hence, in terms of what was not-so-good, the need for strong, robust, independent public service media and independent media as well. The challenge is how we create a sustainable funding model for private sector media as well that could give greater independence in terms of employability. The sector will require a proper funding model in terms of sustainable employment and good quality employment in journalism. What is going on at the moment is not satisfactory. It must be a difficult career choice for young people going into journalism. It is difficult and challenging. It is never-ending. It involves multitasking and all of that. I suggest strongly to the House that the funding model as it currently stands is not sustainable. When the commission comes back with recommendations, the real challenge for us is whether we can put our ideology to one side, bite the bullet and make decisions? I am prepared to make decisions, even if they are unpopular. I get the sense that others want to look at whatever might come as a basis for another campaign. Deputy Paul Murphy is great for campaigns but they do not achieve a great deal other than stymie decision-making.

We can campaign all we like. I believe our national broadcaster needs sustainability and support. It needs reform and it needs to change. Fundamentally, given what has happened in other countries and states, we need to be mindful and careful of the degree to which democracy can be undermined by a plethora of platforms that seek to distort the truth and do not give the citizens of our democracy good, objective material.

I am making a general point in answering. I was asked questions on the idea of the universal charge. It has been around for a long time. It is not a new concept.

Anyway, it is up to the commission to decide. I do not understand-----

The parliamentary liaison unit assists Government in its relationship with the Oireachtas. It works with the Office of the Government Chief Whip on issues that arise at the Business Committee and the Committee on Standing Orders and Dáil Reform, including Dáil reform proposals and amendments to Standing Orders. The unit also supports the Office of the Government Chief Whip in the implementation of the Government's legislative programme. The unit assists the office of the leader of the Green Party in work relating to Cabinet, cabinet committees and oversight of the implementation of the programme for Government. The unit provides detailed information on upcoming matters in the Dáil and Seanad. It highlights any new Oireachtas reform issues and provides assistance in engaging with the new processes arising from Dáil reform. The unit is staffed by 3.5 whole-time equivalent staff, made up of 1 principal officer, 1.5 higher executive officer and 1 clerical officer.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	287	First, I am increasingly at a loss as to what this liaison unit is doing. The Taoiseach has cited its efforts - no doubt they are legion - to effect Dáil reform. Yet, not 40 minutes or an hour ago we had an exchange in which the Taoiseach steadfastly refused even the current accountability mechanisms not to mention any new innovation. I imagine we will all take that with a grain of salt. Second, I have raised with the Taoiseach the issue of the need for provision for remote learning for children living with a medically vulnerable person. I have written to him on this. He has come back with a completely unsatisfactory answer - it is almost dismissive - to the effect that health and safety standards relating to mask wearing and handwashing and so on have to be observed by these children. By the way, their parents are terrified to send them to school, such is the nature of the medical vulnerability in their homes. That was the kind of brush-off answer I got. Funny enough, when my colleague, Deputy Bríd Smith, raised the same issue with the Tánaiste, he was far more engaged on this matter. The Tánaiste informed her that he was engaging with the Minister for Education to establish exactly how an online platform could be provided for these children. There is neither rhyme nor reason to what the Taoiseach is at. He is blocking us from doing our job and, it seems, all the while not doing his own.

He committed to end Government control of Dáil business in 2016. Yet, as soon as he took over the reins, he seemed to go into reverse. As Deputy McDonald said earlier, basic levels of accountability that we expect in this House are not being complied with, as is evidenced from the Taoiseach's approach only half an hour ago in response to legitimate requests by Opposition Members to have the Minister for Justice come to the House to answer valid questions regarding the selection process for Mr. Justice Woulfe. These are valid legitimate concerns. The Taoiseach spouts all the time about the separation of powers and issues that are completely bogus. It is guff entirely. As Taoiseach, he should ensure that another central tenet of the Constitution is protected. He should ensure the ability of the Legislature to oversee and critique the function of the Executive and decisions that the Executive makes. The Minister for Justice was able to go on "Six One News" and LMFM - my local radio station and hers - yesterday to talk about this process. Yet, she does not see fit to come to this House to answer legitimate questions that Members, individually and collectively, have for her. I heard the Taoiseach say in his initial response that there was a function for the parliamentary liaison unit in supporting Green Party members. Am I right? Can the Taoiseach elaborate a little on that? Can he elaborate more generally on the actual role of the parliamentary liaison unit is at the moment given that there are no Independent members of Government?

There has essentially been a systematic drive by the Government to do that. The latest example of this is the refusal to allow the Minister for Justice to come to the House to address questions. We also saw this with the change in speaking arrangements. I have raised this several times but I am really aggrieved tonight. We have an important debate on Covid-19 strategy. Our party will have six and a half minutes. The Government will have 75 minutes. We will hear speaker after speaker backing up the Government line. Yet, we have six and a half minutes to put forward our thoughts and suggestions. To be honest, these suggestions might actually help the Government in the current situation.They might provide some important feedback to help it come to a reasonable perspective and strategy. However, we get six and a half minutes. It is a joke. The Government did that deliberately to shut the Opposition down and to push certain parts of the Opposition so far down the speaking order that their voices will not be heard. In the end, the Government's undoing will be these cynical parliamentary games it is playing to shut down the Opposition. They will always surface. The mistakes will come back to haunt the Taoiseach. I urge him to stop playing games of shutting down the Opposition and to allow for open debate in this Chamber.

We brought in many reforms after the 2016 general election. They were significant and they were advances on anything that went before. The Minister for Justice is willing to come into the House. She offered to come in next Tuesday and was turned down by the Opposition. Those are the facts. The Minister said she would come in and answer questions. Members would have to table the questions. That is fairly normal but that was refused. I have answered questions on the same issue, as did the Tánaiste. To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, answered questions, as did the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Tánaiste. There have been many examples of Ministers coming in under this Government in a short space of time on specific issues.

The three parties that make up the Government have well over 80 Members in total. It seems to be the position of Deputy Boyd Barrett and some others in the House that backbenchers and Members from the larger parties should be shut up forever and never get an opportunity. That happened in the previous Dáil, unfortunately. They were marginalised, even though they are as entitled to be heard as the Deputy. It seems to be the view of groups of six, seven, eight or more that anybody who is a Member of a large party does not have the same right or entitlement to time in a debate. It is difficult to manage it all over Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday but that is the context. The degree to which many Deputies were denied opportunities to have their voices heard appropriately in the previous Dáil simply because they were members of larger parties was a bit of a joke. That was their strong point and campaigning position.

The Deputy raises a lot of issues with me and I have answered them fairly. I do not dismiss them. It is a serious issue for the Minister for Education and her Department. I have approached them on the issue. They will have to deal with and provide for it and there has been challenges in relation to it. On the liaison unit, its main function is assisting the Government in its relationship with the Oireachtas. The main focus of the unit is to liaise with the Oireachtas at official level on procedural matters and with Departments to ensure they are aware of any new processes arising from Dáil reform. That said, in performing its duty, the unit would be happy to engage with any Member of the Oireachtas, where appropriate. It is not the function of the unit to support any Deputies in the House. That is a political function.

I will check and get further clarity on that for the Deputy. The parliamentary liaison unit is headed up by a principal officer in my Department. It is a fairly small unit. I think there are about three members. On the commitments that have been made in relation to Oireachtas reform, the unit works with the Oireachtas and officials here on advancing the reform agenda; expanding the role of the Parliamentary Budget Office to independently audit the cost of individual tax and spending measures contained in political parties' budget submissions and general election manifestos to assess their broader economic impact; and continuing to ensure that Oireachtas committees chairs are allocated according to the D'Hondt system. These are all changes which occurred in the last Dáil and had not happened before. The unit also worked on introducing a new system to register Oireachtas attendance to protect the integrity of the expenses system; ensuring that funding to Independents under the leaders' allowance is fully vouched and audited as it is for political parties; fully responding to the ruling in the Kerins Supreme Court case and making appropriate changes; reviewing the Dáil Business Committee with a view to introducing the D'Hondt system; encouraging the use of Irish as a working language of the Oireachtas; expanding Oireachtas committees' research resources; supporting the work of the Oireachtas Women's Parliamentary Caucus; and developing supports and alternatives for Members of the Oireachtas to take parental leave. Those are the broad range of activities of the liaison unit in working with the Oireachtas to try to advance and consolidate what we have achieved so far but also respond to emerging issues, such as the Kerins issue, which is finding its way through the committees and causing issues for members of various committees.

The Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change last met on 9 November 2020 and is scheduled to meet again on 7 December 2020. The members of the committee are the Taoiseach; the Tånaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Employment and Trade; the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications; the Minister for Finance; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht; the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine; the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage; and the Minister for Social Protection, and Community and Rural Development. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Pippa Hackett, is invited to the Cabinet committee and other Ministers or Ministers of State also participate as required. It is chaired by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, and Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. This Cabinet committee oversees the implementation of the programme for Government commitments in relation to the environment and climate change. These include the climate action (amendment) Bill; just transition; agriculture and land use considerations; access to finance for climate action; the development of a national retrofitting plan; and the progression of matters in furtherance of our move to a higher rate of renewable energy, such as the marine planning and development Bill and the wind energy guidelines. In addition, it considers progress made on the implementation of the current climate action plan, and the planning which is now under way to develop the next iteration of that plan.

An important component of this work is the National Biodiversity Data Centre programme, established by the Heritage Council 14 years ago. This programme collects data on Ireland's biodiversity and, thanks to the ecological commitment of its staff, the all-Ireland pollinator plan has been a tremendous success. As the Government has acknowledged, despite the centrality of the programme's work to Ireland's biodiversity commitment, it is neither a national centre nor a body. It remains privately owned and its responsibilities are delivered contract to contract with its staff also on short-term contracts. The programme's database comprises over 4 million records and is used by a range of agencies, academics and policymakers, yet this organisation and its work are not underpinned in legislation. The programme operates within a very uncertain funding framework. It appears that little value is placed on its work and that of its highly qualified staff, whose employment is precarious. I have raised this matter with the Taoiseach before and I am raising it again. I will mention funding for Dublin Zoo, which also makes an important contribution to the conservation of biodiversity beyond our small island. The Government has allocated one-off funding of €1.1 million for Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park. The Taoiseach knows that the zoo's revenue has fallen by 60% this year because of Covid and its fixed operating costs remain very high, so the one-off funding is not sufficient. It will barely cover a single month's cost for Dublin Zoo. Last week, the Taoiseach committed that the Government would do everything possible to keep Dublin Zoo viable and open. I ask him to make good on that commitment, which means providing resources in addition to those that have been announced.

Will there be significant further amendments to it? Is that being discussed by the Cabinet committee? I was stunned by a reply I received last week to a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the climate action delivery board. He confirmed to me that it had not met in a year. We are discussing the greatest existential threat facing not just this country, but the planet, yet an important body such as that, which is implementing key climate action plans, has not met. It beggars belief. The mind boggles. We knew that the previous Government's Climate Action Plan was entirely inadequate, but that the body charged with implementing it has not sat at all is extraordinary. It raises questions about the priorities of this Government. I accept that the Government has only been in place since the summer, but it begs the questions of what its priority on climate action is and what the point of the Green Party is.

It was not the first time we had seen that type of environmental damage resulting from the failure to conduct proper environmental impact assessments on such projects. This year, we were forced to pay €5 million in fines, with €15,000 per day in further penalties, as a result of the Derrybrien landslide in 2003 and the subsequent ruling of the European Court of Justice that the developers, namely, the ESB, which had built a wind farm on a mountain after cutting down the trees that held the mountain together, had ignored this basic knowledge about the role of forestation in holding mountains and soil together, thereby causing a massive landslide. We are paying €15,000 per day in penalties and have still not rectified the matter, and the same situation has occurred in Donegal. This is what happens when something as important as dealing with climate change and the development of renewable energy is put in the hands of private developers or people who are driven by profit. What will the Government do about this? Where are the directly employed ecologists, foresters and all the other people who will do the environmental impact assessment work for the State to ensure that this sort of disastrous situation does not recur?

It sums up the Taoiseach's political philosophy. It flies in the face of history. This Parliament would not exist and we would be a part of the British Empire had there not been a campaign, one with a significant military element. We would not have the right to vote, to join trade unions or to have a minimum wage. Every substantial improvement in living standards and democratic rights for ordinary people has come from campaigns. History demonstrates that. The same applies to climate action. The only reason we have a climate action Bill is environmental campaigners such as school students, strikers, Fridays for Future, Ms Greta Thunberg, etc., putting this matter on the agenda. The Government's climate action Bill has substantial flaws, though. It is a proposal to pursue carbon reductions and to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050, which will be far too late. It will not do what the science demands. In fact, those who are calling for the Bill to do what the science demands are being accused of ecopopulism by some establishment Green Party members. That is why there is a campaign to fix the Bill. There is an online petition asking that, instead of pursuing a 2050 target, the Bill should tie the Government into achieving complete decarbonisation by 2030, which is what is necessary if we are to avoid a climate disaster. There are a series of other demands concerning the just transition and so on.

He said that there was a saying in Paris, namely, that which parliament does, the street undoes. That sums up the difference in our philosophies.

The point is: Parliament and decision-makers have to make decisions. On climate change, the Deputies will again oppose everything that we bring about to get our carbon emissions down.

For example, on the Oireachtas committee in the previous Dáil, a majority of parties decided on a course of action to try for a reduction. That involved a carbon tax and to utilise that money to protect against fuel poverty and to deal with retrofitting, but also to deal with alternative farming so that we could increase and enhance our biodiversity on our farms and recalibrate agricultural performance in rural Ireland. However, that all gets opposed and then becomes the subject matter of another campaign. The bottom line is that we are running out of time. Trying to get to 2050 will be, in itself, an enormous challenge.

The climate change Bill is a good Bill. It has a whole range of commitments. It establishes a 2050 emissions target. It introduces a system of successive five-year economy-wide carbon budgets, starting in 2021. It will strengthen the role of the Climate Change Advisory Council in proposing carbon budgets. It introduces a requirement to review the Climate Action Plan annually and to prepare a national long-term climate action strategy at least every decade. It introduces a requirement for all local authorities to prepare individual climate action plans, which will include both mitigation and adaptation measures. It gives a stronger oversight role for the Oireachtas through an Oireachtas committee. I invite the Deputies to support that endeavour. Regarding the points that were raised earlier, I think Deputy Nash asked whether amendments would be forthcoming. It has gone through the pre-legislative phase. On Committee Stage, the Minister will consider any amendment that comes from the House-----

His main aim is to improve the Bill if people come forward with workable improvements. The Bill in itself is a major advance on what we have had and is something that commends itself to the House. He is open to amendments, of course, given the detailed examination that has taken place. In the House, Members may come forward on that. In relation to the climate data centre, I will have a look at that. I will talk to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about that. I accept the extraordinarily valuable work that it does and the large database that it has. I am very keen to work on similar initiatives to the all-island pollinator plan and a whole range of biodiversity projects on an all-island basis. I have made that clear to our colleagues on the Northern Ireland Executive in respect of developing joint approaches to the environment and the climate. We are looking, as part of the shared island unit, to the creation of a dialogue on an all-island approach to climate change and to the challenges that protecting the environment present to society, particularly in terms of protecting biodiversity on our island.That is important. The Government has moved quickly to try to deal with the crisis in organisations such as Dublin Zoo, Fota Wildlife Park and others. My Department has now decided to work with other Departments, the OPW, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Office of the Tánaiste to try to work out a more strategic approach to our zoos and a more sustainable system for them, in particular given the significant impact of Covid-19 on their operations. Dublin Zoo could have up to 1 million visitors a year. That has not now happened principally because of Covid. Its revenue has been significantly undermined. We are very conscious of that. We wanted to intervene this week to make sure that we could deal with the current crisis. We are very committed to helping out on a medium-term basis. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's point in respect of Donegal, there will be private development of wind projects. Not everything will be done by the State. The next big wave in respect of wind energy will be offshore wind. The marine development Bill is important because it opens up the opportunity to develop the economic potential of our seas for the betterment of our people. Wind energy is very important in terms of the climate change agenda.

Since then, Ireland and every country in Europe and throughout the world have had to take dramatic action to contain the terrible toll that this virus can take. Every aspect of social, economic and cultural life has been upended as we have worked to shield those most at risk and to limit the damage. There have been many ups and downs and the second wave of the virus, which has hit Europe in the past two months, has been divisive in many countries, with societies divided between those who accept the need for continued action and those who want all restrictions lifted. Thankfully, levels of compliance and social solidarity in Ireland have remained very high. While there are some who prize a return to certain activities over the safety of society as a whole, the overwhelming evidence suggests that the people accept the need for vigilance, personal responsibility and targeted restrictions. Let no one be in any doubt, thousands of lives have been saved by the combination of these restrictions and the personal commitment of the people to limiting the spread of the virus. Almost 3,000 people on our island have lost their lives because of the virus. This is a terrible number in itself, but it would have been many times worse without the dramatic actions that have been taken. The level 5 restrictions, which we implemented to limit the impact of the second wave in Ireland, will be reviewed by the Government in the coming days. As we decide on the next steps, I am determined that we have an open discussion about actions to date and what needs to be done in the months ahead. This is why I have requested the preparation of a detailed review of actions, the progress of the virus and key challenges facing us. It is also why I requested the holding of this debate, and I see this as an opportunity for Deputies to contribute to discussions before key decisions are taken and to be able to give their perspectives on how we will move forward. From the moment the Government took office almost five months ago, our work has been dominated by the need to manage the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic. A pandemic such as this does not come with a handbook to follow at every stage, and a defining characteristic of Covid-19 has been how the specific challenges it has presented have constantly evolved.The very worst thing one could have in the response to this pandemic is a consistent and unchanging approach. If we look throughout the world, many countries promoted during the first wave as the models to follow are in much worse positions today. I am proud of the fact that we have been willing to respond quickly to new challenges, review actions and look for new ways forward. I thank all of my colleagues in government for their willingness to accept an unprecedented intensity in the review, development and implementation of policy. Together with public servants, who are absolutely dedicated to serving the interests of the Irish people, this work has made a very real impact. This morning's figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control give a very clear picture of the progress our country has made during the second wave of the virus. Ireland has the second lowest incidence of infection in the European Union, with case numbers and deaths very substantially below both the average and what might have occurred if patterns from the first wave had been repeated. Deaths are 90% below the level of the first wave. At the same time, many more critical public services have remained active, our schools have been open, and economic activity, while still badly affected, has been higher. This did not happen by chance. It happened because the Irish people accepted the need to alter their behaviour and accepted key restrictions. Masks are a key tool in limiting the spread of the virus. The introduction of the mask guidelines in July increased the numbers wearing them in shops, on buses and in other indoor spaces from 37% to 90%. Travel is also critical to the spread of the virus, including different strains of the virus. The decision to limit the easing of travel guidelines in July and August was inconvenient for many, but the figures suggest it has made an important contribution to avoiding the levels of travel-related infections seen in other countries. Testing capacity is critical to understanding and catching the virus. When figures were very low in August, we decided not to scale down testing and to keep in place critical sectoral testing programmes. More than 1.8 million tests have been completed, with a weekly testing capacity of 140,000 in place. There have been occasional problems but, in general, the testing capacity has been fast and effective. We have one of the more high-performing systems of testing across Europe and globally. A total of 62% of the positive cases identified in the testing have had no underlying clinical conditions. Contacting, testing and isolating asymptomatic cases are a critical part of limiting the spread of the virus. I acknowledge the incredible work of the HSE and other bodies in leading this critical part of the response. I also want to acknowledge again the work of our health professionals. They have moved swiftly both to develop and adopt new approaches to managing Covid cases. Success in treating severe cases has improved remarkably fast. At the same time, major efforts have been made to restore non-Covid activity in our hospitals. The return of children to schools was a core priority for us and it is worth mentioning again today. It was a daunting logistical and public health challenge and enormous credit is due to everyone involved. It is not possible to have zero spread of the virus among more than 1 million people, but the fact that its spread appears to be at a lower level in schools than in the community as a whole is a remarkable achievement. Evidence has shown the great pressure which school closures placed on children and their families. Almost one fifth of women with children in school were unable to work during school closures and a much larger number of parents faced increased pressure and limits on their ability to work. The economic recession caused by the pandemic has required a range of unprecedented measures which we continue to update and review. Within a month of taking office, we prepared, published and implemented a dramatic stimulus package to protect as many jobs as possible. This was built on in October's budget, which provides a foundation for the recovery that I know we can rapidly achieve. The biggest impact on containing the second wave was, of course, the decision to move, first, to an enhanced level 3 and then, in light of the escalating problem in Europe and the need to exercise added caution, to move to level 5. The second wave is not over by any means. If there is one thing we know now, it is that taking the virus for granted is the foundation for its spread. Infection rates can very quickly get out of control if people believe it is no longer a threat. Ireland's relative success in the second wave has been because we were willing to act. We had a less comprehensive reopening than many other countries. Individually, we continued to modify our behaviour. When the threat of high levels of transmission appeared, we acted. After nine months, the one overwhelming fact about this deadly virus is that it thrives in social settings. Therefore, we must respect social distancing. We have to limit our social interactions. The very thing we value most in our society, which is our sense of family and community, can be a major threat when we hold social gatherings and move in hospitality settings. That is a hard message when we have endured so much this year, but it is one we simply must understand if we are to continue to limit deaths and serious illness in this pandemic. As we look forward to the next stage, complacency will remain our enemy. We are not yet in a position to return to normality or close to normality. Our approach will continue to be to go as far as possible but no further. I accept the goodwill of every group that is calling for the relaxation of restrictions impacting on them. They care passionately about their businesses and their sectors. I fully accept their statements that they want to respect guidelines. However, the reality is that, for some activities, the guidance will be that there is too much risk. For all activities, there are core guidelines and restrictions on how we act that must be respected. In the past few weeks, there has been great news about promising vaccines. An effective and widely used vaccine is the final route to recovering from the pandemic. I want to say again that the Government will do everything to make sure the Irish people have rapid, fair and comprehensive access to the vaccines. There remain vital checks to be completed before the vaccines are authorised for public use. However, we have begun critical steps. In the summer, we joined an EU joint initiative to place advance contracts for purchasing different vaccines. This EU initiative is vital for smaller countries in ensuring fair access. The major logistical, medical and ethical issues involved in the roll-out of a vaccine are being addressed by a cross-public service task force which we have established. Its external chairman, Professor Brian MacCraith, has run a major university and is an internationally respected scientific leader. Between today and when the vaccines are widely administered, we must remain vigilant and we must accept the need to limit our activities. As a country, we have worked together to achieve great things in limiting the spread and impact of this deadly virus. That work is not over yet but we have shown how much we can achieve. In the coming days, we will decide and outline in detail the next phase of our national response. I have no doubt that if we maintain our national solidarity, we will be able to look back at our shared response to the pandemic as a moment when we faced great danger together and came through it with strength and determination.

As we all know, the Government faces a difficult decision in the week ahead. As we approach the end of six weeks of level 5 restrictions, we sail between Scylla and Charybdis in trying to set the right course. In doing so, we know for certain that increased human interaction will result in more people getting infected, thus increasing the chances of a third wave. 2020 has been a write-off for many families and many businesses and for young and old alike. For others, it has been a year of grief, with 3,000 lives lost across Ireland. We should never forget those who grieve and I extend my condolences to them once more. While we have not done everything right as a Government or as a society, I believe we have managed the pandemic well compared with our peers. We acted quickly in our response. Today, the 14-day incidence of the virus is the third lowest in Europe. Even though we use the widest measure to count deaths, recording even suspected cases, we rank 34th in the world, and falling, in terms of mortality. It is clear now that the second wave has been very different from the first. While the number of cases detected has been many times greater, the numbers of hospitalisations, patients requiring admission to an ICU and deaths, fortunately, have been much lower. Indeed, there is no evidence yet of any statistically significant increase in excess deaths in the second wave in Ireland. Of course, had we not acted as we did, this would almost certainly not have been the case and we would have experienced high levels of excess deaths such as are now being seen in other parts of Europe. There are many reasons the second wave was not as serious as the first. These include more testing, a younger cohort of people getting infected, the older and infirm being better protected and better knowledge of how to treat the disease. Those trends are likely to continue. The fact that the second wave was so different from the first is significant and should guide us in how we go forward. First of all, it is clear that there should not be an overemphasis on case numbers, particularly daily case numbers.Cases translate into hospitalisations and deaths, but not at rates previously projected. Once again, our health service never came close to being overwhelmed. It also seems there is a seasonal component to SARS-CoV-2, just as there is for other coronaviruses. This is bad news for now but good news for the spring, when it comes. Level 3 was probably more effective that we thought at the time. Level 5 was not as effective as was modelled, but was needed to get the numbers down lower. It is worth noting that the objective set out by Government five weeks ago was the R number consistently below one and cases and hospitalisations falling, rather than NPHET's model-based target of an R number of less than 0.5 and cases of less than 100. Trajectory is also important and the situation can deteriorate rapidly and return to exponential growth. While we know much more about the virus, it is just as contagious and transmissible as it was previously. I believe we should seek to ease restrictions next week but not so much that it requires it to return to level 4 or 5 for a prolonged period in the new year. A short third period of enhanced restrictions may well be necessary in January or February, but we should try to avoid it being a prolonged one. Our strategy of suppression is perhaps best described as one of "delay and vaccinate" and I do not believe we are too far away from seeing it succeed. Safe and effective vaccines are on the way, and when we vaccinate those most at risk, such as nursing home residents and healthcare workers - approximately 200,000 people - we will change the calculus for future decision-making. It will reduce the R number, case numbers and mortality rates even as we extend the vaccine more widely to other groups, as we must, to achieve herd immunity. Antigen mass testing, notwithstanding its limitations, will have a role to play in 2021 in identifying more cases, more quickly and reducing the risk of spread. It is well-understood that there are risks associated with international travel. This is particularly so when it comes to travel from areas of high incidence to areas of low incidence. The European traffic light system, which Government has adopted, linked to pre and post-travel testing, does not eliminate this risk but it does reduce it. We need to embrace it and enforce it. Another real risk that we cannot ignore is North-South travel within Ireland. The incidence of the virus in Northern Ireland is a multiple of what it is in the State and so is the mortality rate. Northern Ireland is a different jurisdiction and makes its own decisions under the Good Friday Agreement. We respect that, but we would be in denial not to recognise that a less intensive approach to the virus there, since the start, has had its consequences. Our public health authorities collect very good data on cases imported to Ireland due to international travel and even cases related to imported cases. Such data do not exist for cases linked to cross-Border travel on the island. This is a gap in our data that needs to be closed as it affects our ability to make evidence-based decisions. As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my responsibility is to protect jobs, businesses and livelihoods, to create the conditions where we can safely return to work and stay at work and to give everyone with a job confidence for today, as well as hope for the future. The Government has put in place extraordinary measures to protect incomes and keep businesses alive - the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, restart grants, low cost loans, a commercial rates holiday, lower VAT, wage subsidies and the weekly payment for businesses that are closed and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. It is essential that these interventions should continue as necessary and should not be removed too quickly. For this reason, we have set aside €3.5 billion for 2021 in the form of an unallocated recovery fund so we can respond to the twin challenges of Brexit and Covid. While the pot is limited, and has to last the full year, we should not be afraid to deploy it. When it comes to decisions on reopening, the Government has a particular responsibility to provide clear guidance to the public and to businesses. We also need to marshal our agencies, from the Garda, to HSE environmental health officers to Health and Safety Authority, HSA, inspectors, to improve enforcement. Last Friday, to assist, we published an updated Work Safely Protocol, which sets out the actions that need to be taken to reduce the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace. Unfortunately, many see the debate about what to do in December as a conflict between protecting lives and protecting jobs, as if our society and our economy were in some kind of contest. This is a false dichotomy and always has been. It is as though the people who work in shops or own a small business do not also worry about their own health, and that of their family and loved ones and as if the people who are most at risk from Covid do not also yearn for the company of other people, to be able to do some shopping or to enjoy some Christmas cheer. In an ideal world we would be able to provide certainty to businesses and to consumers, and give plenty of advance notice but, sadly, we cannot. There are, unfortunately, too many moving parts, too many factors beyond our control and too many new things to take into account every day but we will give as much notice as we can. Covid-19 behaves in unexpected ways so we have to plan for every eventuality, and make decisions based on changing evidence, new developments and new facts. During this period of restrictions, many of us have become frustrated and downcast, annoyed by examples of people breaking the rules, and impatient for things to reopen and return to the way they were before. Too many lives have been lost. Too many lives have been put on hold for too long, especially for younger people. No one is immune from feelings of anger, resentment, fear or frustration, but we will not fight community transmission with anger, blame or finger-pointing. We will beat it with community spirit – just as we did before. As a country, even in the darkest days, we never lost hope. We have a little way to go still but we should not lose hope now. As a Government we will do everything we can, but this will not be a normal Christmas. We will have to limit ourselves and our movements. We will have to be patient. We will have be tolerant of each other and understanding of lapses, while all the time reinforcing, renewing and resuming our efforts against Covid-19. For centuries, people have debated the true meaning of Christmas - the original wish upon a star. At its most meaningful, it is about thinking of others and about bringing happiness to others, about hope and good news. This year will be a Christmas like no other, but it can still be a good one if we keep the faith.

This year has tested us all. It has tested our mettle, our resolve and our resilience. None of us could have expected that we would live this reality, with our people and our communities robbed of the simple everyday things that make up our lives. It has been a year of stress, worry and uncertainty brought by a global pandemic. People have lost. People have missed out. Thousands have lost their jobs and their incomes. Many have lost their businesses and their plans for the future. We have all missed out on precious time with our families and we miss out on our simple routines. Most tragically, thousands of families have lost a loved one to this awful virus, and while we all may wonder what kind of Christmas we will be able to have this year, we know that for these families Christmas this year will be defined by the pain and sorrow of the empty chair. We, therefore, send our heartfelt condolences and good wishes to every grieving family. It is also important to recognise how much effort has been made - the work of our front-line staff, the fantastic work in local communities, and the patience and discipline shown by all our people, especially by our young people. While it is usually those moments where people make mistakes or fail to live up to the public health standards that make the headlines, the truth is that our people have been inspirational and we are enduring and will endure and prevail because of their kindness, their compassion and their social solidarity. Recent news of progress with vaccines has brought much needed hope as we finally see some glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. However, this Christmas will be like no other and we must acknowledge that. We must also acknowledge that being with family will take on an additional significance this year for people at home and abroad. Of course, people will not travel home from abroad as they do in other years, but common sense and compassion needs to be applied, especially for families that have had a particularly bad year such as those who have suffered a bereavement but who could not come home to grieve and families with elderly relatives, perhaps isolated all year struggling with separation and mental health challenges.For them, coming home this Christmas is an essential journey. I am calling for compassion and common sense to guide all public health advice on Christmas travel, family meetings and socialising this season. There are people who have not seen a day's work since March. Their family income has been decimated and they face into Christmas very unsure not just about Christmas but about their future. On 21 October, we entered into level 5 restrictions. This was a tough but necessary decision to suppress the spread of the virus, stop people getting sick and prevent our health services from becoming overwhelmed. It was a huge body blow for everyone. People had made enormous sacrifices during the first lockdown to flatten the curve and to get transmission of the virus down to manageable levels. This dedication and collective effort bought the Government time and space to do the things necessary to give us the very best chance of avoiding yo-yoing in and out of damaging lockdowns. However, if "We are all in this together" was the Government mantra in the initial months of this pandemic, that was torn up by the decisions the Government made this autumn. When entry into level 5 was announced, we said it would be unforgivable for Government to waste a second opportunity to do things right. We said that the lockdown must be used to put in place everything needed to get the virus under control and to keep it under control. We said that the aim of all must be that what we do now helps avoid future lockdowns. We said that it would be devastating to tell businesses that they can open up now only to shut them down again in a couple of weeks. We said that could prove to be a body blow for some from which they might not recover and we asked the Government to put in place measures that would provide much-needed certainty for workers and business. The lockdown was tough but it was the Government's opportunity to get on top of the virus. Now the question is whether the Government has done enough. Is testing and tracing now fit for purpose? Is mass testing on the cards? Is testing at our airports and ports to be delivered? I think the answer to all of these questions is “No”. This is compounded by the fact that we still do not have an all-Ireland plan for tackling the virus. The deficit is much more than one simple data set; we need a full strategy and plan. All of these failures leave us vulnerable to infection and lockdown in the new year and that is not good enough. We need to agree on that and that we can do so much better. The plan for the roll-out of the vaccines must be comprehensive and carry with it all necessary urgency. Economic and income supports need to stay in place while there is any prospect of restrictions, so that workers and businesses have the best possible chance to come back next year. By the way, arbitrary deadlines do not work on these matters and lead to very great uncertainty. While I welcome the extension of the pandemic unemployment payment, we need to ensure that any cuts the Government may have had in mind are not proceeded with. People have been through so much and now we look forward to Christmas and being together with family again. As we head into the new year, we need to give people hope that we can emerge from this unprecedented crisis stronger, fairer and better. We must prioritise affordable housing, improving our public health system and addressing youth unemployment. We must prioritise those who have lost jobs and livelihoods, the forgotten carers and the young people now worried about their futures. We must learn from Covid. We need to learn what really matters and then act on that.

This can be achieved by exiting restrictions safely this year, with the protections in place to avoid future lockdowns in the new year. That means getting the basics right and requires testing and tracing with a dedicated workforce; mass testing; a proper system of travel restrictions with robust airport testing; adequately-funded public health departments; and, vitally, all-island co-operation. All plans must be guided by public health advice. This is the only way to keep people safe and this can only be achieved if we keep the case numbers low. Understandably, people will want to travel home for Christmas. It is clear that not everybody will travel home this year. However, we need fair and proportionate approaches for those travelling home on compassionate grounds. This means stepping up testing at airports and clear communication on public health advice for those who do travel. We must ensure common-sense and effective travel restrictions North and South and cross-Border co-operation. Our island should be a single unit for dealing with this virus, yet that is not being reflected in the Government’s approach so far. Contact tracing across the Border, which is far from the most difficult task, does not seem to be happening. There is a memorandum of understanding in place which we supported and which is helpful, but I have been asking the HSE for months how this is being implemented in practice and I have yet to receive an adequate response. Income supports for workers, families and businesses are vital in the year and time ahead. Many workers, families and businesses have made huge sacrifices. We all accept that. There are some businesses which have been closed since March. There have been many workers who have been out of work. Many people have seen their incomes decimated. Even with the pandemic unemployment payment, they are down huge amounts of money and struggling to pay bills. It will be a very difficult and challenging Christmas for all of those individuals. Many have lost everything and the Government support has been inadequate. We pointed that out several times during the summer months when the Tánaiste and the Government he led were busy cutting payments like the pandemic unemployment payment when it should have been investing in testing and tracing. Under pressure, the Government reversed some of those cuts. My colleague, Deputy Louise O’Reilly, will address some of these important issues later. This week has been emblematic of this Government's approach to managing Covid-19 and many different issues. A decision on what will happen next was essentially announced on Monday by the Taoiseach and reinforced today by the Tánaiste. We are now debating that fundamental decision. Tomorrow, we were supposed to engage with NPHET at the Joint Committee on Health on its advice to Government. I am assuming NPHET has not given that advice yet but will give it in the next number of days. That meeting was cancelled because, again, NPHET was not in a position to appear before the health committee. On Thursday, we were to hear what that advice was. A normal process would have the advice come first, then committee engagement, followed by a debate before a decision is reached. It is fair to say that, thanks to the sacrifice of the Irish people, cases have been somewhat brought under control. We all celebrate the fact the numbers have come down, albeit not as fast as we might like. They are not exactly where we want them to be but they have come down. Despite Government spin to the contrary - I address this point to the Tánaiste as well - NPHET has called this right every time it has called it. I am not convinced this Government has a handle on things. Of course NPHET gives advice and of course the Government has to make wider societal and economic decisions, but making decisions in advance of getting the advice from NPHET seems to be problematic. There are still more than 800 workers redeployed to tracing when the Government has had six months to ensure a dedicated workforce was in place. This is causing complications across our health service. I commend each and every one of our front-line healthcare workers who have done Trojan work in recent months. The decision by the Government to redeploy staff to testing and tracing from other areas is having consequences. It is delaying rehabilitation for stroke victims.It is delaying care for children with scoliosis. It is causing waiting lists for access to disability services to skyrocket. The Government has committed to hiring 10,000 additional healthcare staff next year, or so it says, yet 1,500 people who have been in Be on Call for Ireland pool and available to work have not been offered any contract for seven months or more. Where in God's name is the logic in this when at budget time we had the Minister for Health speaking about recruiting 15,000 staff? All of these staff are still in a pool waiting to be hired. These are people who came home from all corners of the world. The Taoiseach is shaking his head but these are the figures and that is the reality. The unfairness at the heart of the Government's attitude to healthcare workers does not bode well for that relationship. Our healthcare workers have been through a very tough year, in fact the toughest yet. They worked hard and tirelessly through a difficult winter last year, and then through the spring, summer and autumn of this year, without rest as they tackled Covid, and now another difficult winter looms. We are in their debt. Whatever decisions we take, and whatever decisions the Government takes, they cannot add more pressure to our public health services in January, February and March of next year. We cannot allow the chaos in our hospitals that we have seen previously to become even worse next year. The Taoiseach shakes his head in bemusement-----

I want to finish very quickly, if I can, on the development of several effective vaccines, which is exciting news. It is vital we get distribution and administration right. It has to be rapid and fair with clear processes in place. I welcome the high-level task force put in place. I have asked for the persons involved in the task force to come before the health committee.

More than 70,000 people have contracted Covid and, sadly, more than 2,000 people have lost their lives due to this virus. On behalf of the Labour Party, I express solidarity with all of those who have been impacted by Covid-19, especially those who will have a loved one missing from the dinner table this Christmas. The Government has to make some extremely difficult decisions this week when it comes to Covid-19 and exiting level 5 restrictions. We want to see, as does the public, that the experiences and learning of the past eight months have been taken on board for planning the exit from level 5. There needs to be a slow, methodical, evidence-based step-down approach and a moving through the levels. There needs to be proper messaging on public health guidelines, social distancing, mask wearing and handwashing, and clear and concise communication from the Government on the nature of the restrictions at each point of the scale. It is pleasing to see the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health engaging at present. Perhaps it would be useful if they listened to what Opposition Members have to say. Christmas in Ireland will officially start when the "Late Late Toy Show" is aired on Friday, and whether or not one is a Christian, it is a special time of celebration here. We need to be acutely aware of the added complications that will come with the festive season this year. Our contact tracing system must also be able to cope with any increase in cases before and after Christmas. We have seen a number of private companies set up testing sites at various locations throughout the country, with further sites due to open within weeks. While this expansion of testing is welcome, the tracing system needs to be beefed up to ensure it can cope with additional demand over the festive season and into the key month of January. January worries me, as I think it worries everyone in the House. We had a worrying but avoidable situation unravel in October, when thousands of close contacts of positive Covid cases went uncontacted and the contact tracing system became overwhelmed because it was not properly resourced and planned. There can be no excuse if our contact tracing system becomes overwhelmed again. We have been here before and we should know what level of demand the tracing system can take and what needs to be done to make it fit for purpose. The Taoiseach and his colleagues in government need to ensure the necessary staff are recruited and ready for the festive period and that, if necessary, the Defence Forces are placed on notice that their skills and services may be called upon. Private testing companies do not carry out contact tracing and our tracing system must be able to cope with the additional demand. There are thousands of competent people who can be brought in to carry out contact tracing if necessary, such as retired public servants, retired health professionals, people who have been made unemployed as a result of the pandemic and people who could be seconded from various organisations. The Labour Party is calling for assurances that everything that can be done is being done regarding support for our contact tracing system. A true national effort is required to avoid future level 5 escalation. We need to hear that the Government is prepared to go into areas affected in the early stages, identify the index cases, aggressively test, trace and isolate and vigorously hunt down the virus to limit its spread. This is the type of policy approach that has been sadly lacking to date. The news that we now have three vaccines which are testing well is giving us all a lift and it is a lift we all need at present. We need to know about the planned roll-out of the Covid vaccine in detail and the discussions with the European Commission on the contract to purchase 300 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, when it will be available and how much of it will come to Ireland. There needs to be co-ordination across society and an indicative plan for healthcare. I hope we will be able to administer it a whole lot better than we are at giving out the flu vaccine because we need to dramatically improve our approach before we roll out the Covid vaccine. As a Dáil, we need to stand up to ill-informed anti-vaccine discourse more generally and strongly. Vaccine hesitancy is one thing but in the past decade there has been a small but vocal minority decrying all vaccines. It is dangerous. That is dangerous talk. This vaccine has the potential to be a game changer and bring back some normality to our lives. We should let the science speak clearly. The Labour Party calls for a strong public information campaign on a vaccine when it is introduced on the Irish market to debunk any misinformation. This year has been an extremely difficult year for so many but let us all hope that with the Government response and a real sense of national unity and solidarity, as the Taoiseach stated earlier, and the personal responsibility we all need to show, particularly over the coming weeks, we will see better days ahead in 2021.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	331	I will take this opportunity to update the House on the Government's ongoing response to Covid-19. Right now, as we look to exit level 5, we are at a critical juncture. From a healthcare perspective, we are facing the most challenging winter in living memory, and the solidarity and resilience that have been shown by our healthcare workers and the entire country will be more important than ever in the coming weeks. We are five weeks into the level 5 measures and, like many countries, Ireland has faced big decisions on the measures we need to limit the virus and on the impact these measures have on individuals, families, communities and businesses. More than 70,000 people have now tested positive and more than 2,000 have died. Every one of these represents a mother, father, son or daughter who has tragically passed away and who is mourned by their families and friends. Two weeks ago, the Special Committee on Covid 19 Response published its report, having listened to several months' worth of evidence and I thank the committee members for all of their work. Many of the issues the committee highlighted are being seen around the globe. We know the disease is having a devastating effect internationally.Over 58 million cases of the disease have been reported to the World Health Organization and, tragically, almost 1.4 million deaths have been notified. Many countries have had, and continue to have, big challenges in their response to the disease. Some are facing significant and damaging impacts on their healthcare systems as more and more Covid patients require hospitalisation. Thankfully, we are not at that level in Ireland. In Europe, only Finland has a lower 14-day incidence rate. Our 14-day rate was 310 per 100,000 four weeks ago. That has gone down to 109 today and is continuing to fall. It is the biggest decline anywhere in Europe. The people deserve huge credit for the work that has gone into making that happen. There are, however, signs that progress has slowed. By the end of the third week at level 5, the reproduction number, or R number, had fallen right down to 0.6 but it is fair to say that the fourth week was not a great week. I think people were tired and compliance fell. We could not blame anybody as it has been a very difficult year. However, the result was that the number of cases flatlined, the R number was recalculated and while it stayed below 1, it had gone back up to 0.8. It will be recalculated late tomorrow night or early on Thursday, and, hopefully, we will see it come back down again. We really need to double down on the last seven or eight days of level 5 to push it right back down. The evidence also shows a recent increase in the level of social contacts. A small extra effort by everyone to limit and reduce our number of contacts will make a big difference right through to the end of the year. At present, there are 98 clusters in residential care facilities which remain open, of which 48 are in nursing homes, so it is still a high number. There have been some large outbreaks in hospitals, as colleagues will be aware, and we are tracking numerous other outbreaks across the country, including those associated with funerals and other workplaces. All of this remains a concern and is being monitored daily. Another area we are looking at is the number of close contacts who have not taken up the offer of testing. I would ask for the help of colleagues in the Chamber to get the message out. Many people who were deemed close contacts are being tested but some are choosing not to get tested. It is very important that everyone deemed a contact volunteers for testing. The testing programme has expanded hugely and we now have capacity, if we need it, to do up to 140,000 tests per week. That gives us one of the highest capacities anywhere in the world. The HSE deserves huge credit for being able to do that from a standing start. Over 1.8 million tests have now been done and the serial testing in nursing homes, in direct provision and in meat processing plants is ongoing, as well as mass school testing, when it is deemed appropriate by the public health leads. Contact tracing is a big focus for colleagues and for me. The numbers have ramped very significantly and we have gone from 231 tracers in mid-September to 700. We are on our way to 800 in total. These figures do not include the contact tracers who were already working in public health departments, who are responsible for more complex contact tracing. I am delighted to share other news here as well. I recently announced a doubling of our public health workforce in the country. I am delighted to share with colleagues that, right now, over 200 interviews are ongoing and a further 200 interviews are scheduled. Good progress has been made in this regard as well. Much of the contact tracing effort, here and abroad, focuses on forward contact tracing, that is, identifying people who may be infected by the people we know about or, in other words, finding out who their close contacts are. Our public health departments also do what is called backwards contact tracing, retrospective contact tracing or source identification. This involves understanding not who a person may affect, as that is the forward tracing, but going backwards and trying to identify the sources of infection. That is to do two things. It is to help us understand what sort of environments are driving infections but also, if we can get to them quickly, we can find other ways of contacting the people who were at those events and tell them that they too are deemed a close contact and they need to get a test and restrict their movements. There is growing evidence of super spreaders. This is the idea that a small number of people or a small number of events can lead to a very high number of cases, and it is making backward contact tracing even more important. I am very happy to be able to share with colleagues that the HSE has done a huge amount of work in this regard. In fact, I was on a call with the HSE earlier today. Backward contact tracing is now moving well beyond where it has been deployed to date with the public health departments on complex cases because we now have this workforce of 700 and growing. Encouragingly, as colleagues will be aware, we have seen the emergence of very positive results in terms of vaccine candidates. The reported positive trial results from AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna provide reason for optimism, if cautious optimism. However, it should be noted that all proposed Covid vaccines will require approval from the European Medicines Agency. Colleagues will be aware that Ireland is participating in the process led by the European Union to procure vaccine supplies. It is an advanced purchase agreement being led by the EU and, as of this morning, we have signed up to five such vaccines. A good amount of work remains to be done before we have a full understanding of the effectiveness of the vaccines, how long they provide immunity for, whether the effectiveness differs across particular age groups and whether it is more effective with symptomatic people, for example. Most importantly, we need assurances as to the safety of the vaccines. There are grounds for a real optimism. We are beginning to see the breakthroughs needed to move Ireland and the world on from a world dominated by Covid-19. However, until a vaccine is here and until it is widely distributed, we have to continue to rely on the tools that are available to us right now. The scenes unfolding across Europe in recent weeks provide a stark reminder of just how bad things can get. The Dutch, for example, have had to transport patients to Germany amid of surge of cases there, Italy’s death toll, tragically, has surpassed 50,000 people in recent days and there are some really difficult things going on in countries across the European Union and across the world. These are the scenes we wanted to avoid. That is why the Government agreed to the extensive measures required in recent months to limit the spread of the virus, to keep people safe, to keep the schools open and to ensure that the hospitals and the intensive care units are not overrun. As colleagues will fully appreciate, if our health facilities were to be overrun, not only would this have a very serious impact on Covid-19 patients, but it would have a massive impact on non-Covid patients as elective care would have to be curtailed, which would lead to some very serious results. Ultimately, the measures taken, the efforts from our front-line workers, the efforts from every person, every family, every community and every business, are all about saving lives. If the virus did not kill people, we could, for example, argue in favour of a herd immunity strategy, depending on how much damage it did. However, it does kill people, and all of the efforts, all of the measures, all of the hygiene, all of the contact tracing and testing, and everything that has been done, has been about keeping people alive and limiting the number of fatalities. It goes without saying that any one loss of life is one too many. It is worth reflecting, however, that if we look at the fatalities in the first wave versus the second wave here in Ireland, there has been a reduction of more than 90% in fatalities. For every ten people we lost in the first wave to Covid-19, we have lost one in the second wave. It really is worth re-emphasising that this comes down to our healthcare workers but also to front-line workers right across the country and the sacrifices that everybody has been making.The question now is how we exit level 5 in a way that keeps the virus as suppressed as possible and we all know we will not have the same level of suppression when we leave level 5, while at the same time opening as much as possible. The next few months will be challenging and there is no point in stating otherwise, but there is much to be optimistic about. I look forward to continuing to listen to colleagues' ideas on how we exit level 5 and work on moving forward in the coming weeks and months.

The approach for travel into and out of Ireland must be guided by the public health advice. The emphasis should be on adhering to the public health advice, advising against all non-essential travel, continuing the excellent work of keeping Covid-19 numbers down and avoiding the risk of importing cases but we also know that people have sacrificed a great deal this year. For some people, for example those who have suffered a bereavement, are struggling with their mental health or isolation, coming home for Christmas is an essential journey. While many will choose to stay abroad this year, we need to exercise compassion and common sense and the State needs to prepare for those who do travel. Central to that preparation is clarity and advice and ensuring that people who intend to travel know what is expected of them in terms of the traffic light system, restrictions of movement etc. Equally important is the system of checks and controls we have at ports and airports to minimise the risk of importing the virus. The system we have in place is not fit for purpose and there are no plans to improve it before Christmas. On contact tracing, the passenger locator form and follow-up is entirely inadequate. On testing, PCR testing is available at airports, which is something, but it is expensive. That is a problem. Also, it is entirely voluntary, which is an even greater problem. I am very concerned that many people will opt out of the airport testing system, which is allowed. In fact, the Minister's Government is expecting it. In the Dáil on 12 November, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, said they are expecting demand for testing to be in the region of 150 to 300 tests per day. When people, myself included, were confused about that figure in terms of whether it was expected demand or expected supply, the Department of Transport clarified that it was the expected demand. Based on October's figures, 150 to 300 tests a day would equate to less than 3% of travelling passengers. It might not be 3% but it is a long way off 100%. If too many people opt out of testing and we have no follow-up on passenger locator forms we are leaving ourselves exposed. The system must be improved and there are options such as mandatory testing, rapid antigen testing and investment in the passenger locator form follow-up. I encourage the Minister to improve on those areas.

I do not believe anyone would dispute that. For weeks, businesses have been calling for clarity regarding Christmas trading. The public were looking for information on the public health measures that would be in place for Christmas and how things will look after 1 December. Today, the Tánaiste tweeted that we are on our way out of level 5 but he did not tweet about what is coming after that so we have mothers and fathers who do not know what size turkey, nut roast or whatever they are having for Christmas to order because they do not know if their children will be home. We have workers who cannot arrange their lives over the festive period because they do not know if they will be working or what work will look like. We have businesses that do not know how many staff they will have to roster, the stock they will need to order, the additional health and safety protections that will be necessary or their opening and closing hours. Essentially, they have no idea what trading will look like. I have been in touch with countless businesses and many reached out to me in advance of speaking in this debate to relay their concerns about having no clarity on what next week will bring. The Hamlet bar, in Balbriggan, Pottager Restaurant, in Skerries, the Manor Inn, in Swords, The Snug, in Skerries and Kealy's of Cloghran are a tiny fraction of the number of people who have reached out because businesses are desperate at this stage. In normal times, planning for Christmas takes place months in advance, therefore, it is completely unfair during a pandemic to leave businesses in the dark regarding the nature of Christmas trading. The Government, along with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Health, should be sitting down with businesses - it should have been done before now - and with workers' representatives from the trade union movement, to give them an idea of what they can expect. That would have been the best way to ensure that businesses can plan to operate in a safe and secure manner which protects workers and customers because that is what they want to do. They want to protect their staff and their customers but they want to trade. Instead, it is being left to the last minute for families and businesses alike and because of that workers, small businesses and families will be left scrambling. People know that Christmas will not be the same this year as last year. They are already across that and, for very many people, all they want is to get Christmas over with but for 2021 can we please have deeper engagement with businesses, workers and their representatives? I urge the Minister and his colleagues to be imaginative, think outside the box and consider measures that will stimulate the economy such as the voucher scheme introduced by my colleague, Conor Murphy, in the North. I ask him to be imaginative, plan ahead and allow us to get a good start on 2021 for workers, jobs and the general public.

I was expecting a Government representative to be called in light of the insistence of a change in the order a few months ago. I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this issue. I want to say at the outset that I do not for a moment underestimate the challenges involved in taking the kind of decisions that are required over the coming weeks. There is no doubt that there is a lot of pressure on, some of which I believe is coming internally from Government parties, and a lot of expectation. Clearly, the question of public health and safety must be paramount in this. I recognise the fact that it is very difficult to strike that balance to ensure that businesses have a fair opportunity to trade and that we are very mindful of the challenges ahead in terms of an upsurge in the virus. Undoubtedly, it is difficult to strike that balance between allowing some level of celebration and business to take place during December while also being mindful of the fact that the more we celebrate, the more chances there are that some time in the new year we will have to go into a third lockdown. I am disappointed that no attempt has been made to involve Opposition parties. The right way of going about this would have been to take an all-party approach. I have said to the Taoiseach over many months that it is regrettable he did not take that on board. That would involve sharing the data with other parties and sharing the decision-making also. All of us were up for that. In fairness, across the board Opposition parties have been very responsible and reasonable. On those few occasions when there were briefings we asked to be included in the decision-making. There would have been very definite benefits in including, on a cross-party basis, all parties in respect of the public health messaging. That would have been powerful but I believe that has been a missed opportunity. It would have been all the better if we could have had a united approach. Many of us have been asking for that. It is critical that the decisions that will be taken over the coming days are based on the data and on a proper risk assessment. If the Minister wants to bring people with him he has to explain the reason some businesses can open, others can open in limited ways or some not at all. It is very important that the science and the risk assessment is provided on the reason those decisions are being taken. That is how the Minister will keep people with him. Obviously, that rationale has to be shared across the board. There needs to be certainty for business as soon as possible because a lead-in is required for restaurants in particular. If there is to be an opening for pubs that serve food and so on and for retail in general they need that certainty and, in the case of restaurants, they need a two-week lead-in period. I hope those decisions can be announced before the weekend. With regard to retail, I am assuming that non-essential retail will be allowed open up fairly soon. In that case it is very important that the Government ensures there are extended opening hours for retail, not only for their own sakes but from the point of view of reducing pressure and congregation and that the footfall can be smoothed out somewhat.The footfall could be smoothed out somewhat so that we do not have a rush for the undoubtedly pent-up demand. We can spread that demand out over busy peak periods in order to reduce the danger of congregating. I ask the Government to make an extra effort to make the messaging clear to people. We need to keep repeating the original, basic messages. That is essential. The Government needs to do two things. First, it needs to be clear about the role of ventilation. The Government and NPHET have recognised that ventilation plays a significant role in reducing the spread of the virus. At this time of year when it is cold outside, there is a tendency to close windows and doors to keep heat in. There is a definite tendency over the Christmas period for people to spend long hours together at home in enclosed areas. The Government has to concentrate on getting out the message of how important it is to have air circulation and ventilation to reduce the spread of the virus. The second clear message the Government needs to get out to people relates to the dangers that could arise in this period, and for people to limit their contacts. We all want to be with family and extended family. If the Government gives clear messages to people about what they need to do to reduce the circles they mix in, that helps. Christmas is a time when there might be much pressure on extended family to visit, call, come for dinner and spend a long time doing so. Clear messaging would be helpful because, instinctively, the vast majority of people are quite nervous about what Christmas might bring, in the worst sense. We all want it to be as good as possible but there is a real danger involved. Clear messaging about that, about reducing the length of time involved in visits and about trying to meet family outdoors as much as possible will take a lot of pressure off extended families with regard to their relations and expectations. I welcome what the Government has said about recruitment. Let us not have a strike by public health doctors after all they have done this year. Will the Government please sort out that issue and ensure that existing public health doctors are given the status they deserve, which is consultant status, like all of their colleagues?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	24726	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	336	I join in the thanks to so many, not just those on the front line but also the many people who are making sacrifices to keep others safe. I do not agree with my colleague, Deputy Shortall, when she says that decisions should be made by the whole Parliament. Parliament has a role of scrutiny but the Government has to make decisions. At a time like this, we need to recognise that difference in roles. As we move from the emergency, which is the present phase, with a focus on public health with NPHET's criteria consciously being narrow, we must move to a different approach. We need different structures so that we can break out of those narrow silos in order to effectively manage the critical pathways we all now recognise, namely, testing and tracing, quarantine and effective enforcement, so that people take tests; how we keep vulnerable groups safe; how we manage health facilities and use the wide range of health facilities to the best effect; and vaccine planning and modelling the virus. We need to reach into the private sector too. We are renowned for the data management skills that abound across the private sector. We need to bring that capacity to bear on the challenges we face. We need to more openly balance the genuine costs of some of the choices that we make following risk assessment against the benefits involved. We have been very blunt with the instruments we have adopted to date. We need to become more forensic and weigh those on both sides, particularly as the risks that we see from the virus are decreasing and as vaccines emerge. We need to evolve a different relationship with the communities and sectors we are trying to keep safe. We need to provide more information and have a more principle-based approach to allowing sectors and communities to evolve systems that are seen to be safe, and manage that risk. The truth is that we need to use all of the valves that can reduce risk in different social situations to open up every dimension of life in a safe way, including, in my view, wet pubs. As Deputy Shortall stated, ventilation, temperature testing before people go inside, rapid testing in some sectors, strict protocols on containment and quarantine being applied in workplaces, tightening duration of stay, occupancy levels and distances and the size and make-up of pods are some of the many elements that we can manage to reduce the risk in different sectors rather than have blanket closures. I appeal for that to become a feature. This is a time when we need to pull together. Hopefully, we can evolve that new relationship as we move on.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	337	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak. Any time I have made a contribution, I am reminded that our only precedent for this is Spanish flu. There was a third surge of the Spanish flu in March and April and it will be hard for the country to avoid that in this instance, despite people's best efforts. We need to be mindful of it. The Taoiseach was right in his determination to prioritise the reopening of schools. He and the Minister for Education often do not get the credit for that. Deputy Shortall mentioned the need for ventilation. I have visited a number of schools in my constituency and they are probably the most ventilated buildings in the country. As I stated at our parliamentary party meeting some time ago, if schools were allowed to close on 18 December, since children circulate en masse in these school communities anyway, it would provide families with the opportunity to isolate for a period of up to a week or in excess of a week, with Christmas coming, and perhaps facilitate the opportunity to socialise with grandparents. Please bear that in mind, along with the fact that school communities are exhausted. I will focus on the level of stress involved in managing that environment. For anyone who might be watching this later, I cannot talk about other areas because of the limited time. School communities are at the point of exhaustion. Entire school communities worked right through the summer to get schools open. They put in a phenomenal effort. I have seen that first hand. The Minister has brought a degree of consistency and stability. He achieved in excess of 100,000 tests and his message in recent months has been consistent, which has been helpful. We cannot forget those people who I describe as our brothers and sisters. I refer to those in the hospitality, travel, event management and transport sectors. We are asking them, in the lead-up to Christmas, to survive on Covid payments and one double payment. That must inform everything the Minister says. Wet pubs have not opened since March and pubs that serve food have not opened since September. We have had a surge in that time and the pubs are not responsible for it. I am not an advocate for publicans but I am looking at the potential for another surge. The choice that the Government has to make is whether it allows for people to socialise in a manner that is capable of being policed, observed and regulated or if it, through rules and regulations, drives socialisation and socialising underground into an unregulated, completely unpoliceable environment. If the latter happens, it will lead to a surge over Christmas. That is one of the biggest challenges the Government faces. When we use the term "younger people", it clearly comes from those of us who are older.I pay tribute to that generation who had least to lose from a health perspective from the virus and who made awe-inspiring sacrifices to protect their parents and grandparents, our health workers and all those on the front line and those who are vulnerable. They kept our shelves stacked throughout the period. When we finally see this virus in the rear-view mirror the will be some of the unsung heroes of this period.

It can and does kill. The lethal nature of the virus is nowhere near as serious as it once was. Taking average figures provided by the Central Statistics Office for April, 74 of 1,000 cases tragically led to deaths. In October, five of 1,000 cases tragically led to deaths. Of 1,000 cases in March, 192 led to hospitalisation. Of 1,000 cases in October, 50 led to hospitalisation. This virus is not as lethal as it once was, nor is it as lethal as we once feared. We all remember the horrific scenes from Bergamo and felt that pain at the time. Furthermore, thanks to the huge efforts of so many people, that has not and will not happen here. Despite this, the hammer of lockdown, designed to fight something far more deadly, if still being used now. The facts have changed and our strategy has not. That is not to criticise what we have done until this point. It is to say that now is an opportunity to recalibrate our approach as we look towards the next 12 months.  A question that is separate question from whether lockdowns are still necessary, which I believe they are not, is whether lockdowns potentially doing more harm than good. Cancer referral rates are dramatically down and reports of abuse in the home, be it of a child or a partner, are up. People are struggling with mental health. These are just the other health concerns that we have in society today. That is not to mention the societal or economic damage that is being done as a result of lockdowns. Covid is very serious but this is too narrow a lens to make these tremendous changes and interruptions to our citizens lives and how they go about living, week in and week out, and now month in month out, over the course of 2020. There is an opportunity for the Government to make some changes. The first thing we should do is remove national lockdowns from the five-level strategy for the reasons I have given. I also favour the opening of structured environments because the Government has told us that these open structured environments are safer. I emphasise individual responsibility for people and businesses and we should penalise people accordingly. We should place rings of steel around vulnerable communities. We can do this. The health authorities, local authorities, charities in the homeless sector and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government did this earlier this year and do it still under the new Minister. It can be done for vulnerable communities. We should also keep the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, but merge it into the National Emergency Co-ordination Group. That group is our best practice in this country and we are not using it. It is more inclusive and will lead to better decisions. We should move away from case numbers as a metric for major policy decisions because the correlation, as I have just outlined, is no longer there. We should re-establish the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response. Its Chairman, Deputy McNamara, did great work and we need that layer of accountability back in place.

Many commercial sectors are depending on having a good Christmas, especially retail and hospitality. It is a vital time of year and preparation must begin now if these sectors are to make a success of it. The coming weeks are a time to cherish and one that allows families to spend time together. It is also an important time for religious services. As we enter the new year, many people embark on new fitness regimes and it is a critical sales period for gyms. Many sectors and ways of life have been heavily impacted by the current restrictions, which have taken an enormous toll to date. I have emphasised the need for clarity when speaking on these issues in the past. This week, we need to provide optimism and hope for the self-employed and for those whose employment is effectively on hold. As parliamentarians, we need to bring balance to how this is approached to ensure this is a fair Christmas for businesses. Much media commentary indicates that an uneven playing field may emerge when the current restrictions are lifted. This must be avoided. Our communities are built on mutual respect and helping our neighbours in times of need. I passionately believe in the resolve of the Irish people to drive Covid-19 into the history books where it belongs. To do so, we must place trust in our communities to act responsibly, as the vast majority have done to date. We must trust our businesses to operate as intended and do our best to reopen as much of society as possible.

He talked about women staying in hospital for four or five days with no visitors and how isolating this can be for them. These are women who would normally have had support circles at home. Families and friends would have been calling to see the new baby and lend support and help to the mother and partner. These women, and indeed their partners, are missing out on this emotional and physical support but also the reassurance that family and friends would give. They are alone in some of the most worrying weeks of a new parent’s life. I was contacted by a constituent last week who was greatly concerned that her child who was born in March has yet to receive a developmental check from a public health nurse. The HSE confirmed that these services were shut in March and no date has been given for their reopening. Developmental checks are vital for babies and their mothers. They are a chance to discuss any concern a new mother might have and provide an additional net to prevent those with postnatal depression from falling through the cracks. Without them, there is a real fear for babies for whom serious developmental issues may have been missed. This is a very significant issue. There is fear that mothers will struggle alone because they do not know where to find help and there is fear for the welfare of babies and mothers. We need to see these vital developmental health checks return as soon as possible.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	341	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I pay tribute to all of the health workers for the work they have done over the past nine months, and to the teachers, caretakers, pupils and school secretaries in the education sector.  It is highly likely that this winter we will see the annual trolley crisis come to the fore. Unfortunately, it is also possible we will have the effect of a third wave of Covid. We must do everything we can over Christmas to ensure we do not allow the spread of the virus to increase. With that in mind, what plans does the Minister’s Department have in place to deal with the annual surge in admissions to hospitals which puts pressure on accident and emergency departments?  Capacity needs to be increased. I highlight the case of the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise and Tullamore. Last winter, both hospitals operated at 100% capacity for much of the time, whereas the recommended maximum operational capacity is 85%. What work is being done to increase the capacity in our public hospitals? Will progress made in this area be long-term and additional? We recognise now that we need to expand capacity in our health services. This should not be seen as a temporary issue. We need long-term solutions. On intensive care unit, ICU, capacity, prior to the pandemic Ireland had only six intensive care beds per 100,000 of our population. That is only half the European average. We are a long way behind. Tullamore hospital has four permanent ICU beds and Portlaoise hospital has two such beds. That is six beds for a population in excess of 160,000 people. I am raising this issue in a genuine way because we are skating on thin ice with ICU capacity. Temporary capacity can be put in and the hospital has done that when it has become overwhelmingly busy. These are matters in our health service which must be addressed regardless of whether we face a pandemic.  I welcome the Government’s announcement this week that the pandemic unemployment payment will be extended until the end of March. Workers and businesses in every constituency, including Laois-Offaly, require this certainty to allow them to plan for the future. This announcement is welcome news and provides some peace of mind for the next few months. On the issue of rates, there was a guarantee given that the rates break would continue to the end of December. Unfortunately, businesses are coming out of this year in bad shape. Due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, we need to see this break in rates extended to at least June of next year. I appeal to the Government to clarify that point tonight. Child psychology services have been more or less suspended, as have child speech and language services and child occupational therapy. Parents of autistic children contact me day and night on this issue, as I am sure they contact every other Deputy in the House. We need to get those services back up and running. I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to address this issue.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	342	Those who are trying to underestimate the threat of Covid-19, as Deputy Eoghan Murphy just did, need to explain why there are hospitals in this city turning patients away because they have had Covid outbreaks, irrespective of whether the patients are Covid patients or non-Covid patients. That is with infection rates at a relatively low level. If the rates rise, our hospitals will be overrun, and people who make irresponsible comments will have a lot to answer for. In the insulting amount of time given to discuss the most important issue affecting this country, I am going to make just one point to the Minister. If he wants a Covid strategy that works, he should treat with respect, dignity and support the health workers who are on the front line fighting Covid-19. He is singularly failing to do that. I will not go through in detail the long list of comments made to me, including those of the contact tracers and testers who do not get sick pay and who are on temporary contracts and the nursing staff who have had their pay cut in recent years because of the FEMPI legislation and who have been affected by under-staffing and under-resourcing; I will just speak up for one particular group, the student nurses and midwives. Thousands of them have been working on the front line. The Minister was forced in March and April to accept they were working and should, therefore, be paid and then pulled the rug under that payment leaving them working for nothing again on the front line. I held an online meeting last night with student nurses and midwives. I will allude to some of the comments they made in the short time I have available. They were furious with the Minister over the €50 allowance for accommodation, which most or many of them do not get, and the miserable little travel allowance. They just laughed at the idea that the Minister is protecting their education. One individual said the student nurses are left to their own devices to do front-line work. Another said nurses are doing 12 and 13-hour shifts with no nurse beside them. Yet another said nurses are working in a red zone with Covid patients, covering for staff shortages and people who are sick. I was told student nurses are worried about their family members with underlying conditions. I was also told student nurses had to give up their jobs to do their placements and that this would not be tolerated if they were mostly men. They ask how it is that paramedics, gardaí, those who do military training and apprentices get paid while they are training and student nurses do not although they are actually working on the front line in hospitals. I was told the €50 allowance would not even cover the cost of accommodation and that it would barely cover the cost of a cardboard box. I was also told student nurses and midwives need to pay for parking and that the parking charges for one week are more than they get. Some are paying fees of €3,000 and not getting paid, and mature students are paying €7,000 and not getting paid. The individuals I spoke to say student nurses and midwives fear speaking out and were warned not to speak to the media. I discovered mental health nurses are talking about the fact that their mental health is absolutely in bits because of the situation they are facing. I learned that student nurses are doing multiple academic assignments while filling in for sick staff and understaffed hospitals. They ask how they are even supposed to live or do their shopping. That is how the Minister is treating them. He should pay the student nurses, end the exploitation and treat healthcare workers with respect.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	343	I wish to make three comments - one on schools, one on Christmas and one on workers' rights. On schools, the mental health pressures on the students are mounting. The Minister was very quick to shoot down the suggestion made by the Teachers' Union of Ireland about finishing for Christmas on 18 December. She gave the very strong impression that the Government is not listening, not only to the teachers but also to the students. The Minister needs to see what is happening with mental health and she needs to learn how to read the room. On the question of Christmas, the people of Ireland are wise enough to know there cannot be a fully normal Christmas this year. They should be able to have an enjoyable Christmas without having to fear lockdown again in January. Unfortunately, the Government's continuing failure to put in place a world-class testing and tracing system does increase the risk. The entire population of Liverpool was recently tested for Covid, and 2,000 asymptomatic people were identified and quarantined. Why are we not doing mass testing here in this country?  On workers' rights, if there was a trade union leadership worthy of the name, 2020 would have witnessed a general strike to defend workers' rights and to demand an Irish national health service. The year 2021 must be the year when we beat the virus and see a workers' fight-back for real change on these issues.

Figures come down but community transmission is nowhere near eliminated. The Government listens to the considerable amount of business lobbying and reopens too quickly, and then the number of cases rises again. The way the Government talks, it is like a third wave and third lockdown are inevitable. That would be a nightmare for people. It is completely avoidable if the Government invests in finding, testing, tracing, isolation and supports for people and adopts a strategy of eliminating community transition. From media reports, it seems the plan for next week is to reopen restaurants and then, later in the month, reopen inter-county travel. If that is accurate, it is a recipe for seeding the virus across Dublin for a couple of weeks and then spreading it right across the country. The focus at this time should be on ensuring people can spend time with their families at Christmas. That is what is central. There is public support for it. Despite all one hears in the media and all the business lobbying, there is broad public support for doing what is necessary. An opinion poll published just yesterday indicates that 84% of people believe the Government is either not doing enough or that the action is sufficient. Only 17% say it is too extreme. There is broad public support for doing what is necessary but private profit stands in the way time and again.
#EmerHiggins	unknown-#EmerHiggins-party	unknown-#EmerHiggins-dob	unknown-#EmerHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	345	I am glad we are on track to exit level 5 next week and that we are preparing to reopen gyms. I ask the Minister to allow dance classes with social distancing during level 3 to boost physical and mental health. If one lives on a county border, the opening up of one's county may not offer much hope of seeing one's family. It one lives in Lucan, one is more likely to have family in Leixlip than Lusk. If one lives in Rathcoole, one is more likely to have family in Kill than Killiney, but under county-wide restrictions, even though one may be less than 15 km from one's family, one will not get to see them under level 3. Level 3 is meant to be less restrictive than level 5; that is the point of the graduated levels system, but if one lives on the border of a county, it can end up being more restrictive. If, like me, one lives in Lucan, one can under level 3 travel 40 km north to Skerries and 40 km south to Dalkey but one may not travel 5 km to Leixlip. The Minister should extend the travel radius to allow for travel within 20 km of one's home because that is how to make level 3 the reward it should be for all the families who live close together but who have been separated since September. Families separated by more than 20 km need to know they will be able to spend Christmas together, pull Christmas crackers and tell bad jokes, as they normally do, see their grandchildren, nieces or nephews open their gifts, and uphold just some of their family Christmas traditions. We realise it will not be a traditional Christmas for Ireland but it will be a Christmas that our country has never needed more - a time to come together and value the things that matter to us most as people, as sons and daughters and as parents and grandparents. If ever there were a Christmas that families needed to spend together, this Christmas would be it. Can the Minister tell people living in places such as Lucan and Clondalkin and who want to travel home to spend Christmas with their loved ones that they can plan to do so? This year, more than ever, we all need a little something to look forward to.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	346	We are now in the final week of level-5 restrictions. The figures indicate these restrictions have significantly suppressed the spread of the virus. It has not been suppressed as much as we would have liked but the trajectory of the spread is downward. The hospital and wider healthcare systems have responded effectively to the autumn surge of cases. The various health agencies and healthcare personnel deserve our continued support and encouragement. The leadership shown by the Government and health agencies has been supported by widespread adherence to the guidelines by the public. The restrictions have imposed considerable economic, social and psychological burdens on many people. Lives and livelihoods have been turned upside down.Many small businesses which survived the first lockdown in Spring and early summer will struggle to survive the second hit. Every possible assistance must be made available to these businesses to help them keep going until Easter next year, by which time the roll-out of vaccines will be well under way. We need to be guided by the evidence with regard to how we move out of level 5 restrictions and what regulations should remain in place. From the beginning of the first lockdown in March, supermarkets, food stores, butcher shops, pharmacies and off-licences have remained open. The evidence is fairly strong with regard to these outlets. They have not contributed in any significant way to the spread of the virus. The evidence suggests that the opening of general retail in an ordered and controlled way will not be a major contributory factor in the spread of the virus. A big decision has to be made with regard to restaurants and public houses. Any reopening of the hospitality sector will need to be gradual, measured and have restricted opening hours, but we must give the sector the necessary support so that the businesses can survive. Christmas can still be special for families and everyone. This is a time to watch out for and to be there for each other in different ways. If we follow basic sensible precautions we can get through Christmas and the new year without a large surge of cases in January.

As a former schoolteacher, I never doubted for a moment the capacity of schools to be able to withstand the ravages of Covid-19. Yet, in the back of my head I was concerned that the mass gatherings of children and parents at the school gate every morning would lead to a spread of Covid-19. Great credit is due to our country's schools for the work they have done to minimise the spread of the virus and how they have managed everything thus far in what has been the toughest of all academic years. I wish to speak briefly about the hospitality sector. In the part of the country I come from, social isolation has been practised in pubs for many years. People sit apart on stools. They look down the counters at someone else. They do the crossword and there is little social interaction. This contrasts with the likes of the Berlin D2 bar in Dublin, with people pouring vodka down mouths and running across countertops. That kind of messing has done major damage to the rural model of pub. I hope that when level 5 restrictions are eased in a week or so pubs can be considered. We passed legislation in the House in the summer to allow An Garda Síochána to raid and sanction pubs and take the licence away if the pub is flouting the rules in place. The choice at the moment will be between drinking in a safe controlled environment, where we can trust the publican and manager, versus people on street corners or, as we have seen in parts of Dublin, drinking at the corner of a pub with take-away pints. That it totally unrealistic and dangerous at this time. Families deserve a Christmas. It is good for their mental health and the well-being of the family. I appeal to the Government to do everything possible to ensure a Christmas for families near and far, including for people flying in from abroad. The mantra of "essential travel only" has to change. People should be allowed to travel if they travel with a polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test confirming the person is covid-free at the point of departure and at the point of entry to the country. If the person is not carrying covid, he should be able to go home to the family and spend time with them. Then he may go back to the UK, Dubai or wherever he lives and domicile for the rest of the year. The issue of masses and religious worship needs to be provided for. Spiritual health is important for people. Many people have contacted my office. If we can have 24 people at a funeral, then we can have 24 at Sunday mass. We can have Irish dancing and outdoor events provided all of these activities are subject to social restrictions. There has to be caveats but a great deal can happen. I urge the Government to make the right decisions in the coming 24 or 48 hours.

That is notwithstanding the participation of children in schools and the continuation of certain sectors of the economy. Thankfully, we have the hope of several vaccines for 2021. Without them, I believe the picture would be grim indeed. We know the impact lockdown has had on domestic violence. We know, or are beginning to know, the impact on mental health. We thank every person in Ireland who has so faithfully changed his or her way of living to try to protect the most vulnerable from the virus. I want to highlight two things in my contribution. The first is the real challenge felt by young people. They have been impacted more than we have given them credit for. There is no doubt that lockdown can be easier for people with longer life experience and those who may have a partner at home with whom to share the evenings, though there are many who, working at home all day with their partners and spending the evening with them as well, could be facing genuine challenges of a different kind. We need to acknowledge that as well. Anyway, young people need to be considered as an emerging vulnerable group in the planning for the vaccine distribution. They are suffering a peculiar isolation, whether living with or away from families. We need them to get back out, back to college, back to work and back to working in publicly facing businesses. This is going to be important for them later in life. I appeal for this to be seriously included in the thinking for vaccine planning. The second issue relates to business supports. The range of supports provided this year for businesses by the Government are without precedent. Of course, this is in the context where their activities have had to be constrained by the Government and the Parliament to keep other people safe. We acknowledge that and thank them for it. Next year, 2021, needs to be a new vista for those businesses. They need to be able to open and they need time to plan for it. I remain concerned about the events and exhibition sectors. They are unable to apply for the covid restrictions support scheme. I hope they can be included in the fund for live events established by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin. I hope other businesses that have been nearly closed will be supported as well. Bars, hotels and those in the hospitality sector as a whole have been affected similarly. We have done remarkable work together. People are tired now. I wish to reiterate the comments of my colleagues earlier about the need for new planning and new ways of managing our collective behaviour while we wait for a longer-term solution.

Once again, I wish to offer my condolences to them and their families and loved ones throughout Ireland. Since the pandemic emerged here in March, we knew this winter would be a challenge. The pandemic combined with the winter flu season could have overwhelmed our health service. This was spoken about many times in the Chamber. Thankfully, that is not the case today. The public have made great sacrifices. Credit is due to the efforts of hospital staff, teachers, retail workers, transport workers and all front-line workers involved in Covid-19. They are helping to keep the trend downward. Ireland appears to be managing this second wave better than most of our EU counterparts. As we approach the end of level 5 restrictions, it is appropriate that Dáil Éireann considers the kind of Christmas we want for 2020. We were told that the objective of level 5 was to reduce the incidence of covid to a manageable level to allow us a meaningful Christmas. We all know and accept that this Christmas will be like no other. People have lost their loved ones and the threat of the virus still hangs over us. Yet, there is hope. Three vaccines have been announced. They will be distributed early in the new year. It is clear that the sacrifices made by the people during level 3 and level 5 have worked and are working. We must now move to allow some services to resume. Activities like sports are essential to support mental health and physical well-being. For many people, attending religious services is essential for spiritual well-being. Activities like meeting a friend for a coffee can be essential to emotional well-being. As we exit level 5 it is important that we relax restrictions on activities in a controlled manner. This should apply to gyms, churches, coffee shops, retail, restaurants and gastropubs. However, these businesses need certainty and the Government must confirm arrangements as soon as possible. As the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be aware, I have previously raised my concerns for the many business sectors, including hospitality, tourism, arts and retail. Businesses should reopen based on the size of the premises. That must be considered. We must balance the risk to the public and ensure that any reopening of the economy will be done against the backdrop of best public health advice.

Small business owners are the backbone of rural Ireland in particular. They provide badly needed employment where larger companies believe it is not feasible to do so. They need to be supported and we need to ensure they survive this crisis. It is a matter of survival at this stage because it is a crisis. I received an email from a gentleman at 10.30 p.m. on Sunday. The time it was sent will give an idea of how stressful the situation is and how it is weighing on the minds of people. He wrote to express his frustration about the lack of support for small business. He describes himself as the director of a small business in Kildare. He says he is the administrator, accountant, purchasing manager, salesperson, engineer, order picker and delivery person. The founder of this business was let go from a multinational in recent years. He started his business in 2019 and did not take a wage initially. He invested all his spare cash into the business. Then his business fell off a cliff when the virus arrived. He did not qualify for covid assistance because he was not taking a salary and was last employed in 2018. The Government introduced rates assistance for business but this business did not qualify for it. As a start-up business, the company was renting space from a logistics provider and did not pay rates. When the first lockdown was lifted, the director started paying himself a wage. When level 5 hit Kildare, he applied for the pandemic unemployment payment. He did not qualify because he was not fully unemployed since he was a director of the business. We need to reward our risk-takers rather than punish them. They need a lifeline and they need it fast. It is time to act now before it is too late.Many businesses will not survive this if we do not do something.

We have had the terrible news of six more deaths in the past 24 hours, which means there have been 2,028 deaths during this entire period. It is an absolute tragedy for a huge number of families. There is a severe impact on our lives and our economy. We all have to do what we can to bring the numbers down, particularly as we are looking at opening up. A major emphasis has to be on test, trace and isolate. We all welcome the fact that there has been an increase in the capacity for tracing. We need to maintain this under continuous review. We are talking about opening up and that is necessary but we need to talk about outbreaks and how we deal with them. That is done by chasing down this horrible virus. We have had a huge issue in respect of nursing homes and we have all heard of particular outbreaks in the past while that have got us worried when we remember what happened in March, April and May. I welcome what I have been told by the HSE regarding its improved strategies and line management in dealing with all these issues. We need to ensure that this happens and that all the necessary supports are provided to ensure our elderly citizens are looked after properly at this time. I want to raise the issue of public health protocols in congregated settings. In fairness to the Minister of State, she has already indicated to me that this is something that needs to be looked at. It was brought to my attention that there was an outbreak at St. John of God's in Drumcar in and around 14 October last. This was in a congregated setting. It was like a residential campus. There were three residents and approximately 14 staff. One resident became sick with Covid-19 but, on public health advice, all of those in the facility were not considered a close contact. In fairness, the staff drew attention to the fact it was very likely that an asymptomatic member of staff had brought Covid-19 in. That was their belief. Screen testing was not happening in this congregated setting and, even following the outbreak in question, full testing was not done. A number of staff did not feel particularly well over two periods. They went to their own doctors to get tested and approximately nine of them had Covid-19. This is something we need to look at. I have also heard that in September or October there was an outbreak at the Crosslanes psychiatric unit in Drogheda. As a result of this outbreak, the provision of the many mental health services on offer there, which are very necessary, particularly at this time, was almost brought to a halt. We need to look at all these health settings and at other congregated settings from the point of view of screening. The question is whether the latter is done by using the PCR capacity that exists. We also have to look at the possibility of carrying out rapid antigen tests, possibly alongside PCR testing, which is still seen as the gold standard. This is what we have to do until we get to that almost promised land when we have a vaccine and can move to a more normal life.

Covid continues to dominate the daily lives of everyone, not only here in Ireland but worldwide. I welcome the fact there are positive signs that a successful vaccine is not too far away. Everyone’s life has been affected and put on hold during the pandemic. Many people have paid the ultimate price. We must learn from this pandemic. We must prepare ourselves for the future pandemic because there is no doubt we will be faced with this at some stage in the future. I suspect that life will not go back to normal as it was before. Rather, we will have to deal with a new normal. It is for this reason that we must plan now. The people cannot face another serious lockdown and the hardship to which it gives rise. We must make our public buildings, schools, hospitals, libraries, care homes and all other places where people can meet and congregate as safe as possible from viruses like Covid. How do we do this? We must examine that matter now and proposals must be put forward. As I have stated on previous occasions, I support the efforts of this Government and the way it has handled the pandemic. It is not a time for playing petty political games like those have seen in other jurisdictions, nor is it a time for scaremongering. When we compare the numbers of deaths and hospitalisations now with those in the first wave, what is encouraging is that it is clear progress has been made in the treatment of Covid. The next challenge we face is the roll-out of a vaccine. I am pleased that the Government has appointed Dundalk man Professor Brian MacCraith to chair the vaccine task force, which will be vital in the context of getting the country back up and running. It is important that the public is made aware of all aspects of the roll-out of the vaccine. In order for this to be successful, we need the public to buy into it. I have full confidence in Professor MacCraith and his team to deliver. I agree with Professor MacCraith that urgency and certainty are the keys to a successful roll-out. We need the roll-out to happen quickly, with the most vulnerable and the front-line workers to be first in line. I welcome the fact that a vaccine is now imminent, that hospital numbers and deaths have not reached the levels seen during the first wave and that we have a task force in place to develop a roll-out strategy. Society in general has made huge sacrifices during this past seven months and we must now do everything in our power to ensure that we, as elected representatives, make the right choices moving forward so that the lives of the people are brought back to normal.

I was concerned to hear the Minister for Health say that there were 231 contact tracers mid-September, at a time when we had 255 cases daily. At that time, I questioned the Tánaiste and he informed us that there were 400 contact tracers and that we would have to bring in the Army should we need any more. Last week, the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, called for the Army to be brought in and to allow those in other essential services get back to their day jobs, such as providing vital speech therapy services and so on. I am glad we now have nigh on 700 contract tracers with the number of cases standing at 255 per day. I hope the Government understands that it is better to have a couple of thousand contact tracers than it is to have 350,000 people drawing the PUP because of the need to go to level 5 as a result of an ineffective testing and tracing system. Lockdown restrictions should not be what we need to sort out our testing and tracing. I ask the Government to bear in mind that the purpose of these level 5 restrictions was to increase bed capacity, ICU capacity and ensure that testing and tracing capacity was put in place to keep us out of lockdown. Something the WHO totally disagrees with is the lockdown. While the advice of NPHET must be taken on board, we must have regard also for the many medical and science professionals who disagree with its view and request a balanced approach to other health services, whose needs are equally great. We must take their advice on board also. I will mention a few of those services: our mental health services are overwhelmed, our disability services are overwhelmed, our cancer screening services are non-existent. Failing to recognise their needs, will far outweigh the effects of Covid in the long run. There is clear evidence that a new approach is required. That approach must encompass more than the element of medical opinion that we have followed to date. I wish the Government appreciated and had equal regard for people's general health as well as for their livelihoods. I hope this will be forthcoming without delay.

This means that 97% of all the countries in the world have chosen strategies that are less restricted than Ireland. Ireland is a significant outlier in international terms and this has given rise to a massive human cost.The WHO has stated that lockdowns should only be used when there is so much pressure on a health service that it will be overwhelmed. We have not been in such a situation in this wave. When measured purely on the basis of Covid numbers, Ireland has done comparatively well. If all of life's other indicators are measured, though, Ireland has done shockingly poorly. As a result of the Government's decisions, there have been 150,000 missed cancer appointments, 200,000 women are on waiting lists for cancer screening and there are widespread diagnosis and treatment delays for stroke, heart disease and mental health. Today, 480 people were diagnosed with cancer, 24 people died from cancer and 27 people died from heart disease or strokes. Due to Government restrictions, these health areas have not had the necessary resources given to them. Regarding mental health, it is a poor situation that we do not yet have the current suicide figures. These figures are generated from coroner's reports, which tend to be made six months to a year after a suicide has happened. When I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health, he admitted to me that suicide prevention organisations had advised him that there had been a recent increase in suicides. More than 500,000 Irish people are out of work, more than 3,000 SMEs have closed for good and there has been a 25% increase in child poverty, which is directly related to future mortality and morbidity rates. We in Aontú are not saying that there is no need for restrictions. There is a need, but the current restrictions are disproportionate and having a serious and negative effect on lives. We called for the Government to focus on protecting the most vulnerable. More than half of those who have died from Covid were in nursing homes. Nursing homes were not properly protected. That was the first line on which the Government needed to focus. The second was ICU and ensuring that we had the necessary ICU capacity to deal with the pandemic. Precious little of the €18 billion announced in the previous budget went into the front line of ICU and extra hospital beds. We asked the Government to focus on testing at airports, but there is still none. Let no one be fooled, in that Irish people in their tens of thousands will travel home for Christmas. People from other countries who are working in Ireland will travel to those countries for Christmas. If we do not get our testing to ensure that all of this can happen safely, we will suffer significantly in the new year.

I welcome the opportunity to speak about Covid and I acknowledge the considerable effort made in recent weeks to reduce the numbers since the autumn. I commend the Government, but also health workers, the HSE, other public health bodies and NPHET, on their work. Covid has had a major economic cost, but as other Deputies have mentioned, there are considerable social and non-Covid health costs as well that we must focus on addressing early in the new year. We need a community-based mental health programme that will attract people who may not have accessed mental health services previously. We need to address screening delays. We need to consider other public services that have been delayed, for example, driver testing. Public services that required contacts between people during the first lockdown are showing significant delays and causing major difficulties. We must start taking our public health services seriously. Public health has been the Cinderella of the Irish health services. Now is the chance to invest properly in it so that, as Deputy Fitzpatrick stated, we will be ready if another pandemic arises, but also if we are to deal with issues of obesity and the like that will have a significant impact on the nation's health. Some issues must be addressed in the next few weeks. We need clarity and consistency in every part of the country about visits to nursing homes. The rules are different depending on the region and are causing people stress. Where access to maternity hospitals is concerned, particularly for fathers, the rules also differ from hospital to hospital. We need consistency. We must focus on younger people, including teenagers, and get them back to their sporting activities, dance classes and singing classes, which help them. If young people can be in school in a structured and controlled environment, surely they can attend a dance or singing class in a structured and controlled environment. The responsibility is on the class organiser. Inevitably, there will be a great deal of focus on the decisions taken in the coming days. I wish our colleagues in government well. They will take their decisions with safety in mind, but they need to consider all options. The largest source of Covid outbreaks are private houses. One dissuades people from visiting private houses by providing other options, for example, opening all pubs. Where proper controls are in place, the distinction between wet and dry pubs can be reviewed as a way of reducing the amount of activity in private houses. There must be co-ordination on the island. There cannot be one law in Blacklion and another in Belcoo even though they are effectively the same town. Consistency must be brought not just to the Border, but to borders between counties. People are being told that they cannot travel between counties, but if they live a mile from a county border like I do, people going about their daily business will travel to Ballina from County Sligo, from Castlerea to Ballyhaunis and from Ballindine and Milltown. During the first lockdown, there was provision for business to be done across county borders by people who lived there. The same provision should be made for the coming weeks. There needs to be clear information as soon as the announcement is made. We cannot be scrambling for information and trying to respond. There should be one spot where everyone can go to see the announcement. I wish to signal a concern about all of the calls for 24-7 shopping and retail. We must think about the workers. The calls sound good, but retail workers have had a tough year. They are also on the front line and they, their arrangements and their families should be considered in the coming weeks.

We owe our relative success to our front-line workers and the Irish people. I recognise the leadership and decision making - initially of the caretaker Government and then the new Government - that sought to protect the vulnerable primarily and assist the economy by means of many expensive but worthwhile interventions in a wide and varied number of sectors and services, be they business, cultural, sporting or community-based. We have become more accustomed to the basic defences against the virus, for example, good personal hygiene habits and etiquette, while commerce has improved its offerings with home working and online trading, to name but a few measures. Many sectors have been trusted previously and we are led to believe they will be trusted again. These include hairdressers, barbers, non-essential services or retail offerings and so forth. They and their customers can and will live and trade, not in spite or fear of Covid, but with it. They will do this because they have to, and doing so is essential if they and we are to have a future. We need to consider extending that trust, loyalty and understanding to other sectors that are willing to reciprocate by showing that they, too, can live and trade with Covid. Leadership is about affording trust and earning loyalty, through compromise if necessary. The trust afforded to children, staff and management in schools has been repaid by the bucketful. It has been the shining light in this dark pandemic, together with our far greater appreciation of our families, surroundings and communities. The success of schools was based on consultation and planning. I would ask for, or even demand at this stage, an assurance that the Government is considering the possibilities that would allow the hospitality sector to reopen and discussing those not at, to or for the sector, but with it in order to agree new guidelines or, if necessary, new laws. The sector, its staff and their families want and expect a meaningful Christmas, too. By agreeing these protocols, the Government would give society a far greater ownership of the solutions. We will need the hospitality sector when we seek to repay the billions of euro that, thankfully, we have been able to dish out in recent months. Shut the sector out now and we shut out a large slice of the cake needed to repay that money. People in the sector know, understand and appreciate what the consequences will be for those who do not adhere to the guidelines and relevant laws - closure. That is justice in a democracy during a pandemic to which we have grown accustomed. If someone breaks the law, he or she suffers the consequences. God knows, I should know that. If we are to have a meaningful Christmas that all of society can share and own, let us ensure that it ticks every box so that society buys into it, the economy is able for it , we have the spiritual and mental well-being to appreciate the offerings available to us, and can relish the opportunities presented by Christmas even at this dark time.

It started out as a bright new decade, but was destroyed by this pandemic. I feel for what many business owners across the constituency of Cork East, whom I am paid to represent as a new Deputy in the House, have gone through throughout the year. I concur with some of the comments made by Deputy Cowen on the rounds of applause. Businesses in constituencies throughout the country cannot walk into a bank or Revenue and give them a round of applause. They need the support of the State in the upcoming months when we finally get through the worst part of this pandemic. I am sincerely hopeful that through the fantastic efforts made by scientists throughout the world we will have an effective vaccine in the very near future and I hope the Government can plan for that being put in place swiftly so society throughout Ireland can go back to normal as soon as possible. However, I have to state that I have several concerns about our current strategy. It has been very difficult for many backbench Deputies who are supporting the Government throughout the past number of months to put ideas forward to NPHET and Ministers. I understand that Ministers who are working with NPHET are in a difficult position as they try to implement the best possible policy to protect our population from the spread of Covid. I am concerned about the impact it is having on the hospitality sector and students in higher education. As I said, I am the youngest Deputy in the House. The stress and strain that has been put on students throughout the country has been enormous. In the next number of months I want the Government to state whether plans will be put in place to allow students about to enter and currently in university to plan to be able to return to college lectures and tutorials. An integrated learning system will be critical in the next six months if we are serious about allowing students a proper experience of university. So much has been taken away from them. They are in constant communication with me. A lot of them are hurting and are very angry and frustrated. They have been put in a position, through no fault of their own or the Government, of having to deal with what is in front of them. It is an enormous task for anybody, never mind somebody who is starting out in his or her life for the first time on his or her own, to have to deal with this problem and be stuck at home when he or she is supposed to be out enjoying life. I am quite conscious of that issue. It is critical. I know the Minister will do his best, as he always does, to feed that message back to the Government. I also want to talk about the effects the pandemic is having on the hospitality sector. Over 20,000 jobs in County Cork depend on hospitality. NPHET is kidding itself if it is under the impression that people will not gather in each others homes. That is reason enough to examine the possibility of allowing people to use the services that our hotels provide, including dining and accommodation, without having too much of the burden of restrictions over the Christmas period. I am working alongside many hoteliers in my constituency and I trust them, as I trust our restaurateurs and publicans, to do the right thing over the next number of months. The Government and NPHET should do the very same.

I want to acknowledge the extraordinary effort and role played by Irish people over the past seven months, including front-line staff in our hospitals, retail workers and principals and teachers in our schools who have done and continue to do a fantastic job every day. The restrictions and lockdowns have had serious implications in terms of people's health. Cancer screening and treatment has been almost non-existent. I have had first-hand experience of trying to fight for people who have cancer to get them transferred to hospital for timely treatment. As I have said all along, I sincerely hope that the cure does not become worse than the disease. We need to be very careful about that because lives are being lost. We will, unfortunately, see the effects of this over the next number of months. Businesses in my constituency of Laois and Offaly have also had to endure a severe and unwarranted series of extra lockdown measures that have cost the local economy dearly. Unfortunately, we have also seen the re-emergence of the cutthroat practices associated with vulture funds which are now running riot. I highlighted this issue last week when I noted that vulture funds are engaging in the forced sale of a significant number of farms. The picture that is emerging from around the country is horrendous. It is of deep concern to many farmers who are trying their level best to engage with lenders around debt management and repayment arrangements. As I understand it, personal insolvency practitioners have attempted to sound the alarm about the vicious and unsympathetic approach that is being adopted by various vulture funds. These vulture funds have to be reined in. There are also credible reports that the sale of some farms is being forced through without any prior notice being given. All of this demonstrates that while most people are trying to live with Covid, some organisations seek to thrive from the misery it has created. I also want to point out that the denial of physical access to mass and religious services has been very upsetting. The treatment of Fr. Hughes, who was threatened with prosecution, was nothing short of scandalous and reminiscent of penal times.

The emergency department had 52 patients on trolleys yesterday, with an additional ten trolleys in wards. The overcrowding in the accident and emergency department has been an issue for years and the department has been the worst in the country. It is currently finding it impossible to operate social distancing. The HIQA regulator has stated he will be unable to comply with restrictions due to the current overcrowding in the department. This is no reflection on the staff or nursing care in our hospitals. This type of investment means that in January 98 beds will have been opened and there will be 150 extra staff in hospital. I want that accountability from management. When I was elected I said this on my first day in the House. I am repeating now that I want accountability from management.

I call on the Government to give the hospitality sector a chance and trust it in the coming days. Many businesses opened for only a couple of weeks in September. People all around us have been isolated in rural places. They have not met anybody or been to a local pub for almost six months. That is being reflected in the rate of depression and suicide in my neck of the woods in recent times. I call on the Government to trust publicans, who work in the most regulated sector and have been best placed to sell alcohol over the years. The same amount of alcohol, if not more, has been sold this year compared to any other year. It is unfair for Dr. Holohan to have said a couple of weeks ago that there will be no drinking in pubs this Christmas. He is not the Minister or Tánaiste.

As I have said on numerous occasions, I do not want them to be praised. I know they are not looking for praise. I want them to be paid. Wage agreements are in place for our nurses. Catering staff who have worked in our hospitals have not received a pay increase in 13 years. If I am wrong about that, I would like to be corrected and told that I am wrong. Unfortunately, I am correct. That situation is wrong. The Government has made many mistakes in how it handled this crisis. I supported it in every way when it was doing something right. I will outline an example of absolute stupidity. When I and others came to the House and asked for marts to be opened so that farmers could go around a ring and bid for cattle, the answer was no. Instead, they are sitting on the bonnets of motor cars staring into computers to look at animals.That is a far more unsafe practice than if they were allowed around the rings, where the excellent mart managers would take care of them and ensure that social distancing would apply.  People have put their shoulders to the wheel, and I am deeply grateful to them for that, in trying to save and protect lives, which they have done. Nevertheless, the hospitality sector has been sold down the swanny. I spoke to people earlier who told me they will not now open their pubs because of the way the Government has treated them. It is really unfair to pick on one sector of society. Despite the Government's best efforts, it has failed to produce any evidence of a link between people consuming alcohol in public houses and the spread of the virus. It tried to prove it but it failed.

I will stick to my time, which will preclude me from saying many things. The Taoiseach spoke about how there was no handbook to guide the Government at the beginning of the pandemic, but common sense would have guided anybody at the time to protect the nursing homes, direct provision, those working in meat plants and so on. That is what common sense would dictate. At this point, common sense dictates that we look at those most needing our assistance, those who are saving the economy millions of euro, namely, carers, as the Minister of State knows better than I do. There is absolutely no respite and I do not see it at the top of anybody's list. I acknowledge that the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Butler, have done their best in respect of day centres and respite, but it is simply not adequate to the need. It seems the Government is premising its solution on the basis that when somebody physically or mentally has a breakdown, the service will kick in to give respite. That is totally unacceptable. Any measure of our economy should be how we treasure those who save the State a fortune, and they are mostly women. There are false arguments about NPHET all the time. There was the spin from the Tánaiste, which did very well, the spin from the Taoiseach, which did not do as well, the undermining of NPHET and all the false messages going out. There was the distinction between wet and dry pubs, which was absurd from day one and a waste of Garda time, with gardaí going in to see who was eating a substantial meal. There were the draconian measures we did not need, described as such by the Policing Authority. The Garda told the Government it did not need any more powers as it had plenty. The Policing Authority complimented the Garda and, more important, the vast majority of the people who were - I forget the exact words - surprisingly compliant. That is how we have reduced our numbers. It is worth remembering that all our actions were prefaced, in the first instance, on a very bad health system, where the panicked reaction suggested that the health system would be overwhelmed because we had run it down for so long. Then there was the daft arrangement with the private hospitals where we paid them to remain empty while people were going under at home, with no day centre and no respite. It is mind-boggling. I will use my remaining time as a voice to say to Deputy Rabbitte, at some level as a woman and a female Minister of State, let us do something different here to provide respite. Let us not wait for the breakdown. Let us do it positively. Carers are doing us a marvellous service. I am ashamed and embarrassed. I recently got a response to a parliamentary question but did not have the courage to give it to the person affected to say there was no respite. This is somebody who is up day and night, although I will not go into the details. We do not need more anecdotes; we need action.

We can never forget about the grief of those who have lost a loved one, who never got a chance to say goodbye and, in some cases, could not attend a funeral. There has also been the everyday pain of people going to a window of a nursing home, just to try to be present. We need some regime, however strict, to allow at least some visits. I hate to say it but the budget let down family carers, worn out behind their own front doors. We need further support immediately. There are Covid survivors, often thought of as the lucky ones, who have been struck down by post-viral fatigue, while lives have been circumscribed, sometimes badly. We need, in parallel, to fund research and to try to find therapies and treatments for these people. There are young people over the age of 18 who are not working or in college and are pursuing online courses in bedrooms that have become virtual prisons. We need to find ways to allow their return to campus for blended learning, even on a staggered basis. Any business that, for the best public health reasons, will not be allowed to reopen needs a special package of supports immediately. Businesses, often one or two-person operations, that do not operate from a specific premises cannot access business supports because they are tied to premises. We need to look again at that group. We should consider setting up a Dáil committee, similar to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, on the vaccination process from start to finish. I refer to the plans, the processes, the implementation of decisions taken by public health experts, the national and local approach, the follow-up and the follow-through, the collection of information, the staff, the buildings and their location, the transport, the sourcing of what I call the tools of the trade, the cost, the public information provision, the human factors and all the other logistics. All this and more will add up to probably the most important work the Government will undertake. A special Dáil committee would provide proper accountability, good co-operation and reassurance to people. In regard to Christmas, people want simple, clear messages. To be honest, I do not want to hear about bringing home one's own plates or cutlery or putting grandpa near an open window. If Covid does not get him, the flu will. We need straightforward messages about the number of households in total that someone can meet up with at Christmas, the exact requirements for those travelling from abroad and the simple messages of washing hands, masking up and social distancing. Moreover, while there must be proper ventilation, mind grandpa.

We know we will have to live with Covid-19 but we cannot live with lockdowns, which threaten our economy. We have to consider opening the country and deal with testing, tracing and outbreak management. We cannot afford another lockdown. I refer in particular to the move from level 5 to level 3. This would still mean that hotels could not accept visitors from outside their county, restaurants could serve only at a limited capacity and wet pubs could not open. We need to find a way of easing county travel restrictions and allowing indoor dining in the very safe environments of hotels and restaurants. These establishments have done all they can to protect their customers. Most especially in these vital weeks in the lead-up to Christmas, we must ensure we do all we can to protect lives and also to provide information for businesses, people working in the arts, gyms, sports clubs, hairdressers and barbers. Christmas will be four weeks away on Friday and everyone is wondering what will happen. I accept we are taking things day by day, but if we could get more information, it would be so important. The lockdown has taken its toll in many ways, in particular on mental health and people who are waiting for hospital appointments. I have contacted the Minister of State about disability and respite services. She has given me her full support and I thank her for that. The imminent arrival of an effective, low-cost vaccine could be a game changer and we should ensure we have all we need to enable the most vulnerable people to get the vaccine. That is the number one issue. Everyone who wants the vaccine should be able to access it. Another issue we need to discuss is the driver licence test backlog, which affects so many. This is not just a road safety issue but also a financial one.Drivers who do not have their driving tests in hand due to delays may face up to €600 extra in insurance costs. I was contacted this week by a constituent who was due to sit his theory test last Friday. It was cancelled and rescheduled for some time in February, four months from now. He lives in a rural part of County Carlow without public transport. His situation is not unique. I am told that some 30,000 drivers could be impacted by the delays, as I am sure the Minister for Transport is aware. It is an issue that must be addressed. Each week, Deputies rise in the Chamber to point to cases where this is impacting people. Being certified is important for drivers not only because it saves them money but also because driving may be their means of accessing work. People who do not have a licence and do not have access to public transport cannot get to work. I have spoken to the Minister about this issue before. We need to find a solution for the people in that situation. I want to raise the issue of home visits. With Christmas around the corner, people are asking me what will happen in this regard. There are vulnerable people who need to know that someone can come to see them, whether on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day or shortly thereafter. They do not want to be left alone at Christmas, which has always been associated with visitors and family time. I accept that we must be careful about visitor numbers and I am sure there will be restrictions in that regard. However, it is important that people are allowed to visit family members and also neighbours and friends, including older people, to ensure they do not feel alone. Christmas is a very special time for the people of Ireland. We love Christmas, it is part of our heritage and we enjoy celebrating it with family. This year, Christmas is more special than it ever was before. All of us in this House have a responsibility for our own actions and a duty of care to follow the guidelines, give people as much information as possible and help as many people as we can. It is important to state that the people have been excellent throughout this time. As I have said before, this has been a really hard year and one we will never forget. Front-line workers and workers in all sectors have been very good. It is important that we make this Christmas special and see what we can do be a bit more lenient and allow people to do a little extra. I acknowledge the importance of keeping people safe and working within the NPHET guidelines. We do not want to go into another lockdown after Christmas. However, it is also important that we do what we can for people at Christmas. I thank the Minister of State for listening to the points we have raised. Covid has changed all our lives. I was speaking to a friend recently who has a family member who contracted the virus. Life is precious and we have to make the best of it and make sure we do the best we can for everyone.

I have a script to hand but I always choose, in responding to debates, to address the issues raised by the Deputies who are still in the Chamber. That is how I operate. Lest I forget, there is one point I would like to make before responding to the points raised. As we move to level 3 and open up the economy, if that is what happens, businesses might consider setting aside an hour or two for older people and people who are vulnerable to do their shopping. It might be for two hours on a Sunday morning, for example, in the weeks leading up to Christmas. It would be a very kind and thoughtful thing to do. I am not part of the team that meets with NPHET and, as such, anything I say does not carry as much weight as statements by the Minister for Health. The last time I was in the House for a debate on the Covid situation, we discussed the number of people who were deployed to contact and tracing, an issue that was raised again by a number of Deputies this evening. At the end of September, there were 866 people involved in swabbing and contact tracing. Today, there are 1,700 staff involved in that effort. It is important to note the breakdown of that figure. In regard to contact tracing, 530 staff have been newly recruited to that work and another 70 will start next week. We currently have 1,000 people involved in swabbing, which includes 440 newly recruited personnel. The recruitment drive that happened is showing results. I will deal now with an issue that was raised which relates to my brief of disability services, namely, the situation of family carers. The hurt, frustration and anxiety they have been enduring since March is unimaginable for any of us unless we are in their shoes. As Deputy Connolly pointed out, many have had no access to respite. I am working on that issue. We have designated day services for persons with disabilities as an essential service and we intend to do the same for respite care. I am just waiting on the go-ahead to ensure those services, as opposed to being deemed emergency care, will be opened up in the same way that they were in the past. I acknowledge and pay tribute to family carers. When we talk about front-line workers in various services, we must include family carers in that bracket. Deputy Ó Murchú queried whether swabbing was taking place in a particular organisation in his constituency. I probably read the same article the Deputy did and I cannot answer his question this evening. In regard to the facility in Drumcar, it is important that I take this opportunity to pay my sympathies to the family of the person who died there due to Covid. I do so in the same way that I would pass my sympathies to anybody who has lost a loved one. I will look at the issue of whether people living in residential settings - not just nursing homes but also day houses and respite houses - have the protection of a programme of continual swabbing. There seems to have been a gap in this regard and it is something I am examining. My colleague, Deputy Calleary, referred to the importance, as we begin to open up our society again, of focusing on activities for young people. As a former spokesperson for children and youth affairs, I agree that we must look at how we can enable children to access dance classes, sports and so on. We need to allow them to reintegrate back into their communities and move on with their lives. The Deputy's point about the importance of social interaction for well-being is very valid. I have two young children who are taught in pods in their school. We should be thinking about using pods on the sports field. In fact, we are doing that one night a week in our local GAA club. Deputy Cowen referred to the need for trust. As we go forward into whatever level we move to next - it looks like it will be level 3 - we must ensure that people have trust in our business community, cultural community, sporting community and communities at large. That is necessary if we are to ensure that some normality will be returned. Finally, it would be wrong of me not to mention borders in the context of whatever restrictions may apply in the future. I live in Portumna, which is on the border with County Tipperary. A move to level 3 would mean that I could not go across the bridge and that people in Portland could not come into Portumna to shop. We need to look at the wider question of how we can allow communities to live.

Will he also share any information he has on the level of recovery in commencements and completions since the second quarter report earlier this year?
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	371	I thank the Deputy for his question. Increasing the supply of housing, particularly social and affordable housing, is a priority for me and for the Government. The programme for Government contains a commitment in respect of increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000 units, with an emphasis on new builds. I will elaborate on that presently. In budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of €3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.This is the largest budget allocation for housing in the history of the State. This investment will ensure that the housing needs of over 28,500 households are met. The available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing. However, a major focus of this investment relates to the delivery of new-build homes, with an overall target of 9,500 such homes. Increased build targets will see increased local authority construction activity on local authority land. That is what the Government wants to see. My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on social housing delivery activity. These quarterly figures are published on the statistics page of the Department's website. In addition to the statistical overview of activity in each local authority area, a detailed social housing construction status report is published which provides scheme level detail on new-build activity. The most recent publication covers the period to the end of quarter 2 of this year. The reports have been delayed due to Covid-19 as we prioritised the response on homelessness and housing delivery. However, we are currently collating this information. The statistical returns for the construction status report for quarter 3 will be completed in the coming week, certainly well in advance of the end of the year. I have asked for that to be expedited. There has been some pick-up in activity in the quarter 3. When the Deputy has finished, I will update him on that.

Many of us were surprised at the size of the impact. The Minister will know, from the quarter 2 report, that only 9% of new builds had been delivered on track and that figure increases to 12% when one adds new builds and acquisitions. I do not cite those figures to criticise the Department because, in fairness, it was quick to ensure social housing construction sites opened before private sites. I also acknowledge that the Minister secured social housing as a priority infrastructure in the second round. There is a concern that Covid-19 is not the only reason for the slowdown this year. We have been hearing from elected members in a number of urban councils that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's value-for-money exercise for projects above €20 million is also having a negative impact. That is not the Minister's Department but my concern is that, notwithstanding Covid, we would have been behind at any rate. Can the Minister give us any information on where we are with the recovery? In particular, will he address the concern expressed about the value-for-money exercise?

We are all aware of the reason delivery stood at only 9% at the end of quarter 2. I was criticised by the Deputy in that regard but that is fair enough. A housing delivery task force comprised of all the stakeholders - the housing delivery co-ordination office, local authorities and approved housing bodies - meets regularly and I will have the report in the next couple of weeks. I am focusing on quarter 4 completions. Given the target of delivering more than 11,000 completions, it is important that we do not fall further behind. For this reason, the Government agreed with my request to keep construction and all ancillary services open during the current level 5 restrictions. We should reach or exceed 70% of the target by the end of the year. As the Deputy will be aware, there is a big push in quarter 4 and that is what I am looking at currently.

However, I am concerned that Covid is not solely responsible for the lag and the value-for-money exercise is also responsible. I ask the Minister to examine that issue with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Will he add the 30% that may not be delivered this year to the 2021 target to ensure the net position by the end of 2021 will be the same as it would otherwise have been under the Rebuilding Ireland targets?

I am giving the Deputy the information to the best of my knowledge. Obviously, a large number of people are doing intense work to ensure we catch up. I visited a number of the sites in question. Yesterday, for example, I was on the site on the Enniskerry Road in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown which shut down, even though it was a public site, and it took ten weeks to get it up and running to full capacity. We should remember that a productivity on a number of those sites decreased before the official shutdown in March because people were moving off site. I will make an assessment of the housing completion figures when we get to the end of the year. We have set a very exacting target for next year of 12,750 completions, of which 9,500 will be new builds. Leasing will form part of that, as will a move away from acquisition. Allowing for only 800 acquisitions next year, we need that flexibility for different types of housing, such as adapted housing and larger houses. I will report progress to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and to Deputies in the House. We are projecting completions to exceed 70% of the target for the year. We will assess housing completions by the end of the year and see how we are doing.

The Minister will be aware that the issue of co-living has been raised regularly in these Houses. We spoke on a motion on this issue recently. We very much welcome the statement on co-living the Minister reportedly made yesterday. Perhaps he is in a position to outline his stance and what effect it will have.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	381	I thank Deputy Ó Ríordáin. I am pleased to be given the opportunity to make an official statement to the House. I have been clear in previous debates in my intention to review the provisions on shared accommodation or, as it is more widely known, "co-living", as set out in section 5.0 of Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities, which were published in 2018. Paragraph 5.24 of the guidance committed the Department to monitor the provision of shared accommodation, with a view to issuing further technical updates of the sustainable urban housing guidelines document with regard to co-living, given the relatively new nature of this form of accommodation. The original guidelines provided for a two-year review. I stated in the Dáil and the convention centre that I would review co-living development. I asked my officials to do so and they completed a report, which I have carefully considered, having regard to the broader context of what I want the country to deliver, namely, sustainable, good, affordable housing, both public and private. Further to the report, my preferred approach is to update the 2018 design standards for new apartments guidelines for planning authorities to restrict future commercial co-living development with a specific planning policy requirement, SPPR, for a presumption against grant of permissions for co-living shared accommodation. Yesterday, I issued a circular advising local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the Office of the Planning Regulator of this and noting, in particular, the scale and location of co-living developments permitted and proposed to date, the need for a local authority-led evidence-based approach to guide any further provision, and the potential impact on land values. All of this is set out in the report I published yesterday, which is available to everyone. Effectively, in the guidelines I have set out on co-living, the presumption in respect of any new developments is refusal. It is a de facto ban.

His statements on this matter in opposition had been categorical and he has delivered on them as Minister. This could be an example of the Opposition and Government working effectively together. Is it the view of the Minister's officials that this decision will need to be underpinned by legislation in due course? Is there a suggestion it might be open to challenge? What will happen to planning applications that are currently being adjudicated by An Bord Pleanála? Applications for such developments in the south inner city and in Donaghmede in my constituency are currently under consideration.The Minister's instruction has gone to An Bord Pleanála. Does his order have an effect on adjudications An Bord Pleanála may currently be making on applications?

I cannot change that because they were lodged at the time when the 2018 guidelines pertained. Existing permissions stand. It is important Deputies know that one of the reasons I looked at this in a lot of detail is that 14 permissions were granted to deliver approximately 2,100 units of this type and not one of them has been delivered. I was particularly concerned about the impact that was going to have, or was having, on land cost and values and whether some of these applications and permissions were simply about inflating the value of a particular piece of ground. Effectively, the current applications will move through the system and for new applications there is a presumption of a of a refusal because the guidance is that there be a refusal. I cannot make it retrospective, as the Deputy knows. The Government's position on co-living is clear: it is not a tenure of housing we prefer or that I, as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, want to see.

I have a quick question. If a number of planning applications were to be successful, if An Bord Pleanála were to rule that co-living, because of the previous guidelines, should be accepted in these cases, what measures does the Minister think would be within his powers to move against that? Do we just have to accept that these came and were given permission under previous guidelines and that is just the way it is or is there some kind of regulation he could bring in to monitor and have some kind of oversight over that type of accommodation? It is one thing to rule out everything that will happen from now on but to try to oversee the building standards that currently exist is another. As such, is there some way we can ensure that if something does get permission we are not behind the curve, that we are preparing for that eventuality? Is that something the Minister has thought about, is it something his officials are considering? I ask because we could have a situation where, notwithstanding the Minister's position on this, we have a number of co-living apartments or dwellings on stream in a very short period.

I said I would carry out a review, which I did. I said I would base any decision I made on clear research and the data I had, which I have done. I have published the report for all to see. It outlines four different options and only one of those options was to do what I have done. Government has made a very clear decision here, through me as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that this type of development is not what we want to see. I have effectively banned these developments and there is a presumption of a refusal for any new applications that come in. It does not have any effect retrospectively for permissions that have been granted. The Deputy mentioned building standards and other elements. The building standards will apply in each local authority area. It is interesting to note that not one of these developments has been built out yet. The clear decision made by Government yesterday shows that it is not a tenure of housing we want to see, it is not compatible with the "Housing for All" section of the programme for Government, which is what I want to deliver on: good public housing at scale and affordable housing for both purchase and rental. It is a significant decision and it is a very clear one and a break with what was being done.

It is a significantly longer text than the one the Minister and I scrutinised at the previous housing committee. There are a lot of significant changes but also some worrying carryover from the original draft. Maybe the Minister could give the House an overview of some of what he sees as the significant changes in the new general scheme.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	387	The programme for Government contains a commitment in respect of the State playing a greater part in the deliver and direct provision of affordable and social homes and the LDA Bill will play a key role in that regard. I recently received Cabinet approval for a revised general scheme for the LDA Bill, which reflects the commitments in the programme for Government and indeed the consideration of the issues raised during the previous pre-legislative scrutiny in which the Deputy and I both took part during the lifetime of the previous Oireachtas. The revised general scheme provides that the LDA will be established as a statutory corporation, rather than a designated activity company, DAC, but also provides for enabling powers for the LDA to establish subsidiaries as DACs, where appropriate, to deliver on its functions. There are other State bodies established as DACs so this form of corporate structure is, as the Deputy knows, already in use within the State. The revised general scheme also makes clear that one of the principal objectives of the LDA will be to develop sustainable communities, with a particular focus on enhancing the stock of climate resistant, low-carbon and affordable housing. Specific provisions are included in respect of the provision of housing on State lands. With respect to the other part of the Deputy's question, as part of its broad functions in relation to strategic land assembly, it is proposed that the LDA will have compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers but it is expected that it will only be used for ransom strips. The LDA Bill is being drafted as a priority. A great deal of very detailed work is going into it with the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General. It is being drafted as a priority in order to place the LDA on a primary legislative footing.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	388	I thank the Minister for his reply. One of the concerns both he and I had last year was that by using the designated activity companies model for the residential developments, those activities would not be subject to FOI and the lobbying register. That is obviously still the case where the LDA uses the its subsidiaries as the Minister has outlined. There is of course also a concern that the definition of "affordable housing" in the new general scheme is simply a discount on prevailing market prices in that location, which, in many part of this city, would not be affordable. It is very troubling that the agency does not have CPO powers any stronger than those in the last general scheme; ransom strips were there previously and still are. That undermines the ability of the LDA to do its land management function. There is still too little mention of social housing in the general scheme. I think there is only one instance. This means that on land which is not owned by local authorities - such as, for example, the site of the former Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, on which up to 1,000 homes could be built - we could have only 10% social, maybe 30%. How affordable they would be we do not know and there will still be a large volume of homes at open market prices. That is concerning for some of us so maybe the Minister will respond on those issues.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	389	The legislation in question is important and, as the Deputy rightly says, a lot of work and effort went into it in the previous Oireachtas. I was quite critical of parts of the previous heads of Bill that were published and some significant changes have been made in that regard. If one looks at the programme for Government, in the "Housing for All" section, we very clearly define what we want the LDA to do, with a very specific focus on the delivery of public and affordable homes on public land. The priority must be to get it up and running on a statutory footing, a primary legislation footing. That is why I want to get the Bill published in advanced of Christmas. The plan is to do so and move it forward. The Deputy referred to subsidiaries. It is obviously the intention that any subsidiaries created by the LDA for the purpose of developing State lands - should that happen, as this Bill only gives them the power to do so - would be fully owned by the LDA and therefore by the State. That was a concern we had in the past that will be addressed in this. I want to say very clearly that for the purposes of developing State land, any subsidiaries, should they be established, would be fully owned by the LDA and, therefore, owned by the State

It would be helpful if he would give the committee an indication of whether he is willing to do that or not. The committee would of course expedite such a request. I am very concerned, however, because the issue of FOI and the lobbying register remains as problematic today as it was before. The issue of lack of CPO powers remains as it was before and the lack of clarity on the volume of social and genuinely affordable housing that will be delivered on these significant pieces of public land is still as unclear as it was before. Pre-legislative scrutiny would give us an opportunity to tease this out. We do not want to delay the Bill but the most important thing is to get it right and not to rush it, particularly in light of the significant role it is going to play in the years ahead. If we get this wrong, if the set-up does not do what the programme for Government promises, we will end up with a vehicle with very limited adequate public scrutiny of its commercial activities and with very little active land management functions in social and affordable housing, and that would be a bad day's work on everyone's part.

I will certainly through the course of the Second Stage debate and on Committee and Report Stages take on board any amendments deemed fit and appropriate. The one aspect on which I agree with the Deputy is the urgency of the legislation. I do not think, by the way, the restriction of compulsory purchase order powers is something that should raise any concern. What I want the Land Development Agency to do, which is why the Government has provided funding into 2021, is to break ground on Shanganagh Castle and get started on building and delivering homes. We can continue with these political debates on housing delivery or we can get on and deliver the houses. This is why I want the Land Development Agency Bill published and the Land Development Agency established on a primary legislative footing so it can get on and deliver good housing stock for our people.

They live in damp housing and housing that lacks central heating and they also live in areas with significant problems. A total of 25% of people forced to live homeless on our streets have a disability. This is a rate far higher than is in the general population. More than 1,000 people with disabilities under the age of 65, and this is startling, live inappropriately in nursing homes.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	393	I am fully committed to ensuring that accessible social homes are available to persons with disabilities. Budget 2021 has made available €3.3 billion towards a wide range of housing programmes that will deliver 12,750 new social homes for next year. A record 9,500 of these homes will be new build homes, designed and planned using guidelines, build standards and planning regulations supported by the Department. In respect of construction funding over the period from 2016 to 2019, the Department provided almost €2.1 billion to local authorities to deliver new social homes, including new homes for people with disabilities. I will arrange for the officials to provide the Deputy with a breakdown, by local authority. The detailed breakdown of housing funding for 2020 will be finalised at the year's end. The capital assistance scheme is a key programme of delivery of homes for persons with disabilities. The Department also provides a range of specialised grants, including housing adaptation grants for people with a disability of up to €30,000 to assist them to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out. The mobility aids grant scheme is available to fast-track grants of up to €6,000 to cover a suite of basic measures and works to help and assist with mobility problems for any member of a household. It is also worth noting the national housing strategy for people with a disability is due to be reviewed in 2021 and an advisory group is due to meet before the end of this year to assess the pathway to go forward. Each local authority, as the Deputy will be aware, has a housing and disability steering group that includes a director of services of housing, the chair of the council and members of the HSE. This is due to meet a minimum of four times each calendar year.

Between 2,000 and 4,000 people with disabilities are living in congregated settings with ten or more people. This is before we look at the hidden homeless, who are people with disabilities living in the homes of family or friends. Many of them have no expectation of independent living because of the fact those homes may not be suitable for them. Assessment carried out by the Department has shown there has been a significant increase between 2013 and now of those with disabilities who are in housing need. While I appreciate a certain level of development has happened with regard to assessment, it is radically necessary that we invest in making homes accessible to people with disabilities. The Minister of State mentioned the money going into adaptation grants. A sum of €70 million between 31 local authorities is the total amount. When we break it up between 31 local authorities, it is small money. Each year, the demand for this money far exceeds the supply. Local authorities often break it up into lists and typically they do not get past the first list.

I remind the Deputy we have increased funding for adaptation grants consistently over recent years. There was a 19% increase from 2019 to 2020 and it has been increased again for next year. It will be €75 million in 2021. Money has been put behind this. If local authorities are short of money for funding streams, there is additional money for which they can apply through the Department. It is very important this money is spent and that local authorities are proactive in this regard. Local authority members need to drive forward these expenditure patterns. As I have said, the processes are in place and it is up to the local authorities to execute them. We have significant funding and, even in difficult times, funding has been increased. Each year from 2019 to 2021 the funding has been increased. The Minister secured an increase for 2021, which will ease people's issues in terms of mobility and in terms of new builds. These are key with regard to the measures being brought forward by the Government.

Typically in recent years when Governments have quoted increases, they have come from a phenomenally low base. These budgets were slashed significantly after 2011 and stayed extremely low until 2013 and 2014. Independent Living Movement Ireland has assessed local authorities on a sliding scale with regard to how good they are at providing housing and services to people with disabilities. They indicate that two councils, that is, 6% of all councils, were very good at delivering housing. It stated 94% of councils were either average or poor at delivering housing or adaptations for people with disabilities. It rated a total of 65% of councils as poor and nine councils were rated average. If 65% of councils are being rated as poor by those living this experience, it sends a very strong message that we have to listen to in the Chamber. All the reviews in the world will not do what is necessary until we do one thing, which is to match delivery of budget with the need and this is still not there.

We will increase this to more than 10,500 in 2021 because of the significant increase in the budget in recent years. With regard to local authority delivery, a steering group has been established in each of 31 local authorities that can assess why delivery is not as expected if they are not drawing down their funding. This is supposed to meet four times a year. Our review on national policy will be implemented next year. As I said, we will have a meeting before the end of 2020 in this regard. Significant funding is there and it is up to the local authorities to drive that funding and spend it, and up to the groups and processes they have in place to ensure the money is spent properly.

I understand the Lord Mayor of Dublin has written to the Minister. This is an opportunity for us to work together and not be adversarial but to try to put in place a better funding package and a better scheme. I am interested in his thoughts on how best to proceed on this site.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	399	I am aware of Oscar Traynor Road and the decision the city council took. I walked that site myself with Deputy Paul McAuliffe and others, and all of us will agree it has been vacant and unused for far too long. It is a significant site. The proposal rejected by the local authority, which is within its powers and function, would have delivered 853 homes and included 253 social homes fully funded by the Department. A further contribution of just short of €9 million was available to assist in the delivery of 172 additional affordable homes on the site.Following the vote last week, I sought a report from council management. I have received this, and it is short. I am meeting them tomorrow, not just about Oscar Traynor Road, although it will form part of those discussions. Not surprisingly, given the decision, the council has confirmed it needs some time to engage with councillors to gather views and to try to build some consensus on how the sites should be developed. My Department, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Burke and Noonan, will not be found wanting in that regard. We cannot delay too long on this. I do not want to see another protracted discussion back and forth. I would be more than happy to work with the Deputy and others across the House. However, let us be realistic too. The Department and myself, as Minister, cannot build out every site in the country. This one is significant. We will help where we can. I urge the city council and the councillors of all parties and none to work towards a realistic and deliverable proposal so we can work with on this site very quickly. I am meeting the city council tomorrow.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	400	I welcome the Minister's response. He will recall that he worked alongside others in opposition and the then Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, to successfully remove St. Michael's Estate from the land initiative into a much more sustainable public housing funding model that is currently working its way through. That is what we need to do in this instance. The vast majority of councillors who opposed the transfer of land are not opposed to the residential development on that site. In fact, the local community needs social and affordable homes. The best way to proceed is in exactly the way the Minister has outlined, but with some haste, and to secure European Investment Bank funding alongside departmental funding to deliver fully public development on this site. The tenure mixture in terms of social, affordable rental and affordable purchase is a matter for the local councillors and the local community. It is our job to put forward the best funding model. I believe this site could be broken up into several Part VIII sections to expedite planning permission next year, do tendering and procurement in parallel and then be onsite the following year. However, the key is the Department working with the local authority to secure that package of European Investment Bank and departmental funding. I am certainly willing to work constructively with the Minister and others to try to achieve that aim.

I do not want to constrain what the city council will do over the coming weeks by giving my own view on the solution or the way forward with this. All I would say is that there are a number of workable options available and we should not constrain the thinking within the council on what those would be. My Department had provided significant funding under the original proposal, which has been rejected. Housing tenure and different housing types also need to be looked at, without rejecting any one type of housing tenure out of hand, as some have done. I am open to working with others on this to deliver quickly. What I am not open to is having months of protracted discussions on it; I am not interested in that. I want to be open and let the council do its bit and assess what has happened. I am going to meet council management tomorrow and while I am not meeting them solely on Oscar Traynor Road, that will form part of my discussions. I hope we will be able to advance this very quickly over the coming weeks into early January.

We cannot have strategic sites such as this being used, for example, for so-called affordable housing that costs the purchaser between €325,000 for a one-bed up to €380,000 for a three-bed. We cannot have valuable public land like this being used to sell open market, unaffordable housing for between €400,000 and €420,000. I welcome the fact the Minister has given a very clear commitment over a number of months both to deliver public housing on public land to meet social and affordable need, and also, crucially, to oversee a step change in Government policy. The land initiative was never really something that the majority of Dublin city councillors wanted. It was a product of a time capital funding was slashed and we do not have to use that model. What I would say, and I say it in good faith, is that if the Minister wants to demonstrate that his Ministry is radically different from that of his predecessor, Oscar Traynor Road is his opportunity to prove that. He should give the council the options. It cannot pluck funding models out of the sky; the Minister has to show a willingness to work with it. I believe that if he puts those funding models on the table, he will see a welcome response from the councillors.

Will he relax? I think he doth protest too much. Let us deal with this from the perspective that we can resolve this situation. We have an opportunity. We need to develop the lands the State has better and faster. We cannot constrain or restrain the ambition that some local authorities will show in regard to how they deem it fit to develop their lands. Some local authorities are better at doing it than others. I ask people to look at the historical delivery of some local authorities versus others. As to what we will do in regard to this particular site, it affords us an opportunity to look at the issue again and look at how we can deliver faster. Fundamentally, we have to deliver more homes, both public and private, for our people. This year, we will probably deliver under 17,000 house completions and we need at least 33,000 homes, private and public, not just public.

In many ways, they are underutilised and their importance is underestimated. I ask the Minister the amount of funding granted by the DRHE to day services in the past 12 months.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	407	I thank the Deputy for his question. He is correct that day services are crucial. My Department's role is to provide a framework of policy, legislation and funding to support housing authorities to address homelessness locally. To that end, I secured a further €60 million in a Supplementary Estimate for additional Covid-19 measures just the week before last, bringing the total funding for homeless services to €256 million. The Government was not found wanting in taking on the challenge of Covid to protect our most vulnerable - our homeless community. Local decisions on sourcing, operating and funding homeless accommodation and related services are a matter for local authorities. My Department does not fund homeless services directly but contributes towards overall costs incurred by housing authorities in their provision. Under the funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services and may also incur additional expenditure. The precise amounts spent by housing authorities on homeless services, including day services, are, therefore, a matter for the individual housing authorities. The DRHE provides a shared service of behalf of the four local authorities in the Dublin region. Some €121 million was provided in Exchequer funding to the Dublin region in 2019, with €160 million recouped to date in 2020. Certified end of year financial reports for 2019, broken down by region, are available on my Department's website and I will provide them for the Deputy. These reports include a breakdown of expenditure in each region, including day services. The DRHE financial report shows that €5.1 million in expenditure was incurred on day services in 2019. It estimates the total cost for provision of day services in 2020 will be in the region of €3.4 million, with expenditure incurred, to the end of the third quarter, of €2.8 million. End of year certified financial reports for 2020 will be published in January or February 2021.

There is currently no mechanism through which an organisation can apply for funding through or from the DRHE, and that needs to change. The Minister mentioned day services. During the pandemic and during this winter, there has been no open access homeless day service for rough sleepers operating in Dublin through funding from the DRHE. That is a big gap. There are day services like Merchants Quay, but they do not allow anyone into their premises. They provide takeaway sandwiches, which are left on the footpath, and there are no showers. That needs to be addressed. No support is offered to a person rough sleeping in Dublin who may be from Bray, Banagher or Cork.They are deemed ineligible but it is important to remember that no one is ineligible when it comes to becoming homeless. This issue needs to be addressed. I suggest that the Minister visits the Mendicity Institution, which is not funded by the DRHE but opens late seven days a week.

I chair the homelessness delivery task force, which is made up of many of our homeless partners such as Focus Ireland, Depaul Ireland, Dublin Simon Community, Peter McVerry Trust and many others, and we meet on a biweekly basis. Funding is not an issue. We have an issue with the funding for some of the section 10 organisations, which I am also looking at. I have visited centres during the day, including very recently, where activities and services are provided for those who need them now. We have an additional €60 million funding this year on top of what was an increased amount. If there are any specific items the Deputy wishes to bring to my attention or issues with regard to a particular service accessing funding, he should feel free to bring them to me. We will examine them in the context of our overall homeless strategy. We cannot fund every single group. That is why it is done through the local authorities, which have the boots on the ground. I am happy to look at any particular items the Deputy brings to my attention.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	410	I appreciate that. I reiterate that the administration of funding by the DRHE and the way it determines who it funds needs to be examined. I invite the Minister to visit the Mendicity Institution, which is open. It is more than 200 years in existence so it has a strong track record. It provides shelter and support because somebody homeless who arrives from outside of Dublin is not given any supports and is deemed ineligible. That is not acceptable. People arrive in Dublin for particularly complex reasons and to say they are ineligible does not cut it in this day and age. They are not even assessed. They are not even given a bed for one night. That needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I urge the Minister to examine that and make something happen in respect of it.

That is the reason we have put unprecedented resources into that particular area. Thankfully, even since early April this year, we have seen a continued reduction in both family and singles homelessness and in respect of children. That is a trend we want to continue. That is the reason we need to ramp up exits from homelessness. So far this year we have had more than 4,300 exits from homelessness and we are targeting 6,000 for next year. It is a job we have got to tackle. Where the Deputy is talking about funding for day services, no one is being turned away. When people move to Dublin from other areas of the country, there are issues about the way that is managed. I get the point the Deputy is making but it is important that we know there is emergency bed capacity in every city and every region in the country. The winter plan is in place. There is additional capacity, and I check that every single week. I hope we get to a stage where we do not need those types of facilities, which I have visited. There is capacity right now for people in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and all our major cities so no one, with the assistance of the State, should be sleeping rough. There are facilities in place for them.

We took this question earlier and it could not be linked because Deputy Ó Broin's was a priority question but we actually did that. The 253 social homes were fully funded by the Department and €8.6 million or €8.7 million in the serviced sites fund was available to go towards the affordable housing. It is a significant site. There are many other significant sites across the country and other sites have been delivered much quicker. With regard to the history of the Oscar Traynor Road sit, there have been missed opportunities in the past. I am meeting with the management of Dublin City Council tomorrow. I have engaged with councillors there. The Lord Mayor has written to me. I have engaged with the Fianna Fáil group, my own colleagues who have been in contact and others, as I should do. I want to do this in an organised way. I asked for the report from the city council. It has responded with a concise report but it has asked for a little time to consult its members on this and to work through revised proposals. Should they be realistic I have to assess whatever proposals come forward. On the provision of social and affordable homes on the site, we will not be found wanting in that regard. I will look at any realistic alternative proposal that comes forward but as I mentioned to other colleagues earlier, I do not want this to go on for months. We do not have that luxury. I would say to councillors across the country that our local authorities also have a responsibility to deliver homes. People sometimes want the perfect scheme that fits their own political ideology. Sometimes compromise will be required to deliver homes that people urgently need. I am open to working with people. I am not looking at Deputy Boyd Barrett when I say that. I know he is getting a little paranoid this evening but I am not. I am simply saying that we need to focus on what needs to be done, which is delivering homes, both public and private, for our people on our own land. I will look at any realistic proposal that comes forward and I will help.

I agree with his previous comments that there needs to be consensus on this issue. A non-adversarial approach is the way to proceed. There needs to be quick delivery. That is a strong view in the local community. Beyond that we need housing delivered on this site and on others. There is full agreement on that. The Minister has said a number of times that he will look at realistic proposals. I want to tease that out with him. What is his view of what are realistic proposals?

That is nonsense talk, and the reference to ideology is nonsense talk. The Minister has his ideology and the ideology of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party has dominated housing policy forever. The result is that sites in public ownership, which should long since have had public housing built on them, have sat empty because over those years they insisted, in one shape or another, on involving private capital and that delayed everything. I have a proposal for the lands at Oscar Traynor Road. Build public housing on the land now and lift the income thresholds so that people from different income backgrounds can get on the list to get housing. Why do we not try that? We do not try it because the Minister's ideology does not want it.

We may have just heard one but, having said that, I am interested in results and building homes. That is what we are about. I am not sure how many homes the Deputy or his ideology has built in this State. It is probably none. What we are about is delivering homes for people and for families. I know that is something that is of interest to the Deputy. To answer Deputy O'Callaghan's question, which he put in a constructive way, I will look at realistic proposals. I will not close the door on anything. It may turn out that it is Deputy Boyd Barrett's proposal to raise the social housing limits. It may be people with €500,000 salaries or whatever or maybe we just pull the money out of the sky and build whatever we want but we have to be realistic about it. I will fund the public housing on it. We have done that already. The 253 units I referred to are funded under the Department. I want to see good, affordable housing for purchase and rent but, to be fair, I want to give the local authority some space to assess what it will come back to me on.I have said I am open to working with them on it. I will meet the local authority at 10 a.m. tomorrow and intend to see how we can move it forward. I do not mean to be disrespectful to Deputy Boyd Barrett. I respect him. I know we are all interested in this and there is some frustration that homes are not being delivered more quickly. This Government will change that, and I would like to be able to work with colleagues to do it.

Most of us want the same thing. The proposals that were voted down by councillors, including from the Minister's party, would have resulted in about half the site almost certainly going to an institutional investor and some of those homes effectively being rented back to the State under HAP. We know that there is planning permission for 40,000 homes, mainly from the strategic housing development process. These are mainly apartments and are largely going to institutional investors for build-to-rent purposes. We have no shortage in the context of that model and it would have been a mistake to have public land use that model too. When will we have a definitive view from the Minister about what proposals can go forward, particularly in view of the urgency of the matter?

It has not delivered, so that is not real. The lists are long and we should look at the cost. With HAP or RAS, in my area the rent is €2,000 a month to a private landlord. That is €580,000 over 25 years for social housing and the State does not even own it. If the State does a leasing deal of €28,000 per annum, that is €600,000 over 25 years and it does not own anything at the end of it. If the State purchases a turnkey property, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service report from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform states that it will cost €80,000 more than the local authority building it itself. Why do we not just get local authorities to build properties themselves? It is cheaper, we will own the properties at the end and it can be done more quickly because one does not have to involve all sorts of other players and thereby complicate and delay matters, as has happened. We either do not get it or it costs us a fortune and we own nothing at the end. Why do we not just build it ourselves?

The Department supports local authorities to improve their social housing stock through a range of funding programmes including energy retrofitting, regeneration and refurbishment works to vacant properties in order to return these to productive use as quickly as possible. Dubllin City Council has a large stock of social housing and I understand that it has completed a strategic development audit of its 220 apartment complexes in order to develop a programme of works that will feed into its capital housing apartment complex regeneration programme for 2020 to 2040. Regarding Pearse House, I understand that the council is examining the options for improvement works, which includes a protected structure, and is engaged with local elected members to this end. Following this process, it is a matter for the council to bring forward proposals for works and to apply for funding under the relevant social housing programme depending on the nature and scope of works required. I am absolutely committed to delivering on the programme for Government objectives and, in particular, to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, as outlined by my colleague, with an emphasis on new builds and to progress a State-backed affordable home purchase scheme to promote home ownership. The Government has backed up these objectives in budget 2021, with €3.3 billion in total funding being made available for the delivery of housing programmes. The overall investment will see the social housing needs of over 28,500 households being met in 2021. This includes 12,750 new social homes to be delivered through build, acquisition and leasing programmes. While we work to deliver these new homes, particularly social and affordable, working with local authorities and other delivery partners, it is also important that councils maintain and upgrade their existing stock. The budget includes funding for both these approaches and we will work with the city council and other local authorities to that end.

I do not know if he is aware of Pearse House. It is a remarkable flat complex in the inner city, between Pearse Street and Hanover Street. There are 345 flats there. It was designed by Herbert Simms. It is a fantastic location but it is in dire need of refurbishment and retrofitting. Great people live in Pearse House but for the past 20 years they have had to put up with substandard accommodation. One significant problem in the flat complex is the significant dampness. That needs to be tackled through a major refurbishment project. I am aware that Dublin City Council announced in October that it was planning a major refurbishment and retrofitting project for Pearse House. It is important that the Department gets behind it. I was concerned by what was stated by Dublin City Council at the time. It indicated that it would take between 12 and 15 years to carry out the refurbishment work. That is far too long. The problems there need to be resolved immediately, especially the dampness. It is unfair to ask people to live in those conditions when we have given a commitment that we can fix it.

The Deputy referred to the design of the flats by Dublin city architect Herbert Simms, which were built between 1936 and 1938. I am familiar with Pearse House. From a heritage perspective, these flat complexes throughout the city are vitally important. The Deputy rightly points out the issue of dampness. This is a significant public health problem, which causes respiratory problems for families. We hope to have that addressed. It is also important to the note the embodied energy in these buildings. From a climate action perspective, the greenest buildings that we have are the ones that are already built. We want to ensure that these apartments complexes throughout the city, with more than 220 apartment complexes under Dublin City Council, are brought up to a high level of thermal comfort for families. We recognise the importance of achieving that standard.

The problem with the flats is that they were built in the 1930s, and many were built to a size that would not be acceptable today. For example, the one bedroom apartments are there are 37 sq. m to 39 sq. m, compared with the current minimum standard of 45 sq. m. Two bedroom residences are 49 sq. m to 56 sq. m, compared with the minimum standard now of 73 sq. m, and three bedroom apartments are approximately 62 sq. m, compared with the minimum standard now of 90 sq. m. I have had the opportunity to speak with the Minister about the matter and I know he is committed to seeing this work through. In fairness, he has committed to a meeting which we will have in due course. For the residents in the flat complex, it is important that the Department sends out a message that it will not let Dublin City Council let this drift on for ten to 15 years. The people living in the flats need to see the work being done promptly. The dampness is not just a societal issue but a health issue. I ask the Minister of State to expedite it and ensure that works are done.

Just to outline the works on Pearse House in the past 24 months, all roofs were repaired in 2018. Blocks A and C had their roofs upgraded in March 2019. Stairwells were repaired in 2019. A drainage survey of the entire complex was completed in 2018. There were repairs to the network system, and upgrades to the fire and domestic alarms and ventilation units, which relate to dampness, a matter the Deputy raised.These are ongoing refurbishments and are part of a wider in-depth national regeneration programme that includes community development approaches of inclusion and of tackling the causes of disadvantage in these communities.

I have heard some very concerning figures, particularly from Galway and Cork, in the past number of months. Can the Minister update the House on his discussions with the homeless service providers and what additional actions intends to take to address this very tragic set of circumstances?
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	436	I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue, which we also discussed six weeks ago. There have been, as he rightly said, a number of deaths recently of people who were either rough sleeping or accessing homeless services. Every death is a tragedy. I have already and will extend again my sympathy to their families, friends and to the service providers who get to know many of their clients very well. We all know that every single death hurts in that respect. To better understand what is happening the DRHE, along with the HSE, have jointly commissioned a time-bound detailed review of all recent deaths in homeless services. It will be authored by Dr. Jo-Hanna Ivers, who is assistant professor in addiction at the department of public health and primary care in the school of medicine, Trinity College Dublin, who is a very eminent person with experience who has done work in Britain where she published an article in the British Medical Journal on the five year standardised mortality ratios in a cohort of homeless people in Dublin. We also need to understand what is behind this. The week before last I visited a wonderful development on Haddington Road of an old 1820s house which has been refurbished into 18 single apartments. Pat Doyle, the chief executive of the Peter McVerry Trust, explained it very well when he said that there are stories behind each of these deaths. He spoke of one gentleman who sadly passed away earlier this year who was a friend of Fr. McVerry himself. The trust had supported him for years and he died of cancer earlier this year. He passed away in his own place with his own key and with support all around him. He is included as a homeless death because he was accessing homeless services, and rightly so. It would be wrong, however, to believe that he and many others in those numbers are people who have died on the streets. Some have and that is not something that we want to see. We need to get a better picture of what is happening to see if there are any trends because there has been a marked increase. The work mentioned is a time-bound one which I will share with colleagues and with the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

In many cases what we are seeing is the overlap of three sets of issues - homelessness, mental health and addiction - and the lack of adequate provision of those three services at the right time and place to meet the needs of individuals ,which in many cases, unfortunately, puts them at greater risk of tragic and unnecessary death. I have argued previously that we need to increase supports for mental health and addiction services and to press ahead with the programme for Government commitments on implementing Housing First, and on decongregating emergency accommodation. We need to introduce adult safeguarding reviews, as they have in Britain, to look back at where these deaths have occurred to see what lessons can be learned. I take issue with one thing said by the Minister and this is said with the greatest respect because we need to have this conversation in a sensible way. It is not appropriate to include people who are in tenancies in the category that we are talking about and I am aware that other homeless services have expressed this view to the Minister. We are specifically talking about people who have either died while sleeping rough or while in emergency accommodation homeless services. That is an important distinction.

All I am saying is that I used the example of that gentleman and there are others, who are people who were accessing homeless services and counted in these terrible figures and shocking statistics. That is just to simply state a fact. I chair the north Dublin regional drugs and alcohol task force and I am aware of the need to increase funding. I see the work that is done through Housing First. Up to the end of September, 459 individuals were housed through Housing First and we have committed as a Government and have secured additional funding for budget 2021 to expand Housing First further. We discussed this at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage when I attended last week. That is something that we need to do and to also ensure that the mental health and addiction ancillary services are in place. Housing First is an excellent approach. We need to continue to expand that further and that is what we are going to do.

The original Housing First strategy introduced by the previous Government only committed to approximately 600 Housing First tenancies up to next year. We need in the region of 3,000 to deal with the current number of individuals who need that particular support and that is where we need to get to. I press the point that it is not about categorising; it is about being evidence-based. We are talking about people who are in emergency accommodation or sleeping rough.

The Minister probably agrees with that point and I look forward to the report and to his engagement with the committee but we also need to see what additional interventions will be put in place so that we have a reduction next year in these very tragic and, in many cases, preventable and unnecessary deaths.

Will this review examine the changes that have been made in the past year or so in the increased use of private hostel operators who have been contracted to provide accommodation for people who have become homeless? These operators, in the main, do not provide support services with the accommodation. Is this aspect being examined in the review? Some private operators have rules in place, which do not allow chatting and other infringements of basic human rights. We also have reports of people who have been barred by some of these private hostel operators for minor infringements and have slept rough as a result. Is this review into tragic issue of homeless deaths considering the changes that have been made with the engagement of private operators?

I am just asking because the Deputy has a question on a particular issue, just a couple of questions down on the list. Returning to Deputy Ó Broin’s point, we need to look at how these deaths are reported. I am going to do that and am giving a commitment here, as well as when the report is completed. The appropriate place for that is the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and this would be a good thing to do. I have not asked the professor herself but if the author of the report is willing and is invited by the committee when she has concluded the report, that again is an appropriate thing to do. As to Deputy O’Callaghan’s question on private operators, I also mentioned this at the committee meeting when I was there, the DRHE is also carrying out spot inspections. They have done 126 of these since January. I am concerned about the couple of instances raised by the Deputy. If he is aware of specific hostels where these issues are arising, I ask that he bring these to my attention and not to delay in this as I know he will not. We will look into it immediately. There are standards that even private operators must follow and they are subject to full inspection, and rightly so.

As he will be aware, this strategic housing development has proposed the construction of 274 units, comprising of 46 houses and 228 apartments, but, unfortunately, arising from the consultation between an Bord Pleanála and the LDA, An Bord Pleanála has stopped the planned development and is waiting on further information on the development.

The LDA is currently working on a HSE-owned 14.5-acre site on the grounds of St. Kevin's Hospital, Cork. The agency has advised my Department that this site will deliver approximately 274 units. The project is currently in the pre-planning stage, with a strategic housing development pre-application consultation already completed with An Bord Pleanála. The LDA envisages that the strategic housing development planning application will be lodged for the site by the end of 2020. As with all State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department, arrangements have been put in place by the agency whereby Oireachtas Members can request information directly from it regarding operational matters. In this regard, it may be contacted directly at oireachtas@lda.ie. Once the planning application proceeds, we expect a decision to be made by An Bord Pleanála within a 16-week period. This will be a significant project for the LDA because we note the agency will be a huge arm of the State in the delivery of low-cost, affordable quality homes for citizens. The site, along with the other nine currently in the ownership of the agency, is part of the proposal to deliver 4,000 quality homes, which are very important to our citizens.

In 2002, the facility was closed down. For 18 years, it has lain idle. We have had Fianna Fáil in government, Fine Gael in government and a mixture, yet nothing has been done. I welcome the announcement but in 2013, seven years ago, I sought to have the site developed. On a number of occasions, I went to Cork City Council seeking a partnership with the likes of Cork Institute of Technology, UCC and homelessness services to have a sustainable site but nothing happened. The first Minister I went to was Mr. Phil Hogan, and I also approached Deputies Coveney and Eoghan Murphy. I raised it with everyone. We need the site developed. The Government and HSE spent hundreds of thousands of euro protecting it with security firms but, in 2017, it was burned to the ground.

We can only be accountable for what is under our jurisdiction in the Department. I have advised the Deputy that the planning application is expected to be lodged by the end of this year. There is a lead time of 16 weeks from that date for the planning application to go through its verification process. We expect the units to be delivered. It is one of the primary sites under the control of the LDA to deliver high-quality homes for our citizens. As I pointed out, the LDA, as a significant State agency, has a unique opportunity to deliver the homes on the nine sites under its control, one of which is in my constituency - a very significant site at Columb Barracks. We look forward to developing them to ensure we have high-quality, cost-rental affordable homes for our citizens.

I welcome the proposal but what I am looking for now are definite timelines. If the work starts in 2021, when will it be completed? We have been waiting for far too long. There are thousands of families on the housing lists of Cork city and county councils. The site overlooks the River Lee and the Mardyke. It is one of the most picturesque sites overlooking the Lee Valley. It would be brilliant to have a development there. Unfortunately, St. Kevin's was a mental health institution where some tragedies happened. Any development should remember this and the victims.

I am sure the LDA will liaise with the local authority in respect of that. With regard to the application, I have given the Deputy a clear timeline, referring to the end of the year. Once the application is submitted, there will be a 16-week verification process. With regard to building housing, the LDA has progressed immediately with planning on its sites before even being put on a primary statutory footing. It was key for it to get on with business once established. The Minister and I have a revised Bill, which we will publish shortly, in connection with this. We are in the business of trying to deliver high-quality, affordable homes for citizens. That is our core determination in the Department.

#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	456	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 64 and 95 together. Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. The 2011 regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy. The 2011 regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. Under the household means policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, universal social charge and pension-related deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short term or once-off in nature. The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%, and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.

A working couple with an income of, say, €38,500 would not get any mortgage. They would not even be able to afford rent in this city or any of the surrounding counties. There needs to be a proper examination of the criteria so there will be a realistic income level. I am not suggesting we should increase it in such a way as to have an open-ended system. I understand the housing system is designed to facilitate those most in need but many of the couples, because they cannot afford to rent or afford a mortgage, are now stuck at home with their parents or siblings in overcrowded accommodation. That has led to a loss of jobs, suicides and other problems.It needs to be addressed and it should have been addressed before now.

I was promised that a review would be completed and carried out and that income limits would be improved. This was back when the Ministers with responsibility for housing were Deputy Coveney and, subsequently, Deputy Eoghan Murphy and the relevant Minister of State was Deputy English. I have cited cases in the House previously involving a one-parent family with the mother working in a part-time low-paid job and getting the family income supplement. Such a mother with two or three children is unable to get on the council housing list. That is wrong because that person has no chance of getting a loan. Even if she did get a loan, she could not sustain or service it. There is a cohort of people who are working, oftentimes in low-paid jobs, unfortunately, in difficult circumstances. These are often from one-parent families and they are dependent on the family income supplement. By definition, their income is not sustainable from their employment. They are expected to house themselves without State assistance or without getting on the local authority list. This review needs to be finalised and we need a big improvement in the income limits. This needs to be addressed as early as possible. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to make progress on this.

We need this review. We need to ensure we have reasonable income levels. We have people who are caught in the middle and they are suffering. We need affordable cost-rental, affordable mortgages and council houses. We need to take into account not only income levels but also that people have increased costs. I am talking about people who may have children with serious mobility issues or a disability. I have in mind one particular issue that has come to my attention lately in Dundalk. We are not exactly sure how we are going to deal with it. I also know of many cases involving people who spend eight, nine or ten years on the housing list. At the last moment they may get a small increase in wages and then miss out on having a council house on that basis. They cannot afford a mortgage by any stretch of the imagination.

We all face these issues at our clinics every week. They involve people who are on the margins. We see people missing out on the housing list because of income that potentially should be disregarded. That can be most frustrating. I wish to set out the position of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has secured a 24% increase in the capital budget. This will give more options in terms of different channels. We can direct people to the affordable purchase scheme and the cost rental equity scheme. We have asked the Housing Agency to assess these two schemes on the back of the review that has been done to increase the income limits. The processes need to go together. We expect to publish the review early next year. We expect a significant number of options for people. A total of €110 million is ring-fenced for affordable measures. That is concrete and definite for next year. Obviously, we will then assess what more can be done to ensure people get secure accommodation, because that is the will of everyone in the House.

The average rent in Dublin at present is over €2,000. For families who are on approximately €40,000 or €45,000 per year, that means two weeks' wages or more. The minimum income required for the average priced house in Dublin is over €100,000 and the average house price is over €400,000. There is no hope for them. That is the way they see it. They are cut off from all those options and they are also cut off from social housing in any shape or form. I call on the Minister of State to accelerate the delivery of affordable houses and affordable rental with faster provision than is the case at the moment.

In his initial response he spoke about sustainable communities. Thankfully, over many decades we had local authority policies that worked well with local authority housing and a mix of households. We will not have sustainable communities if we do not improve the income limits. We will only have people who are on low incomes, especially those dependent solely on the State for income if we do not improve the income limits. The counties I represent, Cavan and Monaghan, are in the lowest tier in respect of the bands referred to by the Minister of State. If there is no change soon, we will condemn a generation to renting for life. No one in this House wants to see that. People are entitled to be able to aspire to own their own home whether through the local authority or through a mortgage or loan of their own. We need action on this. Again, I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke. I know both are highly committed to making progress in this area. We need progress as rapidly as possible or we are condemning more and more people to rent for life.

It is much appreciated. It has already been said that there are eligibility issues. The income levels simply do not cut it. In fairness, it has been said in the House that people may find themselves in situations where the family income supplement or something else puts them a little above the criteria. We need to have some element of flexibility. I have spoken about the situation that some people find themselves in. Combined with low incomes that may be a little over the threshold, some families may also have considerable outgoings. This may be down to the fact of children with additional needs. That needs to be taken into account. To add to what Deputy Brendan Smith has said on creating a situation whereby mixed developments are not necessarily going to happen, I suggest this will force an issue that has happened in many cases in which people choose not to take up a job or employment to ensure they can afford to pay the rent by being able to access the housing assistance payment.

The sole focus of this Department is to ensure that we provide secure accommodation that all our citizens can access equally. We should always instil hope in people because there is hope. People who are on the margins can take consolation from the significant budget we have secured for the Department for 2021. As I have said, the Housing Agency is assessing all of this based on the new cost rental and affordable schemes due to be published shortly and the income eligibility review. On that basis, the agency will be able to ascertain what income can be disregarded in terms of various social welfare payments. I fully accept the frustration expressed by Deputies that this review has been going on a while. However, we have moved considerably in the Department in recent months in terms of the new measures that have been brought in to ensure affordability. This has been put to the forefront of the Department. We also have to assess the review on that basis. It will be early next year. I can assure the House of that.

The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, was a means of providing the infrastructure to facilitate local authority housing. I hope my question will come in tabular form.

A total of 30 projects were approved with an overall budget of €195.7 million while €146.8 million was Exchequer funded and the remainder was funded by local authorities. Full details of the approvals are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website. The relevant website link is www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF. Of the 30 projects, two projects will not proceed. Kildare County Council has confirmed that the Naas inner relief road will not progress and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has confirmed that the Clay Farm project will now not proceed. Currently, five LIHAF projects have completed infrastructure construction. Up to the end of October, a total of 12 projects were at infrastructure construction stage or had been approved to move to same. Of the remaining 11 projects, one is expected to have a tender approved in the fourth quarter of 2020 and to go to construction in the first quarter of 2021. A total of ten projects are not yet ready to go to infrastructure tender stage, a precursor to receive approval to proceed to construction. My Department keeps all projects under review with the local authority. All funding under LIHAF is now fully committed and there are no proposals to make further allocations. The serviced sites fund of €310 million is now available to local authorities for facilitating infrastructure on their lands to support their delivery of affordable housing.

In relation to the schemes that have been approved and the moneys that have been spent, to what extent has local authority house building or house building to meet the requirements of the local population been advanced?

Tá mé an-sásta an Bille seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Tá an Bille fíorthábhachtach don trédhearcacht agus chun a chinntiú go bhfuil an Dáil ag obair ar son na ndaoine. I am delighted to move what is my first Bill in the Dáil alongside my colleague, Deputy Doherty. The topic of public standards goes to the heart of a well-functioning democratic system. The corollary of this is that poor public standards lead to a poorly functioning democratic system. Recent months alone have shown the need for increased regulation of lobbying. The Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has long been calling for this and urgent action is needed. I hope to have cross-party support because I believe that the enacting of this legislation would be the sensible thing to do. In fact, it would be the commonsensical thing to do. I am disappointed that the Government's amendment seeks a further review, this time of section 22, in what seems to be a case of the Government pushing the Bill I am presenting down the road. There was a review in 2016 and another in 2019. We do not need another. We need action. This is not rocket science. It is a clear and straightforward way of dealing with a problem that we as politicians face. It is time that the Dáil called "Stop" on the revolving door between political life and lobbying activities. That revolving door may have served the self-interest of some former Ministers, but it has not served the public's interest. A revolving door between politics and the lobbying industry is corrosive to democracy and undermines the public's confidence that our political system is responsive to people's needs rather than those of unelected vested interest groups. This Bill would change that. When reviews of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 took place, SIPO, the body that ensures standards in public office, made recommendations to strengthen its hand when dealing with breaches of the Act. Our Bill would implement 13 of the 22 recommendations made by SIPO to the Government in 2019. Some of them would broaden the scope of the Act, some would make definitional changes and some would enact new provisions. The Bill would increase from one to two years the length of the so-called cooling off period that Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers and high-ranking civil servants must wait before moving from office to the lobbying sector. This increase would simply be following best practice. People have said that this would interfere with people's right to work, but the Bill contains a provision allowing SIPO to waive or shorten the cooling off period if it believed a strong enough case had been made. The Bill would also allow SIPO to investigate and sanction breaches of the cooling off period. What is the point in having such a period if it does not need to be adhered to? Surely the commonsensical thing to do is legislate to close this loophole. The Bill would give SIPO the power to investigate and sanction a person or body that is a lobbyist that avoids his, her or its obligations under the Act. A simple and straightforward way of stopping people from trying to avoid the requirements of the legislation would be to have an anti-avoidance provision. It would make sense and is what is contained in the Bill. The Bill outlines clearly that a designated public official must cut off contact with a person who has failed to comply with the registration of lobbying activities. Not only that, but the official would need to inform SIPO in writing. If SIPO became aware of a non-compliant person or body, it could tell a designated public official that he or she must cease all communication with that entity. It would be for SIPO to decide for how long that would apply. This is a clear and straightforward way of dealing with breaches of the Act. The Bill would require compliance with the code of conduct by people carrying out lobbying activities whereas the Act only requires them to have regard to it. Importantly, SIPO would have the power to conduct inquiries into reported breaches. The Bill is urgently needed in the interests of accountability and transparency. There is no point in suggesting that we must wait for another review and take another look at the issue in a number of months' time. Let us bring the Bill to Committee Stage, have a thorough discussion on it, finally give SIPO the powers it has been calling for since 2016 and work together to shut the door between government and vested interests.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	472	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this legislation, which has been tabled by my colleague, Deputy Mairéad Farrell, and me on behalf of the Sinn Féin Party. Recent months have shone a light on the revolving door that exists between private interests and government, between corporate lobbyists and the corridors of power. We have been saying that this was happening for far too long. The light has shown us that we need stronger regulations and to close the revolving door between government and vested interests. We discussed at length inside and outside the House the fact that the Tánaiste, who was the then Taoiseach, divulged commercially sensitive and confidential information to the head of a lobby group that, as a matter of Government policy, had been excluded from contract negotiations. The president of that group just happened to be the Tánaiste's friend. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, refused as part of the Government to release all of the communications despite him, the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health saying that they would be made available. The revolving door between government and vested interests has a corrosive effect on government. It undermines public trust and reveals a system where private interests have a shortcut to the top of the table while the rest of the public have to wait in the queue. We have seen poachers turning gamekeepers. In the past three months, a Minister of State has become a lobbyist and a lobbyist has become a member of the commission that regulates lobbying. One could simply not make it up, but the Minister did because he is the person who proposed Ms Geraldine Feeney to take on that role. When the Minister for Finance sits down with the banking sector, which he is supposed to regulate, he looks across the table and sees a former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Mr. Brian Hayes, his party colleague. In September, another Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Mr. Michael D'Arcy, became CEO of a private lobbying firm three months after he left the Department. The lobbying group - the Irish Association of Investment Managers, IAIM - lobbied him while he was Minister of State to extend generous tax breaks that reduced the tax liability of multinational executives by hundreds of thousands of euro per year. Incidentally, that tax break was extended until the end of 2020 while he was in the Department. Mr. D'Arcy's appointment as CEO has shown the weaknesses in how we regulate the relationship between government and corporate lobbyists. According to the rules laid out in the 2015 Act, it is regulated by SIPO. Under that legislation, a former Minister, special adviser or senior civil servant should cool off for at least a year after leaving office before taking up a role to lobby the Government. However, the regulations are not working. Despite Mr. D'Arcy breaking them by becoming the CEO of the IAIM only three months after leaving office, SIPO has no power to investigate or sanction him. Was this an oversight or a loophole? Absolutely not, because SIPO wrote to the Government in 2016 asking it to close this loophole and give SIPO the power to investigate and sanction people in such cases. In 2019, SIPO did so again, but the Fine Gael Government ignored every single one of the 22 recommendations that SIPO made in 2016 and 2019. Those recommendations would have enhanced transparency and accountability. In ignoring them, that Government allowed Mr. D'Arcy to breach the regulations without any fear of consequence because that is the Fine Gael way. That is the revolving door between government and vested interests. That is what we in Sinn Féin, through this legislation, aim to close down. The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, believes he needs more time.We need another round of consultations. We need to listen to what SIPO has told us for four years. The Department reviewed it twice, under a different Minister. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said that there was nothing to see here and that we should not implement any of its recommendations. We have a different view. As I said, this has a corrosive effect on the Government. For far too long bankers, the insurance industry and other vested interests have had a grip on the Government that the ordinary public could never have. This Bill should not be delayed; its implementation is overdue. We need to give the power to SIPO to act where it needs to act.

I also want to thank my colleagues, Deputies Doherty and Mairéad Farrell, for bringing forward the Bill and their offices for all of the hard work they have done to try to regulate the area of lobbying. Given all that has happened this year, this is a very timely Bill. The Minister probably knows and should acknowledge that. Everyone in the State, with the possible exception of those who have sat on successive Government benches, knows that the problem of the cosy consensus between big business, finance and politics must come to an end. Most people know that a culture of insiders and outsiders, or a little bit of "Upstairs, Downstairs", has been created over decades. The vast majority of people are on the outside. The likes of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and their mates in the Green Party are inside the tent. When one is inside the tent, one gets to rub shoulders with banks, big finance, multinational corporations, insurance companies and hedge funds. Those outside the tent are ordinary people who try their best and work hard. No matter how hard they work, the system always seems to work against them. When they see former Ministers and Ministers of State from the Department of Finance lobbying for investment funds, banks and large corporations, they know why that is. With the greatest of respect to some who have made that journey, the public know that for many of them it is not for their insight, intellect or hard work that they have been hired as lobbyists by these organisations. They are being taken on to give these companies access to the corridors of power because their friends are in the Minister's chair, they have all of the Ministers' numbers in their phones and can open doors that others simply cannot. This says so much about the type of Government that exists - a Government that would facilitate such lobbying by big finance and business and say that it is not the right time now to do the right thing and that we will have accountability but not now. As I have said, the Government is allergic to accountability. It is the same Government that ignores workers and trade unions and pushes SMEs, microbusinesses and small family-run businesses to one side. Nowhere was this more evident than during the summer when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, visited their friend and former Fine Gael Minister of State at the Department of Finance and MEP, Brian Hayes, who is now the CEO of Banking & Payments Federation Ireland. They went to him to talk about the pillar banks, of which the State is the main shareholder in many cases. Extending mortgage payment breaks for those affected by the Covid crisis for another six months was on the agenda. Two Fine Gael Ministers met a former Fine Gael Minister of State and now banking lobbyist about payment breaks for ordinary working people. It is no wonder that the answer was "No" and mortgage holders here were not given the same protection as their peers in other European countries. These practices are corrosive to democracy. They undermine ordinary people's expectations and belief that our political system is responsive to their needs rather than the needs of well-heeled and unelected special interest groups. This is an urgent and necessary Bill and Sinn Féin will seek cross-party support. Now is the right time to do the right thing.
#MartinBrowne	unknown-#MartinBrowne-party	unknown-#MartinBrowne-dob	unknown-#MartinBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	474	I thank Deputies Mairéad Farrell and Doherty for bringing the Bill forward. The purpose of the Bill is to update current legislation on lobbying so that our citizens can have confidence that the political system is there to serve them and not itself. As things stand, the current legislation allows for a rather loose reading of lobbying laws which allows rules to be open to interpretation and for a revolving door between Government and big businesses to turn constantly. This is why Sinn Féin is attempting to amend the legislation, given the relationship between high finance, big business and the political establishment over the years. The influence involved is apparent in the unwillingness of successive Governments to take on the banks or the insurance industry. I want to outline the impact of this on the people in my county. There is a severe housing crisis in Tipperary, where more than 3,600 people are on the housing waiting list. People find themselves in a range of challenging situations and are unable to get a home of their own, a local authority house or, in many cases, private accommodation. This is happening at a time when I became aware that a house was sold by a bank to a vulture fund for €40,000. Private citizens have no hope or chance of getting a deal like that. That is why people who have been approved for the housing assistance payment but cannot find a house or flat to rent contact my office daily. This is a prime example of how vulture funds have been given permission to run amok. They snap up properties for next to nothing and sell them at inflated prices to those who can afford them, leaving those on meagre incomes to remain on housing waiting lists for years. These funds have created this situation because policies have enabled them to do so, and we wonder why we have a housing crisis. For too long, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have allowed the use of a revolving door between politics and the lobbying industry. The optics of this are not good enough, as we have seen with certain departures from the world of politics to lobbying industries, such as Brian Hayes and Michael D'Arcy. We propose that if senior political insiders want to leave the world of policy formation to join the lobbying sector they will have to wait for a longer period of time to do so. If we tighten up the rules, the impression that ministerial office can be used to advance self-interest may be dealt with. We hear all the time that politicians are only in it for themselves. This is a concern we seek to address. SIPO has called for legislative changes since 2016 to broaden the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015. During that time, Governments have effectively resisted these changes and instead opted to instead water them down to reviews. That is what the Government wants to do again. If Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael published a dictionary and one looked up the word "review", one would find it to find as a term similar to delay, postpone or shelve. The Taoiseach is attempting to do that now. Sinn Féin's amendments seek to bring into effect a number of recommendations made by SIPO. It will increase the cooling-off period which is the length of time that Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers and high-ranking civil servants must wait before moving from public office to the lobbying sector. It would also get rid of a grey area in the current Act regarding the code of conduct for persons carrying out lobbying activities. The original Act specifies that a person must have regard to the code rather than adhering to it. We are addressing that. The undue influence of lobbyists has resulted in an unaccountable insurance sector and a housing crisis that has been made possible by a hands-off approach towards the banks, insurance industry and vulture funds. When it comes to political lobbying in this country there has been a serious lack of accountability. We seek to address that. I appeal to all parties and Independent Deputies to support the Bill and make our system work for the people rather than the well-connected or well-heeled.

It has failed to reach that threshold by a country mile. It has been said to me on countless occasions by smaller groups and activists that it could reasonably be argued that the Act was designed to ensure they are penalised disproportionately compared to professional lobbyists in an effort to keep their voices the quietest in the room – often they are not even in the room. The lobbying Act is not fit for purpose and must be updated and amended to ensure there is real oversight of lobbyists beyond signing generic codes of conduct that include non-defined statements such as "avoiding improper influence". Describing it as regulation of lobbying implies that there is actual regulation and full transparency not only in respect of those who are doing the lobbying but also those on whose behalf they are lobbying. It implies that there are substantive consequences for non-compliance and that those who are not in compliance are held accountable. There is a world of difference between lobbying and engagement. The Act should have been an effective mechanism to enable citizens and organisations to make their views on public policy known and on an equal basis. It should have been that way, but the public perception of lobbying is that it is a mechanism for big business which has access to the highest public offices and legislators in the land to progress their interests. It is a 21st century version of the old Punch cartoons that depicted the cosy relationship between Governments and industrial interests in the early 20th century.  I have real concerns, which are reflected by my constituents, regarding the cooling-off period of 12 months.It is simply not sufficient to stop this perceived revolving door between politicians elected to represent the public and lobbyists employed to represent private corporations. That well-oiled highway is failing the people and needs to come to an end. It undermines confidence in politics and public trust in these Houses.

Notwithstanding the amendment I have moved, I will work with her to address the issues she has raised in respect of the Bill. I acknowledge that Deputy Nash has also brought forward legislation in respect of the lobbying Act. I propose to outline some background detail regarding the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015. I consider this important in providing an overall context to the Bill. The Act was commenced on 1 September 2015. I acknowledge the work of the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, in bringing forward that legislation in the role I now occupy. From that date, there has been a requirement for those who lobby designated public officials, DPOs, to register and report on their lobbying activities every four months on the register of lobbying. The register, which is a web-based system, can be viewed at lobbying.ie and is overseen by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO. The lobbying website also includes a suite of information tools designed by the commission to help lobbyists, DPOs and the public to understand the Act and its obligations fully. Currently, almost 2,100 organisations or individuals have registered their lobbying activity on the register and almost 47,500 returns are available to view. Part 4 of the Act, which provides for investigation and enforcement provisions, was commenced on 1 January 2017. The time lag between the commencement of the Act and the commencement of these provisions was to provide persons who engage in lobbying with adequate time to familiarise themselves with the new legislative requirements, in terms of both the requirement to register and the requirement to provide ongoing returns, prior to the investigation and enforcement provisions coming into effect. Section 2 of the Act requires that the operation of the Act be reviewed every three years, as was noted earlier. The aim of this provision is to provide regular opportunities to assess the operation of the legislation and identify whether significant and substantial amendments may be required. To date, two statutory reviews have been carried out and public consultations were conducted on both occasions. The final reports were laid before these Houses. The second statutory review commenced in early 2019 and the subsequent report was published in January 2020. The review found that there is widespread acceptance and support for the legislation, with the Act and the register viewed in a positive and constructive light. The issues raised in the 27 submissions received as part of the public consultation process concerned mainly implementation and procedural matters, with a focus on a perceived need for more guidance on the implementation and interpretation of certain aspects of the Act. The proposed amendments to the Act generally concerned issues that had been examined in detail at the time of drafting of the legislation and its passage through the Oireachtas, and the Act reflects the result of that process. The review report concluded that the amendment of the existing legislation should be considered only where a compelling business case for change is clear and unequivocal; that the relatively short period of time for which the legislation has been operational is a further consideration in the context of determining whether amendment of the Act is required; and that where issues highlighted through the public consultation process have not been dealt with, they are capable of being effectively managed and resolved on an administrative basis by SIPO without the need to amend the Act. While the report of the second statutory review did not recommend that any amendment be made to the Act, it set out a number of recommended further actions for SIPO to consider, most of which relate to the requests received in submissions for greater clarity, guidance and education. It is clear from the submissions to both statutory reviews that the Act and the lobbying regulations it introduced have been well received and are now accepted as the norm, which is important. The Act is generally perceived to have met the intended objective of increasing transparency and accountability in respect of the lobbying of DPOs, underpinned by a register that is easily accessible and navigable. In this regard, I compliment the work of SIPO, particularly with regard to the significant volume of guidance notes, content on lobbying.ie and information notices, as well as the tailored outreach it conducts. The next scheduled statutory review is due to commence in early 2022 and will again involve a public consultation. The review must be published no later than the end of February 2023. I will now turn to the specific context of section 22 of the Act. This section, which restricts certain officeholders and certain public officials from engaging in lobbying in certain circumstances for a year after they leave office or employment, has been a focus of attention in recent times. In its submissions to both the first and second statutory reviews, SIPO recommended that section 22 be amended to provide that failure to comply with the section, with respect to either submitting an application for consent where required or complying with the commission's decision on an application for consent, should be a relevant contravention under section 18 of the Act and an offence under section 20 of the Act. As Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach indicated in the House in late September that a review of section 22 of the Act was to be undertaken by my Department, and this work is well advanced. I am committed to finding a resolution to the issues surrounding section 22. If there is a stipulation in law, there should be a proportionate penalty for those who do not adhere to that stipulation. Not having such penalties has the potential to undermine the relevance or spirit of such provisions in legislation. Reviewing section 22, however, presents challenges. While there are no enforcement provisions associated with breaches of the section, any potential legislative amendment to provide for sanctions for breaches of section 22 has to factor in issues such as the right of a person to work and the proportionality of any limitations and sanctions that may be imposed. It will also be important to ensure that any amendment to the current arrangements in respect of section 22 would not have the unintended impact of deterring participation in politics or public service roles, particularly those in positions of short to medium-term duration. On this basis, section 22 currently applies to a select cohort who are defined as "relevant designated public official[s]" under the Act. The Bill also proposes significant changes to other sections of the Act, and not just section 22. Some of the issues covered were also raised by SIPO in its submission to both of the statutory reviews thus far conducted. Given the substantial overlap between the Bill before us, the Labour Party Bill introduced earlier this month by Deputy Nash and the previous recommendations of SIPO to the two statutory reviews of the Act, I have decided to extend the remit of the review under way in my Department regarding section 22 of the Act to give renewed consideration to the issues raised in the Bill and other matters. As a relatively new Minister in the Department, I want to have a fresh look at the changes recommended by SIPO. I have reviewed them, and while I quite readily agree with many of them, others require more careful examination.I will bring my proposals to Government and to the House as soon as that work is completed. I expect they will be ready fairly shortly. Amendment No. 1, which proposes a waiting period of nine months before the Bill is deemed to be read a Second Time, will give my Department sufficient time to complete this extended review of section 22 and the further issues raised in the two Bills. More broadly, under the programme for Government, we are committed to a wider and more ambitious reform agenda. The Government will update and consolidate the ethics in public office legislation and undertake a review of electoral laws to ensure that donations and resources from outside the State are not being used to influence our elections and political process. The Government will also update our whistle-blowing legislation. Taken together, these measures will underpin public confidence in the administration of government in our country. I am committed to the Government's reform agenda and to acting on this particular matter. I look forward to bringing proposals to Government and to the House once the review I have outlined is complete.

I commend my colleagues, Teachtaí Mairéad Farrell and Doherty, on bringing forward this very important legislation. My party was forced to propose these amendments to the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 following recent behaviour by Fine Gael politicians, in particular, which has brought to the fore the flaws in the current system. We have witnessed the former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Brian Hayes, walk out the door of that Department and in the door of a banking lobby group. We then saw another former Minister of State at the same Department, Michael D'Arcy, resign from the Seanad to take up a job with the Irish Association of Investment Managers. There are other examples. This cosy club of politicians and lobbyists is something with which most people are, rightly, uncomfortable. It is a revolving door that Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have sought to keep open over the years. The golfgate event during the summer highlighted the problem once again. Ireland is a small place. Here was a former Minister of State, now a banking lobbyist, mingling with Ministers, Senators, a Commissioner and a Supreme Court judge at a private knees-up. It stank of the rotten politics of the past and reminded people of the problems that still exist and which must be challenged and changed. There is a clear need for a defined separation mechanism to ensure that former Ministers cannot trade on their previous insider knowledge to their own benefit or that of a lobbying organisation and at a cost to the public. This Bill will implement 13 recommendations made by the Standards in Public Office Commission to the Government in 2019. It will increase the cooling-off period for which Ministers, Ministers of State, special advisers and high-ranking civil servants must wait before moving from office to the lobbying sector. It will allow SIPO to investigate and sanction breaches of that requirement. It will also give SIPO the power to investigate and sanction persons or bodies that avoid their obligations under the Act, such as by destroying records, emails or text messages. One must question why anyone would object to these provisions. SIPO has called for legislative changes since 2016 to increase its investigative and sanctioning powers, broaden the scope of the Act and tighten up certain definitions. We need immediate action to close the revolving door between politics and vested interests. The politics of the golden circle, the politics of the nod and the wink and the politics of who one knows rather than what one knows must end now. This Bill will go some way towards achieving that.

There has a been much anger in recent months about the behaviour by, and friendships of, certain members of the Government. Big businesses, developers and speculators have always had a direct line to Ministers and senior Government officials. I am currently helping a family of two adults and seven children who are forced to live in a three-bedroom house. Two of the children have special needs. If their case had been discussed at the Oireachtas golf outing, would they still be stuck living like this? Another woman I am working with has a child who suffered a brain injury at only eight months old. She has another child with autism spectrum disorder. She is living in seriously overcrowded conditions and it is damaging her children's mental health and well-being. If she could have sent a text to the Tánaiste asking for a house, rather than a confidential document, would an approval confirmation have been couriered over to her? I am also in contact with a mother who has serious mental health issues that are being made worse by her living conditions. She has been on the housing list for eight and a half years and is waiting five years for her landlord to repair a leaking roof in her building. If only the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage were to become a chief lobbyist for her, as a former Minister of State at the Department of Finance did for the banks. I understand the frustration ordinary people are experiencing with the housing situation. Nine years go, I proposed that 800 houses be built on the Old Whitechurch Road in Cork - the Minister knows the location - to help address the housing crisis in the city. I put forward that proposal at a meeting of Cork City Council, not at a fancy dinner party, and, unfortunately, it fell on deaf ears. Parents are contacting me because their children are waiting for assessments of needs and to access services. The vulture funds did not have to wait. We need to put a stop to unfair lobbying and the practice of Government cosying up to big businesses and developers. Such activity harms ordinary people. They are the people we should be listening to and for whom we should be acting.

Any Bill that improves the accountability of Government and protects the public interest must be welcomed. The current situation of revolving doors and free hall passes for former Ministers and senior officials to move with ease between public office and lobbying roles, having gained valuable inside information, must be addressed. The consequences of fobbing off this Bill to a review will further erode public confidence in the integrity of democracy and governmental decision-making. We have already had two reviews, in 2016 and 2019, which failed in their feeble attempts to change the process. The situations of Brian Hayes and Michael D'Arcy are prime examples of that failure. The public wants the immediate strengthening of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015. The provisions set out in this Bill will make sure that transparency and accountability are to the fore. For too long, lobbyists were able to avoid their obligations under the current legislation, including by destroying records, text messages and emails. For too long, lobbyists were obliged only to have regard to the code of conduct rather than having to adhere strictly to it. This Bill will give the power to SIPO to investigate and sanction persons or bodies that destroy records. It will give SIPO the power to publish an anonymised summary of the details of investigations of breaches of the legislation. Most important, the Bill will extend to two years the period before which high-ranking civil servants, Ministers, Ministers of State and Government officials can switch to a lobbying role for big corporations and powerful individuals. The Bill will have a positive outcome for democracy and transparency. It will prevent the possibility of members of Government, advisers and officials seeking out lobbyists who can provide a position to justify their pre-chosen actions for the benefit of themselves or their vested interests. I would expect Members on all sides of the House to support the Bill in the full interest of the public, whom we all serve.

That perception is not helped by the situation concerning Mr. Justice Séamus Woulfe and the golfgate event. There is also the situation of the former Ministers of State at the Department of Finance, Brian Hayes and Michael D'Arcy. None of that helps in any way, shape or form. I join colleagues in commending Deputies Mairéad Farrell and Doherty on bringing forward this Bill. There is no need for a review such as the Minister has proposed. The Bill makes provision for 13 of the 22 recommendations made by SIPO itself. Its purpose is to introduce necessary transparency and accountability. It could be said that the Government requires this legislation more than we on this side of the House do insofar as it needs to sell itself and address the perception that a cosy cartel is in operation. The requirement for a cooling-off period between situations where people have ministerial office with real power and sway and finding themselves on the other side of a lobbying operation is well supported. I could probably forgive a great deal of what goes on if we had a Government and State that was delivering for everybody in terms of the provision of housing, healthcare and all the wants and needs of people in this country. I might accept it if we could all get insurance at a decent cost instead of being absolutely crippled with it, if people were not paying huge rents and could afford mortgages, and if all the other issues were addressed.That is accepting the particular situation we find ourselves in now as regards Covid-19, which, obviously, creates logistical difficulties. While I recognise that puts added pressure on the Government, it would be much better off dealing with this than dealing with the side issues on which it has caught itself up. In its attempt to protect itself, the Government would be far better putting its hands up and having the likes of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, coming in here and answering questions, and then we would get on with it. It is as simple as that. We want the State to work. People want the State to work. They want it to work for them. In relation to that, I will commend when the State apparatus works. I commend what happened today in Dundalk, where the Criminal Assets Bureau along with local gardaí, on work started by the local drug squad, carried out a huge operation where they seized drugs and money, and there will be a follow-up. That is not an entire answer in relation to that but it is to be commended. We need the Government to act. We need a fit-for-purpose situation. We need enforcement powers for SIPO. That is just it. This is simple and it could be done.

No doubt it will not be the last. There will be many more. I am glad to say that the Labour Party supports this Bill. This is a Bill that we can unite on. It is absolutely essential in terms of ensuring that there is the maximum confidence in politics and in how we govern this country. My party has a long, proud and unique track record on ethics legislation in this country. In the 1980s we stood almost alone against corruption in local government and the poisoning and corrupting influence of big money on politics and governance in this country. In the 1990s we produced Ireland's first major suite of legislation on ethics in public life. We shone a light on how government is conducted and on how decisions are made in our name and on our behalf when we introduced freedom of information legislation in the mid-1990s. In 2015, as the Minister has graciously acknowledged, my colleague, then Minister, Deputy Howlin, after bringing in stringent limits to the amount of cash that an individual politician or a party could receive as a donation, then went on to bring in laws and regulations to govern and regulate the system of lobbying in this country. Ireland had been, as we all know, notorious for being a country where things were done because of who one knew, not what one knew or the power or authority of the case that one made. We wanted to change not only that practice but the culture too. Of course, one citizen's lobbying is another's advocacy. For some, big businesses lobby while NGOs advocate. Lobbying is a fact of life, and executed to the letter and spirit of the 2015 Regulation of Lobbying Act, it can contribute to a better understanding for all of us of complex issues before we make important decisions. In a republic, all citizens, even those with whom we disagree, are entitled to be heard. The point is the process needs to be conducted on a level playing field where we know who is lobbying whom, for what purpose and, indeed, how frequently, and this is what the 2015 Act sought to achieve. The legislation has to a degree served us well, as has the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, but it can only enforce the laws that this House gives it. It is timely now, after almost five years of this legislation being in existence and over three years of the operation of the Act, that we identify where the gaps are in practice and seek to plug those gaps and address the lacuna that are there. It is crucial for transparency in our system of lobbying regulation and it is critical for confidence in our political system and in our institutions. This Bill before us this evening, as has been said by a multiplicity of contributors, is a straightforward attempt to legislate to deal with some of the shortcomings in the Act, many of which have been identified by SIPO itself in its annual reviews. I do not plan to comment on all of the measures proposed here other than to say that many are overdue and some, in my view, are more urgent than others. There is a strong case, for example, for the code of conduct that has been referenced earlier on to be given more weight and, arguably, for it to be placed on a statutory footing. This would help in terms of enforcement where breaches occur. Changes to the scope of the Act as it applies to coalitions of business interests are absolutely necessary. Of course, this must avoid any unintended consequences such as, for example, of holding coalitions of NGOs to the same legal standards as the financial services industry or, to name another active sector on the business side, groups of fossil fuel firms. The role of designated officials in supporting the Act is an important one and it needs attention. I have been lobbied, as has everyone else in this House, by countless organisations over the years. I remember being lobbied a couple of years ago by an organisation that everybody, even if one was not familiar with them, will be familiar with now - the National Association of General Practitioners, GPs - only to find when I checked that it did not record the engagement in its lobbying returns. For clarity, that meeting was in relation to the implementation of measures contained in the 2017 Competition (Amendment) Act, a Bill that was developed by me and my colleague, Senator Bacik. The Act certainly needs to be beefed up in this regard. The idea that designated public officials such as Oireachtas Members could be supported to bring to the attention of SIPO lobbying that does not happen in the context of the regulations we have at present, where breaches may occur or where it is unsatisfactory, is an important innovation and something we need to be conscious of. We need to be empowered to notify SIPO when we are not happen with how somebody conducts his or her business and where he or she is not in compliance, in our view, with the letter and spirit of the legislation. That would support good practice for everybody and send a message that bad behaviour would not be tolerated. We have known, as SIPO has recorded, that section 22 is open to abuse and needs to be enhanced. The case of the recent former Minister of State tunnelling his way from these Houses three months after leaving office to a new gig lobbying for the sector for which he had policy responsibility and with no effort whatsoever to engage with the relevant authority in advance is proof, if we needed it, that our laws on lobbying and post-term employment need to be reviewed. The Minister acknowledged that and has done so time and again. The Minister has acknowledged that I published a Bill in this regard, and he referenced that earlier on. The proposed change to section 22 in my proposals would give the Standards in Public Office Commission the power to investigate and sanction former politicians who breach lobbying and ethics rules. My Bill also provides for penalties, including a class C of up to €2,500 and up to two years in prison, for anyone found to have been in breach of section 22. There is widespread public concern, as has been acknowledged in the House time and again, at the revolving door between former Government members and the financial services sector, for example, and to what is now, in my view, a cavalier attitude to the practice of lobbying. Our experience of the 2015 Act tells us that investigatory and enforcement powers in respect of section 22 are required, that contravention of that section should be deemed to be a relevant contravention under section 18 and an actual offence under section 20 of the Act, and also that the Commission must be empowered to investigate former politicians and officials post term. We cannot separate the issue of lobbying and ethics in public life from the question of big money in politics. The annual donations report from SIPO was published today. Mr. Michael Brennan writes this evening in the Business Post online that, "Voters will be astonished to learn that the country's political parties only managed to attract €175,000 in disclosed donations last year." Astonished, they must be. "Disclosed donations" is the operative phrase. We know now, as a result of questions I put to the Standards in Public Office Commission, that the €4 million left to Sinn Féin by the late William Hampton was expressly left to Sinn Féin in this State but was politically laundered in the North to avoid the gaze of the authorities here.Our laws prohibit accepting any donations above €2,500. This €4 million was a hundred times more than the figure of just over €40,000 that that party declared in donations for 2019. This is a stroke that would have made the late Charles Haughey blush.

What this practice does is lay bare the inadequacies of our political funding laws, which need to be reformed to catch up with such practices. I very much welcome this legislation. It is an important contribution to reforming ethics legislation in this country. However, we need to do much more to ensure that not only do we deal with lobbying, but that we focus on financing of political parties. We also need reforms to how we govern elections, which is a job the programme for Government identifies for a new electoral commission. This issue needs to be addressed holistically and comprehensively in a suite of legislation that will bring up to date the laws we introduced a number of years ago to ensure they are up to speed and are dealing with the practices we have identified in this House and elsewhere in recent times. We need to address this because we have practices going on that are corrosive to politics and this democracy. They need to be addressed, and in a united fashion. I will support the work Deputies Doherty and Mairéad Farrell are doing. I will support any Member of this House who wants to that and do it honestly, openly and fairly because we need to ensure we have a level playing pitch for the way politics is conducted in this country.

The purpose of the Bill is to allow for the implementation of several recommendations made by the Standards in Public Office Commission in 2019. At the time SIPO made a number of recommendations to improve and strengthen transparency and accountability in public office. Unfortunately, the Government of the time chose to ignore these recommendations. I remember raising them with then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I was told that now was not the time to consider amending this legislation, whatever that meant. I tell the Minister there is no better time than now and I hope he will take this legislation, and indeed the comments of various Members of this House, on board. This legislation is much-needed and already overdue, given that the original recommendations were made more than 18 months ago. We need to go much further, however. While this legislation proposes some much-needed reforms for those holding public office, Ireland still does not have an effective means of preventing, detecting and prosecuting corruption and white-collar crime. Various tribunals, commissions and Oireachtas inquiries have come and gone with few consequences for corrupt and reckless behaviour. Although this legislation goes some way towards addressing the long-standing revolving door between politics and the private sector, it really only scratches the surface when it comes to corruption and white-collar crime in this country. Anti-corruption law is spread across a range of legislation and responsibility for preventing and prosecuting corruption is likewise spread across a number of different agencies. Piecemeal reforms in recent years have fallen very far short of what is needed to protect Government decision-making from being unduly influenced by vested interests. While I welcome this legislation we need to go much further if we are serious about rectifying these wrongs. One of the most annoying aspects of public life in this country is that when poor behaviour or suspected corruption takes place the response is inevitably to set up some kind of inquiry. There are so many different examples of various tribunals, commissions and inquiries that were established and in many cases went on for years and many of which heard evidence about serious corruption and yet because our laws have been so weak, we ended up, after spending much time and an awful lot of money, with nobody being held accountable. That really damages confidence in politics and it would have been better in some cases if nothing had been done about those breaches of standards because it really is very demoralising for people to see that kind of thing and see that there is no real appetite at a political level, certainly at Government level, to take this on. We need to learn from that and we have a responsibility to our own citizens. These problems have been highlighted on several occasions by international bodies, including the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, and still there has been no reaction to that. Successive Governments have failed to take this issue seriously. The Social Democrats first proposed the setting up of an independent anti-corruption agency in a motion brought to this House almost five years ago. I want to take this opportunity to stress again how badly needed this is in Irish politics and public life. Our detailed proposals are based on international best practice and cover corruption in both the public and private sphere. Without a dedicated and properly-resourced agency we will continue to see a range of laws on our Statute Book which may or may not meet international standards but which lead to few actual consequences for corrupt behaviour. That being said, I want to express the Social Democrats’ support for the measures contained in this legislation. The Bill seeks to incorporate into its remit representative bodies which do not have full employees as well as informal coalitions which are engaged in lobbying. This is an important measure because it captures lobbying activity which may be conducted informally - on the golf course, over a few pints, after bumping into somebody or when people’s paths cross in social settings. Lobbying activity in all of these situations still seeks to influence political decision-making and that is particularly the case given the small size of this country and also the fact that there are such close connections between politics and business. The measures in the Bill which relate to investigation and reporting are particularly important. The Social Democrats fully support the measures, which widen the commission’s ability to investigate and report on breaches of the code of conduct and contraventions of the Act. However, powers to investigate should go further and we believe the commission should be resourced fully to conduct thorough spot checks of a proportion of all lobbying returns filed. It should be enabled to name and shame lobbyists who contravene the law by publishing its investigation reports and doing that at an early date. Spot checks would give the commission, as well as the public, a better picture of overall compliance and would also ensure a better level of compliance out of fear, if nothing else. Of particular importance are the Bill’s provisions around cooling-off periods which it extends from one to two years. Most important, the Bill makes failure to comply with cooling-off periods a contravention and it allows the commission to publish details in its annual report about any successful applications to waive a cooling-off period. Let us not forget that earlier this year a Fine Gael Senator resigned from the Seanad to lead a lobby group for financial investment companies. One could not make it up. The revolving door between politics and private businesses jeopardises transparency and accountability in politics and it is a practice which must stop if we, as politicians, expect the public to have trust in our politics. Without real enforcement powers there is no way to ensure this practise will not continue unchecked. This type of enforcement and reporting is very badly needed.I want to touch on the provision to allow the commission to direct a designated public official to cease communication with a lobbyist or lobby group that is non-compliant with the Act. This goes back to the importance of enforceability. To date, the Act has, unfortunately, been treated by some politicians as more of a guideline than a rule. This type of behaviour is extremely harmful to public office. The stronger enforcement measures contained in the Bill would be a step in the right direction to strengthening accountability. However, the Bill and these recommendations from SIPO are just one part of the big picture. The fact is that Ireland needs a major overhaul in how it deals with corruption and white-collar crime. There is nothing more dispiriting to law-abiding citizens than seeing people who are engaged in corruption, whether it is at the level of business, politics or the public sector, walking away scot-free, and we have too many examples of this in our recent history. This goes back to what I mentioned earlier about the need for an independent anti-corruption agency, which needs to be properly resourced and enabled to oversee legislation and agencies throughout the public service. The current piecemeal approach to responsibility is just not working. There is a lot of work to be done in this area. There is a responsibility on politicians and Ministers if they are serious about restoring confidence in public life and the public sphere. There is an onus on anybody who is serious about this to restore confidence. Unless we are prepared to show we are serious about tackling this, unless we are prepared to out colleagues in the House who contravene the existing legislation, and unless we are prepared to bring in a meaningful agency with teeth that is properly resourced, we are never going to get to the bottom of this.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	485	It was James Connolly who wrote that governments in capitalist society are but committees of the rich to manage the affairs of the capitalist class. He was 100% correct. He was actually popularising what Marx and Engels had written in The Communist Manifesto, stating the executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie. That was back in 1848. Very many things have changed about the world since 1848 but that essential truth about the role of capitalist governments remains. One of the things that has developed since that period of time is precisely the massive industry of big business lobbying. It is immense. It is big business in and of itself. I remember from my time in the European Parliament that there are 30,000 lobbyists in Brussels. There are something like three lobbyists for every member of staff in the European Parliament. They lobby overwhelmingly for big corporations or the likes of the European Round Table of Industrialists, which is like IBEC taken to a European level. Billions of euro are involved in lobbying on specific legislation for amendments and in general. Of course, there is lobbying by big business here too and evidently it works. These private companies that are interested in the pursuit of maximisation of profit would not spend the money on being part of these lobbying organisations if they did not feel they got a return for their investment. The way it works is, in essence, to transmit from these businesses, via these lobbying organisations or directly, the interests of big business. People can say that is great and part of the democratic process but the problem is that most people do not have that access. The ability of the vast majority of people to impact on the policy of government is either through participating in voting or by using their collective power by going on strike, organising their community, pressurising from below or demonstrating. The vast majority of people do not have the capacity to pay for access the way big business does. It is a perversion of any notion of basic democracy whenever big business lobbyists are able to have the influence they have. We have seen the revolving door in politics, big business and lobbying spin extremely rapidly in this country over the past while. It epitomises this process. It works on a level of immediate interest but also more generally in terms of shaping the outlook of an establishment elite layer in Irish society that shares a common outlook and common viewpoint that is, generally speaking, at one with the interests of the very rich and big business in our society. Obviously, the example has been given repeatedly, because it is a very good example, of Brian Hayes going from being a Fine Gael MEP to the head of the banking lobbyists' organisation and, even more blatantly, Michael D'Arcy going from Minister of State with responsibility for the financial sector to being CEO of the Irish Association of Investment Managers. It is definitely worth asking the question as to why these people got these jobs. It is nothing personal. I do not have any personal problem with either Brian Hayes or Michael D'Arcy and I am not casting any doubt on their talents but I do not think they got their jobs because they are the smartest people in the country. I do not think they got their jobs because they are the people with the highest level of experience in banking and investment management. I do not think that explains why they got their jobs. I do not think their CVs would suggest long experience in lobbying because obviously they do not have experience in lobbying. So why were they chosen for these, presumably, very well paid jobs? The answer is very simple. They were chosen because of their former jobs. They were chosen precisely because Brian Hayes was an MEP and a leading Fine Gael politician and Michael D'Arcy similarly. They were chosen for the access they provide and that is very literal access. Former Deputies can drive through the front gates of Leinster House and the ushers will let them in to park in the car park alongside all of the current Deputies. They can stride through the corridors of Leinster House meeting Ministers and politicians and whoever they want along the way and stop them for a friendly chat. They can go into the Dáil restaurant and the canteen and sit down and have a chat. The lobbyists get literal access to the halls of power by having people such as this. There is also metaphorical access in that these people know the people who are in power. If those people are out of power for a while then, all things being normal in Irish politics, which hopefully they will not be, they will be back in power again so they are very good people, who have the phone numbers of the people they want to be able to talk to and they are able to get access. When the banks are sitting down and negotiating with the Government they think it is very helpful, and I suspect they are right and that is why they pay for it, to have a politician on their side of the table who knows the politicians on the other side of the table and, therefore, there is a rapport and a willingness to listen to each other and take each other seriously as opposed to a more formal relationship. Again, I emphasise the fact they pay for this for a reason and make these choices for a reason and it is not explicable, in my opinion, without that point of access. People generally got a glimpse behind the curtain in terms of how the establishment operates in this country over the past number of months. The immediate issue with golfgate was the outrage of people at the behaviour of these people at the time of a pandemic, which was undermining the public health effort, but people also got a sense that this is how power works. At Oireachtas golf society events there is dinner afterwards were people drink, eat and enjoy themselves, and who is there at these tables but politicians, lobbyists and judges all there together. It is not to suggest there are some brown envelopes or something going back and forth but that is not how it has to work.It is the formation of a common viewpoint whereby these people view the world in a certain way together and have a class identity together which, in my opinion, is counterposed to the class interest of the majority of ordinary people. At the core of that is the elevation of private profit of the banks, of the corporations and of the others who are represented there. There are other examples. The #leotheleak scandal also demonstrated a different kind of way that access works, whereby the head of the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, was able to get access to a document that the current Tánaiste agreed he should not have had access to. It was a confidential document, as was very clear, in my opinion. However, he got access to it because of who he was and how he knew the then Taoiseach. At the very same time that took place, the paramedics organised in the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, were on a picket line to try to be recognised and be formally negotiated with. They did not have any special access whatsoever - nothing like that - and they had to fight for it. It highlights the difference between being an insider and being an outsider and having to fight to be heard. Adding insult to injury is what has happened around the appointment of Geraldine Feeney to the Standards in Public Office Commission. Again, it is nothing personal. I do not know Geraldine Feeney and I do not have any reason to doubt her sincerity, impartiality or anything else like that. However, it is fundamentally extremely problematic. I have made a complaint to SIPO. I believe that the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, was in clear breach of the codes of conduct for Deputies and office holders. I presume that is the first, second or third complaint, or certainly an early complaint, on the desk of SIPO to investigate. Then, a person is appointed to the board after the board was left sitting two people short for a period of months. It was the case that finally - great - the positions were being filled, but then, it is someone who was formerly a lobbyist for the NAGP, the organisation that is due to be investigated. It is just incredible. It is mind-blowing stuff, in my opinion. Even if we look at the rules of SIPO, it is not possible for her to recuse herself from the investigation. She has to step aside from all the work of SIPO while the investigation is going on, and someone else will have to be appointed in any case if she is not to participate. I do not see on what basis that can happen. I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward the Bill, which I support.

Power and money tend to go hand in hand. We used to see it in the Galway races tent, and we still see it at fancy Covid restriction-breaking golf dinners and in the golden circle, the inner sanctum, and the revolving door of politicians, lobbyists, Attorneys General and Supreme Court judges. It is all about who knows who, and who can influence policy. It is such a shame, is it not? Politics was supposed to have become more transparent and accountable. The days of the brown envelopes were supposed to have been behind us while corporate interests were expected to document and detail their meetings with public officials when seeking to influence policy. Unfortunately, many loopholes exist in the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, an Act that is yet another example of the Government paying lip service to an important issue without giving it the teeth to impose sanctions and prosecute for breaches of the Act. If a group does not have any paid staff, it does not have to complete the thrice yearly lobbying returns. If a chairperson or director undertakes the lobbying, they do not have to report it at all. With all legislation, we should welcome the opportunity to review it once a period of commencement and implementation has passed. We should be willing to reflect critically on the positives and the unintended consequences and to address any loopholes that were uncovered from commencement. It is ridiculous that we are still so reactive and have to wait until a story hits the media before we do something about it. The recent case is that of Michael D'Arcy from Wexford. A former long-standing Fine Gael politician, Michael D'Arcy lost his seat in the general election in February 2020 and he was subsequently successful in his bid for a seat on the agriculture panel in the Seanad. Previously, as a Deputy, Michael D'Arcy was a member of the Oireachtas banking inquiry committee and he was also a Minister of State at the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, with special responsibility for financial services and insurance. As a Member of the Twenty-sixth Seanad, Michael D'Arcy spoke on a number of items of legislation, including the Investment Limited Partnerships (Amendment) Bill 2020. On the Second Stage of the debate on this Bill, on 23 September, the then Senator Michael D'Arcy opened his speech by saying:Sometimes we describe a Bill as a very technical piece of legislation or as boring. Unfortunately, this type of thing is boring, but we have to get through it, and the devil is very much in the detail in this case. We are talking about the private equity sector in respect of financial services for Ireland. As the Minister of State will be aware, the financial services sector is quite a large employer, of about 16,000 people currently. The sector has been arguing, for about four and a half to five years, that without this legislation it cannot advance the private equity side of investment in Ireland.On Monday, 28 September 2020, just five days after his Seanad speech, the Irish Association of Investment Managers, IAIM, announced that it had "appointed former Minister of State with Responsibility for Financial Services, Michael D'Arcy as its new CEO". It was not so boring then. The official statement on its website states:Mr D'Arcy will work closely with IAIM Chairman, John Corrigan, on the development of the IAIM strategic plan in the context of the challenges and opportunities facing the investment management industry. In his role as CEO, Mr D'Arcy will be responsible for re-setting the IAIM agenda and priorities, given the changing landscape post-Brexit. When the expected furore happened over this appointment, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste said that Michael D'Arcy probably should have contacted SIPO, the Standards in Public Office Commission, to speak to it prior to resigning his post as a designated public official and taking up a chief executive role. He also should have adhered to the one-year cooling-off period before taking up such a post. The Taoiseach has ordered a review of the legislation to be carried out and Michael D'Arcy said he would not be involved in lobbying for his first year on the job. In response, Sinn Féin has brought forward this welcome Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020. This is not just about Michael D'Arcy as there are many instances of concern. Even more recently, the Government appointed Ms Geraldine Feeney to the board of SIPO. Ms Feeney was previously a lobbyist for the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP. We all remember that name as it was the NAGP's former president, Dr. Ó Tuathail, who was sent confidential documents by then Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. We can see why people talk about revolving doors and golden circles. I welcome this Bill and I will be supporting it. The Bill seeks to amend the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 and will amend a number of sections of that Act. These amendments will provide for the implementation of some of the recommendations set out in the second legislative review of the Act by SIPO. Sections 11, 16, 18, 22 and 25 of the 2015 Act will be amended and a new section will be inserted relating to the duties of designated public officials. Of the 22 recommendations put forward in SIPO's second review, this Sinn Féin Bill would provide for the implementation of 12 of them. It is a pity that not all of the 22 recommendations are being brought forward. However, it is more disappointing that many sections of the SIPO review which was published in May 2019 state that these recommendations were put forward previously in its first review. Again, why must the Government always govern in a haphazard way? In this case, is it to wait and see what it can get away with, without being held to account?

I will certainly be supporting it. I want to refer to the second statutory review of the Regulation of Lobbying Act. The Minister's predecessor said we did not need to do anything, and that was in January of this year. If the current Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is to bring in another approach, I welcome that, but it is November and it was only in January last that it was said there was no need to change the legislation. That is particularly worrying because the then Minister in January talked about bringing transparency, and he stated "that transparency of interest representation is key to allowing citizens to track the activities and potential influence of those who lobby". Later in the document, he said there was no need for any changes and stated "the amendment of any legislation should only be considered where a compelling business case for change is clear and unequivocal". I presume the current Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, does not agree with that. It was only in January of this year that the Department and the then Minister said they did not need change and that the few changes that are required could be done on an administrative basis. That was a blatant denial of what SIPO said in its second report and its first report. I appreciate the Minister's bona fides on this matter.In his contribution he moved on a little from the position in September where he was simply reviewing section 22. He is now reviewing more of that, which is welcome, but that has been brought about by the Sinn Féin Bill before the House. That is very upsetting when the Minister talks about learning and doing things differently. We set up SIPO, which I would not describe as ultra-radical. Would the Minister? It is moderate, reasonable and rational and it produced a detailed report containing 22 recommendations. It set out where the legislation was inadequate and asked for changes to that. It said that it had already pointed that out in its first report and that it was pointing it out again, and so the Department, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, ignores it all. It took a Sinn Féin motion tonight to bring forward some of the recommendations. I thank that party's Members for using their Private Members' time for that. It has to be asked why we have to rely on an Opposition party, with the fewer resources available to us, to bring a Bill like this before the House when SIPO has clearly pointed out the absolute necessity for the Bill and the different recommendations, some of which were extremely basic, to allow it the right of investigation in respect of non-compliance with the code of conduct, to lay a code of conduct before the Dáil, to publish some reports and the details of some reports in the interest of fairness and in the interest of people who have been cited in the media of contravening the code when they have not? SIPO has pointed out clearly the downside of not publishing things. One would think that if a proactive Department and a proactive Minister were serious, they would deal with that. When we look at what is being asked in the different recommendations, as I said, they are extremely basic. In a 2019 submission SIPO stated:Earlier this year the Commission became aware of a possible breach of section 22 of the Act. Following correspondence with the person and the employer concerned the Commission was satisfied that section 22 of the Act had been contravened. The commission had no authority to investigate ... this breach of the Act. The above breach brings into sharp focus the lack of power to enforce the Act's post-employment provisions, or to impose sanctions for persons who fail to comply with these provisions.That is directly in regard to the revolving door and so on. We have a review that says we did not need any changes whatsoever. My time is up but there are many issues here. At this point all I can say is that if the Minister is going to do things differently he should remove the nine months. I always think of nine months as a pregnancy. We do not need another nine months to review this. We need the Minister to read the two reports from SIPO and the practical recommendations it made and to act on them.

I hope it is the first of many. I also thank all the other Deputies who contributed to the debate. The Bill before us provides for the amendment of six sections of the 27 sections of the Act. They are section 5 on the meaning of carrying on lobbying activities, section 11 on the details to be supplied by applications for inclusion on the register, section 16 on the code of conduct, section 18 on the relevant contraventions, section 22 on restrictions on post-term employment as a lobbyist, and section 25 on reports by the commission. The Bill also proposes the introduction of a new section to the Bill on the duties of designated public officials, DPOs. I will address section 22, restrictions on post-term employment as a lobbyist, first. Under section 22 of the Act, specific categories of DPOs, entitled relevant DPOs, are subject to a one-year cooling-off period during which they cannot engage in lobbying activities in specific circumstances or be employed by or provide services to a person carrying on lobbying activities in specific circumstances. The relevant DPOs covered by section 22 are Ministers of the Government and Ministers of State; a special adviser appointed under section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997; the grades of Secretary General, second secretary, deputy secretary, assistant secretary or director level in the Civil Service, together with equivalent professional and technical grades; and the posts of chief executive, assistant chief executive and director of service in local authorities. In respect of others who are defined as DPOs under the Act but are not covered by this section 22 provision, that is, TDs, Senators, MEPs and local authority members, the one-year cooling-off period does not apply to them. The cooling-off period applies for a full one year unless the relevant DPO applies to the Standards in Public Office Commission for consent to waive or reduce their cooling-off period. At the time, this approach was considered to represent a proportionate response to deal with the matter case by case rather than placing a mandatory blanket prohibition on relevant DPOs taking up particular roles which could be open to legal challenge by a person, for example, moving from a relevant DPO post in the public sector to a specific post in the private sector. The approach taken, as mentioned by the Minister, also sought to ensure that the measures would not have the unintended impact of deterring participation in politics or in public service roles, particularly those in positions of short to medium-term duration. It is a responsibility of the relevant DPO to seek consent from Standards in Public Office Commission to waive or reduce his or her cooling-off period prior to taking up an offer of employment or to provide relevant services in circumstances where such employment or services may be or may be perceived to be encompassed by section 22. The commission may decide to give consent unconditionally or give consent with conditions attached. The commission may also refuse to give consent for all or part of the cooling-off period. A relevant DPO who is unhappy with the decision of the commission may appeal. The Bill being discussed is proposing a number of amendments relating to section 22. It proposes, first, to make a contravention of section 22(1) of the Act relating to the cooling-off provision a relevant contravention under section 18 of the Act; second, to extend the cooling-off period from one to two years; and, third, to extend the scope of section 22 to include public bodies and DPOs with whom a person may have had significant involvement, influence or contacts. Such proposals raise complex issues. For example, as noted by the Minister in his opening statement, any potential legislative amendment to provide for sanction for breaches of section 22 has to factor into account issues such as the rights of a person to work and the proportionality of both any limitations and any sanctions that may be imposed. Longer cooling-off periods also raise issues around people's right to earn a living, proportionality and so on. Some other non-section 22 related proposed amendments in the Bill before us also give rise to complex issues. For example, the proposed amendment to section 5 relating to representative bodies provides that any business representative bodies or coalitions of business interests, irrespective of the number or status of employees, are within the scope of the Act where one or more of the members of the body or coalition would be within the scope if they were acting themselves. The Bill also provides that members of the body or coalition should be required to be named on returns to support increased transparency. At present, while representative bodies with one employee are captured by the regulation of lobbying legislation, where the representative body has no employees it is not required to register. The purpose of this exemption for no employees is to allow for small local groups such as a residents association to discuss local issues with a DPO without the requirement to register. It would be difficult to carve out these other sectoral representative bodies or coalitions without inadvertently bringing smaller local groups into the requirement to register. Other proposed amendments in the Bill before us, such as in regard to section 11, may be capable of implementation on an administrative basis by the Standards in Public Office Commission. As referenced earlier by the Minister, the Taoiseach indicated in the House in late September of this year that a review of section 22 of the Act was to be undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. This work is under way. In addition to consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, the review will include the following: consultation with and consideration of the views of the Standards in Public Office Commission; review of recent Private Members' Bills published regarding the matter, including the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020 being discussed and the issues raised by Members; and reflection on relevant proposals made in public submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of either the first 2017 or the second 2020 strategy reviews of the Act. As noted by the Minister in his opening statement, given the substantial overlap between the Bill and the previous recommendations of the Standards in Public Office Commission to the two statutory reviews of the Act, he has decided to extend the remit of the review currently under way regarding section 22 of the Act to give renewed consideration to the range of issues raised in the Bill and all the contributions of Members here this evening. The proposed time-limited amendment of nine months to the motion that the Bill be read a Second Time will provide the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a sufficient period to complete this extended review, which, as has been outlined, requires the consideration of complex issues. The Minister has stated his commitment to acting on the matter and, once the review is complete, to bringing forward proposals to the Government and then to the House. The Minister and I are therefore seeking an amendment that the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020 be deemed to be read a Second Time this day nine months to allow for, in the context of the operation of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, consideration of the SIPO recommendations for reform and the provisions of this and other Private Members' legislation in this area. The Minister and I oppose the completion of Second Stage should amendment No. 1 not be accepted.

Before I do so, I commend Deputy Mairéad Farrell on presenting her first Bill. It is something that I hope to do in due course. It is not exactly Deputy Doherty's first Bill but I extend that to him. I was struck by Deputy Farrell's earlier contention in a Sinn Féin press release that Fine Gael and this Government have done nothing in this area. I remind the House that it was indeed a Fine Gael-led Government that introduced the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 that is in operation now, an Act that I am quite familiar with as someone who used to give courses and lectures on this for another institution, before I was in elected politics or indeed in this House. As part of that, it was a Fine Gael Government that established a lobbyist register which is seen as the best model across Europe and has been copied by many member states of the European Union. We do not need to take lectures on such matters from Sinn Féin. The irony of Sinn Féin of all parties prematurely introducing this Bill should not be lost on anyone. The political opportunism is richly on display. Why is Sinn Féin so vociferous about pushing this Bill while it is so weak on it in Northern Ireland, where it opposed the Functioning of Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill? Why did Sinn Féin introduce legislation similar to this in Northern Ireland in 2017 but suddenly withdraw it? Why is Sinn Féin parading itself as the champion of transparency and public standards in Dublin when the opposite is true in Northern Ireland? However, such political duplicity from Sinn Féin when it suits it is nothing new. We still need to know who William Hampton was. Why did he leave Sinn Féin €4 million for political use in the Republic and where is Sinn Féin's justification for bypassing this State's donation laws by funnelling that money through its Northern office? Can Sinn Féin Members, in their remarks after this, confirm why they have not declared the use of Northern resources to pay for online advertising targeting Border counties such as Monaghan and Louth to SIPO? There is a murky history of political financing across this island. Fine Gael has proactively done something to end this scourge through the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, which places strict donation limits on individuals and corporate entities, as well as requiring registration with SIPO. What is the real purpose of tonight's Private Members' business? Is it really to implement reform and improve our political system or is it yet another opportunity for Sinn Féin to score cheap political points, while stonewalling on its own shortcomings where it is in power on this island? I commend the Minister's amendment and the continuing approach of this Government to review and improve this legislation as appropriate.

We recently had a vivid reminder of how it works, with the favour sought and given in the ever-decreasing circles around the Taoiseach, the most powerful office in this State. The man who now holds the office declared full confidence in the man who used to hold the office, who leaked confidential Government information. It seems that Government formation is an elite game to be played by elite players, decided on and chosen by themselves and each other. Lobbying can be a game in itself. It can be an extremely confusing game because the politician being lobbied today can be the person doing the lobbying tomorrow, especially when it comes to Fine Gael's Ministers of State at the Department of Finance, who can turn on a proverbial sixpence, as exemplified by Brian Hayes and Michael D'Arcy. It is a revolving door, going from running the Department of Finance to lobbying the Department of Finance on behalf of the banks that we bailed out. People need to be able to make a living after politics but they should not and must not be able to make that living immediately after coming out of the privilege of the contacts, experience, information, influence and access granted through working in government. Such activity demeans the idea of public office working equally for all people, not just the favourite few. It undermines any sense of equality of access to people and their offices when they make Government decisions and policy by which we, the citizens of this Republic, must live, but it is all right here. It is done brazenly in the face of the people. We do not have to make it up. Sinn Féin wants tighter controls on lobbying than currently exist. I commend my comrade, Deputy Mairéad Farrell, on her first Bill, which will implement the recommendations from SIPO. The old boys' club has been found out. The old way of saying that is how we do things around here must go.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	496	On 8 February, when voters went to the polls, a large proportion of them voted for a new direction. They voted for a new direction in housing policy. They voted for universal healthcare. They voted for the age of retirement to be maintained at 65. Above all, they voted for change. Part of that change undoubtedly meant a break from the old, stale insider politics that defined successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments. Following the election, those two parties, rather than recognising the appetite for change, came together to deny it. Far from breaking with the practices of the past, from the golden circles and the revolving doors, the practices of the past have instead become the hallmark of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael present. From the appointment of judges to the refusal of Ministers to hold themselves accountable to this Dáil, from the backroom deals with the bankers, vultures and insurance industry, to the sideroom deals that see some lobbyists get confidential documents from the heart of Government, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are carrying on as they always carried out, but now they are doing it together and arguably more blatantly than ever. Tonight, we can see that in plain sight. The Bill proposed by Deputies Mairéad Farrell and Pearse Doherty seeks to prevent a situation whereby Fine Gael Ministers of State at the Department of Finance can move seamlessly into lobbying roles for the bankers and vultures that they were supposed to regulate. It calls for a cooling-off period of just two years, hardly a punitive measure but vitally important if citizens are to have confidence that the decisions made by the Government are made in the public interest. In fact, this Bill provides for measures that the Standards in Public Office Commission has been calling for since 2003 in some instances. There have been several promises, pledges, considerations and reviews in the intervening years. The Government's response tonight is to have yet another review. It is not good enough. The Minister can try to obstruct and deny change and might even succeed for a while, but it will only be for a while, because the appetite for change has grown since February and will continue to grow every day until every revolving door has been shut and the rotten, shady, insider deals are brought to an end. I commend this Bill to the House.

Tá sé go maith le feiceáil nach bhfuil aon pháirtí i gcoinne na leasuithe seo ach is mór an trua é nach bhfuil an Rialtas sásta an Bille seo a chur i bhfeidhm láithreach. I welcome this debate and the fact that not one Member of the Oireachtas has opposed this. I am delighted that we have drafted legislation that goes across the political divide, with representatives agreeing that these changes must take place. I am also glad that this Bill will go to Committee Stage, although it will take another nine months if the Government's amendment passes tomorrow. The importance of this legislation and the public need for these changes has meant that we have not had a dissenting voice. That speaks loudly by itself. I welcome what the Minister said earlier, that he will be extending the review and not just focusing on section 22. I believe that we need to act on this right away and I suggest that the next step is pre-legislative scrutiny. If the Government lets it pass to pre-legislative scrutiny, then we are willing to work with the Government and it would not go any further while the Government is conducting that review. I ask the Government to consider that. I thank my Sinn Féin colleagues who have supported this tonight, as well as other Deputies across the House. I am glad to see that Sinn Féin is still living rent-free in Deputy Richmond's head.

That is absolutely correct. I want to go back to tonight's Bill. This should not be delayed any further. We saw a review in 2016 and we saw the SIPO recommendations. There was a review in 2019 and there were SIPO recommendations, but nothing was done. Fine Gael ignored it in 2016 and again in 2019. In February this year, Fine Gael again ignored it. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published its review, which called for more education and guidance as, apparently, there was no convincing case for updating these laws.Following this, SIPO released a statement stating that it was disappointed that none of its recommendations to enhance transparency and accountability were adopted. Since then we have seen major incidents which show the drastic need for change with regards to lobbying in this country. Another matter upon which I have written to the Ceann Comhairle, and I was grateful for his reply, is in respect of something that has been mentioned here earlier during this debate and concerns the fact that a former Member does not require an invitation to the Dáil for the purposes of lobbying. They can just use their swipe card to come and go as they please whereas another organisation, without that so-called privilege, would require an invitation. That is complete madness and once again creates an inequality and an elite which needs to change. Nobody, after having been elected to the Dáil, should get some sort of privilege which gives them greater access than another person when they leave this office.  We now have a situation where the Government wants another review. I urge the Minister to take on board the consideration that we discuss this further and let this Bill be brought further than this today. The question is why. We have already had two reviews and SIPO’s recommendations on what additional powers it requires. What we have not had is a proper enactment of the kind of recommendations that have flowed from these reviews.  Deputy Shortall said earlier that we need so much more anti-corruption measures. I see this Bill as a first but very important step in that regard. I would like us to work together to bring about those recommendations because they are essential, even just for public confidence in political life, which is so important. The last thing we need now is another can-kicking exercise which tries to avoid taking any actions by riding out the current new cycle and hoping that the public will forget all about this.  We need immediate action and to close the revolving door between vested interests and government and not more grease on the wheel. Unfortunately, it is the public who are left to carry the cost of this influence-peddling as our democratic process becomes corroded. We have a very reasonable Bill here that will deal with this and we are willing to work with the Minister on it. I urge him to reconsider his position to allow us to move this Bill on to pre-legislative scrutiny. Gabhaim buíochas.

The Ballybrophy to Limerick railway line is very important. It goes from Ballybrophy in south Laois down the whole way to Limerick city and has much more potential than its current use. Much investment has been made in this line in recent years, such as track upgrades, but the benefits of this to either the public, the environment or to Iarnród Éireann have not been realised. The line branches off in Ballybrophy and travels down through Roscrea, Cloughjordan, Nenagh, Birdhill, Castleconnell and Limerick city and connects up the three counties. The line could play an important role in the economic and social development of the southern part of Laois, particularly in places like Rathdowney, Borris-in-Ossory, Mountrath, Durrow and indeed in north Tipperary. My colleague, Deputy Martin Browne, from Tipperary will refer to that in a moment. Passenger numbers can be increased for work, tourism and shopping. At present, one train leaves Limerick at 7 a.m. for Ballybrophy. It sets off on the return journey back from Ballybrophy at 10 a.m. and arrives in Limerick at 12.05 p.m., but the train sits there all day and is unused until 4.55 p.m. when it sets off again on the just over two hour journey back to Ballybrophy.  To make better use of this line and train a number of low-cost actions need to happen. A company engineer needs to review and do a full report on line speeds and take account of the track upgrades that have been done to shorten journey times. All tracks, to my understanding, must be inspected every three years and have reports done, and this one has not been done for a number of years. A new timetable should be put in place for the train to leave Ballybrophy earlier in the morning and for the return train to leave Limerick after 5 p.m. which would facilitate workers and students. The option of putting on a midday train service should be looked at.

I am here to talk about the need for a better service on the Ballybrophy rail line. The Ballybrophy line in my county which serves the towns of Roscrea, Cloughjordan, Nenagh and Birdhill remains undervalued and has been for years, and it is true that the potential has not been realised. If one wants to open up rural Ireland in a way that means we do not have to rely on our cars then the Minister has to act. One should listen to the North Tipperary Community Rail Partnership for whom this is a very important issue and who have done extensive research into this issue. On local radio recently one of its members pointed out that in 1962 the journey time was one and a half hours. In May 1987, it was an hour and 17 minutes. It now takes two hours. It is crazy to think that it takes longer now, after some 50 years, which is even after work has been carried out on the track. That is unacceptable in this day and age on such a major issue. The partnership is now calling for the following: line speeds to be increased on the sections of the track that have been developed into continuous welded rail; a review to take place on the lifting of existing overall speed restrictions from 50 mph to 60 mph; a service to be provided in the middle of the day to be added in both directions; and the timetable to be reviewed, as stated by Deputy Stanley. We need a proactive approach to be taken by the Minister and also by the rail management. With this in mind I make another call on the Minister to appoint a regional rail manager who would develop the line's potential.The Ballybrophy line has a level of regional importance that nobody in a position of authority wants to see. The people of Tipperary need to see the Minister share this vision and to recognise what this line has to offer in tourism, third level education, in giving access to industry and as a means to get to work. The group has met with Iarnród Éireann on this matter. Can the Minister now tell me what he will do to show that his green agenda extends to the rail transport in my part of rural Ireland?

This Government is committed to investment in the public transport network, to increase the size of the rail fleet in order to address the capacity constraints and to expand services in many parts of the country. Initiatives such as the Cork line relaying programme will improve journey times for passengers and will increase rail as a sustainable transport option. Further ambitious fleet investment programmes will see the overall Iarnród Éireann fleet grow over the coming years with 41 additional intercity rail carriages currently contracted and a further contract for up to 600 over the coming decade set to be awarded next year. These initiatives will help expand capacity in areas where it is badly needed and in areas where future population growth and development are expected. Unfortunately, the Ballybrophy route has to date been struggling to accommodate large passenger numbers. Iarnród Éireann identifies this service as a continually low-density passenger numbers route although the company has over the years operated varying levels of service during periods of both economic growth and recession. I understand that Iarnród Éireann has undertaken both national and local promotions on the route but that such efforts have not resulted in any significant uptake and passenger numbers have remained low. In this context, the National Transport Authority has no plans at present to increase services on this route. larnród Éireann promotes usage of rail services, both in national promotion and through local initiatives. I am told it has a number of partnerships which support this, including on the Ballybrophy to Limerick line.The company has stated it will continue to promote all routes and engage with local communities to seek new business opportunities and examine the potential for revisions and enhancements to timetables that will benefit specific customer groups. Furthermore, larnród Éireann has advised that the infrastructure on this stretch of line does not facilitate higher-speed rail services. The current speed profile on this section of the rail network is consistent with the age and condition of the track infrastructure and the greater number of user-operated level crossings, which would pose safety risks with increased speed. The moneys that would be required to improve the line significantly to address these matters are not available within the present national development plan, NDP, envelope, which envisages investment of up to €8.6 billion over the period 2018 to 2027 to further develop sustainable mobility options. Given the pressures and opportunities that have already been identified and that will need to be addressed in the NDP, it is unlikely that the upgrade of this line would be afforded greater investment priority than other proposals for capacity elsewhere on the rail network and other public transport and active travel projects. I advise the Deputies that the draft Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy includes some proposals in regard to encouraging greater use of the line as a commuter route into Limerick. I assure the Deputies that these and other proposals are under consideration now that the consultation process has ended. I look forward to working with them to promote such possibilities as ways of improving the rail services in this area, as we are going to do around the rest of the country.

It is very disappointing. Of course there is not a struggle to accommodate large numbers but the point is that the existing infrastructure is not being utilised. We have not got bang for our buck for the commuters or in terms of economic development along the route. There are a number of low-cost steps that can be taken. The reason Deputy Browne, as a Tipperary Deputy, and I, as a Laois-Offaly Deputy, are raising this is that we have met people along the line who use the service, from Cloughjordan, Nenagh and Ballybrophy itself. A report needs to be produced on the line because there has been significant investment in it. I refer to a low-cost measure that can be implemented. One could have faster trains on the lines because there is continuous welded track. A new timetable needs to be produced. The timetable can be tweaked. A train should not sit idle all day. Continuity of service needs to be addressed because the reliability of the track is being undermined by the frequent line closures without sufficient notice. That does not cost money to address. The timetable needs to be publicised. Social media can be used. Iarnród Éireann can publicise via Twitter, Facebook and other media.

It is worth bearing in mind for the future. I have given an example of how the location of the line works for the region. If services on the Ballybrophy line were aligned with those at Limerick Junction, it would yield an opportunity to link with the Dublin-Cork line. It makes sense; it is as simple as that. It opens up the region. That is what Deputy Stanley and I want, and that is what the people in the region deserve. When I speak of Limerick Junction, it should be noted that the Waterford service has particular problems that also need to be addressed. Tipperary town is on the N24, the main route to Waterford, but it is clogged with traffic. One reason for this is the timetable for the Tipperary-Waterford service. It just does not suit people. The south of the county is poorly served by rail and the north of the county is also. If the Minister wants rural Ireland to progress and work, he will have to commit to engaging personally with us and Iarnród Éireann on a vision for moving forward. Sixty years on, it should not take an extra 30 minutes to make the journey. It is absolutely crazy given all the money spent on the line.

Deputy Browne is absolutely right that the current arrangements are not satisfactory. The timetables, journey times, lack of frequency, poor quality of the line and the fact that the carriages are left in Colbert Station in Limerick for the rest of the day are not satisfactory. Everyone recognises that. Deputy Browne is absolutely right that the services are very much analogous to the current services on the Waterford-Limerick line. In effect, we are maintaining the line but we are not really utilising it to the full extent. We are at a point of change. The Government is committed very much to towns-first policy. One of the characteristics of the two rail lines I have mentioned is that they go through a series of towns that would benefit greatly from development, particularly close to their centres, where railway stations tend to be. Therefore, I do not disagree at all with the Deputy's intention. The question is how to get the numbers up to justify the investment we need to make to rectify the problem. It has partly to do with the poor service but even if there were an increase in that regard, we would have to remember that the number of passengers in the past four years on the Ballybrophy line, for example, has ranged from about 100 to 150 per day. This is very low. I mentioned the question of whether it may be possible to start increasing patronage of the line for commuter rail services to Limerick. The Limerick metropolitan area transport strategy cited Castleconnell station, for example. One could go even further out and consider commuter numbers from Nenagh to Limerick and determine whether improving the service and providing new really high-quality electric battery trains would increase the volume of passengers. Would a metropolitan-type commuter service, in turn, start to turn around the prospects for the whole Ballybrophy line because it would start to see usage and patronage that might make it more viable?

I thank the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in advance not only for responding here but also for his responses to my parliamentary questions and letters on this issue. I hope he, along with the Minister for Justice, can tell how passionate I am about my proposal. I believe it involves a common sense approach to dealing with the plague of crimes affecting society and that will always affect it. In recent months, I have been vocal about an issue that is very close to home in my constituency, involving families I know very well. I refer to the rise in knife crime. In 2019, over 2,000 knives were seized from our streets. This year alone, over 1,200 knives have already been seized. Hospital admissions in this regard are up by 10% owing to stabbings and slashings. We must ask how we can target the source of crime. This year has been a bonanza year, particularly for An Garda Síochána, primarily due to the Covid pandemic restrictions. So far, bearing in mind that the year is not even over and we are not even at the end of November, €16 million in cash has been seized by An Garda alone, never mind the Criminal Assets Bureau or any other agency. Last year, it was just over €7 million. The year before that, it was just over €7 million. This year alone, An Garda has taken in more cash than in the previous two years together. What will we do with it? I anticipate the Minister's reply. I appreciate what it is and will not necessarily dispute it but we can take the money and plough it straight in at source to tackle the causes of crimes. We can run youth diversion programmes, new education programmes and work experience programmes and pay for addiction counsellors and social workers. People always talk about sentencing and being tough on law and order but if one is not tough on the causes of crime, one is merely allowing it to continue apace. I am aware of the budgeting argument. The Minister says we are not in a position to work it out but the money in question is new money. Rather than just ploughing it back into the Exchequer to have it scattered around Departments, we should ring-fence it. We have an additional €9 million this year alone. This does not compare with any of the previous two years. I refer to the additional €9 million in cash that has been seized, not to mention the moneys from the goods auctioned off by the Criminal Assets Bureau, such as the luxury watches, motor cars, property and designer art. Every day on An Garda Síochána's Twitter account, one sees that €10,000 has been seized here and that €1 million has been seized there, or that ten motorbikes have been seized here and that 17 Rolex watches have been seized there. Rather than saying it is great and taking the money, let us invest in the communities that are absolutely devastated by the criminals and gangsters. Let us take the ill-gotten gains of some of the worst criminals and mobsters in the country and invest them in the communities and projects that will make sure the residents' sons and daughters will not go down the path of crime that so many in their communities have gone down. I ask the Minister once again, this time on the floor of the Chamber, to reconsider this matter, if only in respect of the additional €9 million seized this year, and ring-fence the money next year for a new project.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	512	I thank Deputy Richmond for raising this Topical Issue tonight and for the sustained interest he has shown on this issue on which I know he has submitted several parliamentary questions in the past. The response I have focuses on the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, in particular. I know Deputy Richmond is, as he has acknowledged, familiar with the responses he has been receiving to date on the ring-fencing of proceeds of this nature. I will put some of the key points on the record for the benefit of the House. I will then perhaps engage further with Deputy Richmond on how to we can try to move this issue forward. I acknowledge that Deputy Richmond's question is broader than the question of the CAB. As Deputy Richmond has outlined, it encompasses the cash collected by An Garda Síochána separate to the operations undertaken by CAB. CAB is a multiagency statutory body established under the Act of 1996. It is charged with targeting a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive or are suspected to derive directly or indirectly from criminal conduct. The bureau works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels. It continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime. I note today the bureau had an operation in County Louth that was reported on as well. It is good to see that the bureau continues to be active. The actions of the bureau send a strong message to criminals and local communities to the effect that crime does not pay and that the State will not allow criminals to profit from their crimes. In accordance with the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2016, all funds collected by the bureau are forwarded to the Central Exchequer Fund. The investigations conducted by CAB and the consequential proceedings and actions have resulted in more than €194 million being returned to the Exchequer as a whole for the years 1996 to 2019. This is an average of a little over €8 million per year. In 2019 almost €4 million was forwarded to the Central Fund, compared to €5.6 million in 2018. In accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Constitution, there must be statutory authority for any State revenues not to be paid into the Central Fund. Examples of such exceptions include appropriations-in-aid, which are departmental receipts retained in accordance with the Public Accounts and Charges Act 1981, and PRSI contributions, which are paid into the Social Insurance Fund in accordance with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. The Government draws expenditure from this Central Fund for all public services and investment, including early intervention programmes to tackle crime and the illegal drugs trade. The Constitution requires, and Government accounting principles provide, that public moneys may be spent only as voted or approved by Dáil Éireann, unless otherwise provided by statute. While there have been calls from time to time for moneys confiscated by the bureau to be ring-fenced, a policy of ring-fencing moneys obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of same for a specific purpose runs contrary to the normal Estimates process. It is a general principle of public financial management that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would tend to constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy. I will allow the rest of the reply to be noted and I will respond on the second occasion to the Deputy.
#NealeRichmond	unknown-#NealeRichmond-party	unknown-#NealeRichmond-dob	unknown-#NealeRichmond-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	513	I appreciate the response of the Minister of State, including the written response and all the detail and acknowledge that the Minister's response focused on the Criminal Assets Bureau and its work. I have talked the point to death at this stage in respect of using cash seized by An Garda Síochána and the extra cash seized this year. I will leave that with the Minister for tonight but I will be coming back to him on this matter. I want to talk in particular about CAB and some of the obstacles raised and pointed out so eloquently, not only in the Minister's response this evening but also in parliamentary questions. Unfortunately, we need to start thinking differently. It is not that hard. This policy is one that many of our neighbours have introduced. We can and must learn from the examples. France's agency for recovery and management of seized and confiscated assets was set up in 2010. It was set up directly modelled on the Criminal Assets Bureau. Those responsible saw Ireland and the great work that CAB had been doing since the mid-1990s. They said they needed that for France. More important, that agency sets aside a percentage of revenue from seized assets every year to fund policy operations and drug diversion programmes. In New Zealand, the asset recovery unit seized the proceeds of crime. The organisation is similar to our CAB. Proceeds contained in the criminal proceeds fund policy, health and customs. Agencies can apply to make use of these funds for initiatives such as alcohol and drug treatment services, initiatives to buy organised crime and to address mental health issues and to generally improve community well-being. I have already mentioned the youth diversion programmes and education programmes. This is something Ireland should be looking into emulating. I work on a daily basis with Councillor Kenneth Egan of my party. He is a county councillor on the ground in Clondlakin and Neilstown. Councillor Egan is also an addiction councillor and a youth boxing coach. He is one of the people who is in touch with exactly what is going on. Let us imagine we could turn around to him and state that CAB would guarantee a fund. I will go back to my original points. What about the bonus cash amounting to €9 million? That does not compare to the previous two years. We could ring fence it directly. That would send a brilliant message to the most deprived communities and the people in our society who too often we leave behind.

I will write to the Minister for Justice and engage with her in respect of this issue. It has always been the case that the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform resist any efforts to ring-fence proceeds for any particular purpose. They like that to be part of the Estimates process. That has already been the case but that does not mean it necessarily has to pertain indefinitely I future. The idea from the Deputy is a good one in principle. It is a question of how it can be made to work in practice. That is what we need to examine in further detail. I will commit to doing that. I wish to point out that the justice sector and justice Vote has done well in the context of the Estimates and 2021 with extra funding of almost €200 million going to a range of initiatives. The extra funding is for not only extra gardaí but the Garda youth diversion programmes as well. Extra funding will be available for a significant number of organisations that provide supports in the area correctly identified by Deputy Richmond as one where there is a need. I acknowledge the work of the Deputy on this issue. I will engage with the Minister for Justice. Perhaps we can take the issue up off-line again.

Tá an cheist seo ardaithe agam léi, agus le Airí Oideachais eile, roimhe seo. D'ardaigh mé í le déanaí leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Madigan. My specific part of this relates to Scoil Colm. I know the Minister has visited the site, as has the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and other Members of this House and the other House. They saw for themselves the empty school building in an educational campus in the heart of Dublin 12 near HSE facilities. I believe the HSE is about to put a disability service next door to this site. It is ideal in every single way and it also would help to address a major need that has been identified by the Department and parents. They are crying out for somewhere central when they are dropping off one child and another child then has to be put back into the car and moved to another location. That is if they are lucky enough to find a place for their child who has additional needs. There is an urgent need for this. Few sites are available in Dublin. This is an educational space; it is an old school. However, it also has gardens, playing fields, yards and so on already in situ. It might cost money to fit it out because we are talking about an autism spectrum disorder-specific school rather than a unit. I know there have been discussions with the Department. Can the Minister fill us in on whether they have gone well? The Department has been liaising with the various school patrons and the like.

She will be aware of the burden falling on principals at the moment and of the additional pressures Covid has put on them right across the board, in primary schools, post-primary schools, special schools and so on. Consider those principals who are managing everything connected to Covid, managing the ordinary running of the school, managing the running of ASD units and also teaching a class or perhaps teaching more than one class. There are 83 teaching principals in mainstream schools where there are special classes. Of these schools, 21 have two or more special classes. Those principals did not have to take on all the additional work in relation to that but they took the decision that their community needed these units and that they wanted to serve those needs. They deserve commendation for that but the fact is that these principals, in particular, are under inordinate pressure and that has implications for their schools. I spoke to one teaching principal in a mainstream school just outside of Mallow in County Cork. They have two special classes and they communicated to me how demanding the role of a teaching principal is generally, while also managing these classes. On paper, and for the Department, this looks like a four-teacher school, but the reality is this principal manages a team of 18 staff members, including four teachers, two special education teachers, two ASD class teachers and six special needs assistants, SNAs, as well as whatever they have to do in terms of bus escorts. There is a fair bit of work in that, on top of managing the curriculum and the school and ensuring it all works. This has all become even more difficult. The children who missed out most during lockdown were those with special needs. The burden on these schools is enormous and we need to do something about this. We need to relieve the pressure on these teachers.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	517	I thank both Deputies for raising these issues as it gives me an opportunity to outline the current position regarding provision for children with special educational needs and the supports in place for schools with special classes. Enabling children with special educational needs, including autism, to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for Government. Next year, more than 20% of the total educational budget, or €2 billion, will be invested in supporting children with special needs. As a result of the numbers of special education teachers, SNAs and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. Special class provision in mainstream primary and post-primary schools is a central element of the continuum of education provision in place to support children with special educational needs. This continuum extends from full-time placement in mainstream classes and special classes through to full-time enrolment in special schools with a number of options in between. The Department supports this continuum through a range of dedicated supports in line with the needs of the child. These supports include the provision of teachers, SNAs and psychological support from the National Educational Psychological Service. In addition, there are specialist supports provided by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, including extensive professional development programmes for principals and teachers and advice for schools, parents and families. The overall aim of the continuum is to ensure that every child is supported in the journey of realising his or her potential through education in an inclusive and caring school environment.  I am keenly aware of the huge contribution made by all principals, including teaching principals, in supporting this continuum. I acknowledge the work of school leaders who opened special classes in response to the needs of their community. I am aware too that Covid-19, as Deputy Ó Laoghaire outlined, has placed an additional strain on principals and our schools. Apart from the supports I outlined earlier, there are a number of other supports provided by the Department. As part of the additional funding to schools, €10.2 million has been allocated specifically to support principals and deputy principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools. This funding will provide each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week, and release days for deputy principals in those schools that have an existing administrative principal for this school year. More than 1,700 primary schools with teaching principals have benefitted from the increase in release days. Teaching principals in schools with special classes are allocated a further four release days, in addition to the 37 allocated to each school with a teaching principal. There are also arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school. Notwithstanding the extent of this investment and the supports which have been put in place, I am also conscious that there are some parts of the country, including Dublin 12, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified needs. The process is ongoing. It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and, where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. As Minister, I have powers under section 37A of the Education Act to direct a school to provide additional places but this power is only used as a last resort where all reasonable efforts have failed. Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under section 37. The legislative process is again under way this year in respect of south Dublin. While progress is being made, the NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream.  In terms of the provision of additional special school places in the area, I can confirm that sites such as Scoil Colm are currently being examined. The work will continue until every child has access to a suitable education. In the meantime, special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are available to support both families and schools who need help or advice.

It is a pity that there does not seem to be any progress, otherwise, the Minister would have taken the opportunity to announce or fill us in on some progress. All she said in relation to Scoil Colm was that it was being examined but I was told that in March, May and October. I do not expect a miracle overnight but has the examination gone beyond walking around the building? Has it looked at all the numbers in relation to children who will need such a school? I note the Minister said the NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating it but she is the Minister and the one who has to dictate policy. There is a crying need for such a school in the Dublin 12 area so, hopefully, the next time I ask, she will have a better response.

Perhaps in her response she might give an indication of that. I raise this issue in a spirit of trying to see if we can find a solution to it. It is not a huge cohort of schools but where an issue arises in a unit or in terms of the significant number of staff who are dependent on the principal, it is usually the mainstream class, which the principal teaches, that loses out on account of this. Indeed, the whole school loses out. Extraordinary work is being done but principals cannot continue to perform the miracle of loaves and fishes with the limited number of hours and all the different responsibilities they have. The group of teaching principals I have been engaging with put forward proposals. The sums of money we are talking about are very small. Some €3 million or € 4 million would resolve this and make them administrative principals. Will the Minister commit to ensuring that or, at the very least, exploring whether principals teaching in small schools can be made administrative principals? It is a reasonable ask. Will she meet with the group of principals in question?

I am conscious of the points Deputy Ó Laoghaire raised. We have gone a step forward in the recent budget, in particular in relation to the measures we put in place as a consequence of Covid-19. I appreciate there is work still remaining but I am very conscious of it, and I say that unequivocally to the Deputy. The Department will continue to support principals in schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.Some €2 billion, or 20%, of next year's total education budget, will be spent on making additional provision for children with special educational needs. This is to be welcomed and is richly deserved. It means that the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants, special classes and special school places has increased significantly. This will enable children with special educational needs to continue being a priority for the Government. The Deputy will be aware that I am familiar with the Scoil Choilm case. I have engaged with representatives on it and will expedite it as quickly as I can.

Since her appointment to the Cabinet, I have engaged with the Minister on the school capacity problem in east Cork. Without doubt, it is one of the worst capacity problems in the country. Approximately 100 children in my constituency are without a school place for the second year in a row. The issue rose to prominence around this time last year when I was first elected to Cork County Council. When engaging with parents, teachers and students, I found the upset and anger on the ground all around my constituency extraordinary. This was particularly the case among parents living in the Midleton and Carrigtwohill areas as well as the small towns and villages in rural communities surrounding that part of my constituency. The Minister is familiar with that part of the world from her time as a teacher. This problem is concerning. Both of us inherited a mess in the sense that, under previous Governments, little action was taken by what is now the Department of Education to foresee the current situation. From my discussions with highly experienced educators in my constituency, areas in Cork East have been badly affected by the failure to consider data from the Central Statistics Office and instead used housing data, which were not reflective of the population statistics in Cork. Cork has one of the youngest populations in the country. Cork East, which I am proud to represent, has a 10% growth rate. The national rate is 3% to 4%, although that changes each year. This has caused a major problem, one that is stressful for the children, their teachers and their schools. We must recognise that the schools have been put in a difficult position. There is no doubting that. They have dealt with the situation in the most diligent way possible. In discussing this matter in the Dáil, it is imperative to acknowledge the work being done by principals, teachers, boards of management and parents' associations across east Cork. There is serious pressure on them to try to accommodate the children. I must be fair. I have worked with the Minister and she has been diligent in her responses to me so far, but frustration is now boiling over in east Cork. Parents want answers as to where their children will get school places. They expect me as their local Deputy to provide them with answers, which is only fair, and I am here with the Minister so late at night to try to get those answers. It would be beneficial were the Department to examine east Cork and acknowledge the situation on the ground. An increasing number of housing developments will be built throughout east Cork. A new town is even being planned at Water-rock. The Department needs to see this situation for the emergency it is and treat it with the urgency it deserves. Will the Minister visit east Cork to meet the principals, parents' associations representatives and boards of management so that she can have a better understanding of the situation on the ground?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	522	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding school developments in east Cork. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, GIS. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including child benefit data from the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives, the first of which is enhanced engagement with local authorities in respect of the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process. The second initiative entails additional engagement on school place requirements with patron bodies regarding their local knowledge. Education and training boards, ETBs, diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras Pátrúnachta and so on can also be important sources of local knowledge. This will add to information provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools. The third initiative involves utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of the October returns process. Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, its delivery is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; or the provision of a new school or schools. Similar to the process adopted for September 2020 readiness, the Department will engage further with patron bodies in the coming weeks in advance of identifying specific September 2021 capacity pressure point priorities that will necessitate specific action. In a "normal" year, addressing the increased demands for school places, while challenging, is manageable, generally through utilisation of existing spare capacity within schools, rental, temporary accommodation or other short-term measures pending the delivery of permanent accommodation. Building projects are in train or proposed for a number of post-primary schools in Cork East, which is the area of specific interest to the Deputy. Carrigtwohill Community College is a co-educational post-primary school established in 2016. It is currently located in temporary accommodation pending the construction of a permanent school building. The new school building will have capacity for 1,000 pupils. It is at stage 2b of the architectural planning process and planning permission has been granted. Pending the construction of the permanent building, the Department has approved additional temporary accommodation to cater for the school's immediate needs. This project is part of a new three-school campus development in Carrigtwohill. The other two schools to be located on the campus are Scoil Chlíodhna and Scoil Mhuire Naofa. St. Aloysius's College, Carrigtwohill, is an all-girls post-primary school with an enrolment of 776 for the 2019-20 school year. The Department has approved a grant to the school to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils. The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery. St. Colman's Community College, Midleton, is a co-educational post-primary school with an enrolment of 775 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. A building project for the school that will provide capacity for 1,000 pupils is currently on site and is due to be completed in the coming weeks. Pobalscoil na Tríonóide, Youghal, is a co-educational post-primary school with an enrolment of 977 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. The Department has approved a grant to the school to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,200 pupils. The project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery. Carrignafoy Community College, Cobh, is a co-educational post-primary school with an enrolment of 321 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. A building project to expand the school's capacity to cater for 600 pupils is at the early stage of the architectural planning process. The project is being delivered by the patron, Cork ETB. Coláiste Muire, Cobh, is a co-educational school with an enrolment of 666 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. An application for additional accommodation has been received from the school and is under assessment in the Department. A decision on the application will be conveyed to the school authority when the assessment process has been completed. St. Mary's High School, Midleton, is an all-girls post-primary school with an enrolment of 718 pupils for the 2019-20 school year. An application for additional accommodation has been received by the Department and is under assessment. A decision on the application will be conveyed to the school authority when the assessment process has been completed.

I have engaged with the parents' association there a great deal. As the Minister knows, this has been an arduous and long process, one that has been plagued by numerous issues for many years. Is there an update further to what the Minister outlined to me previously? Will she be in a position to travel to the Cork East constituency in the near future to discuss this matter with representatives of the school, the principal, the board of management and the parents' association?That move would be greatly appreciated. It is needed. From my perspective as a local Deputy, I would be absolutely indebted to the Minister if she was able to fulfil such a commitment. In terms of the Educate Together patronage, I am glad to hear the Minister referenced it because there is a lot of work going on in the Educate Together group in Midleton on the possibility of establishing an additional secondary school for which there is demand. Demand is why we are in this situation. Quite frankly, there are too few school places available in east Cork. As a Government we have to bite the bullet, acknowledge the problem and put coherent steps in place to try to deal with it over the next number of years.  Parents, students and teachers accept that this will not be fixed overnight but we have to be able to say to them that we have a plan. I am glad that the Minister has outlined multiple different school projects throughout east Cork, including Midleton, Youghal and Carrigtwohill, but we need to show a degree of ambition in addition to what the Minister outlined and accept that we need an additional school. We also need to ensure that the staff, teachers and current and future pupils in Carrigtwohill Community College and the primary schools that will come along with that development make sure that the Department of Education brings the project to fruition after the wait they have had. It has been a horrendously difficult experience for many people in the community. As a Deputy representing the area, I will be very grateful if that could be given urgent attention by the Department.

In respect of the primary schools in the area the building project for Scoil Chlíodhna, Carrigtwohill, a co-educational community national school, which will provide permanent accommodation for the school is currently at stage 2B of the architectural planning process. The building project, when completed, will provide capacity for 24 classrooms. Scoil Mhuire Naofa, Carrigtwohill, is a co-educational primary school. A building project for the school is currently at stage 2B of the architectural planning process. The building project, when completed, will provide capacity for 24 classrooms. Scoil Chlochair Mhuire, Carrigtwohill, is a co-educational primary school. An extension of the school to provide capacity for a 16 classroom school is proposed. The project is currently at the preparation of the accommodation brief stage.  Scoil An Athar Tadhg, Carrignavar, is a co-educational primary school. A major building project to provide a new 16 classroom school is currently at stage 2B of the architectural planning process.  It is also, of course, open to the patrons of schools to submit an application for additional interim accommodation to the Department for consideration. should it be required. I want to thank the Deputy for raising the issue of accommodation in east Cork. The Department is concerned to ensure that sufficient capacity is in place to meet the needs of schools throughout this area, through the delivery of the building projects that are planned or those that are in train, as well as through the Department's engagement with patron bodies in identifying specific capacity pressure priorities for September 2021, which will necessitate specific action. In regard to the Carrigtwohill issue raised by the Deputy, he is aware that it is part of the bundle for the first quarter of 2021 and will be expedited as quickly as possible. I will of course continue to work with the Deputy on an ongoing basis. I know all of these projects are of particular interest to him and I commend him on his diligence and ongoing interest in delivering these projects for the east Cork area.
