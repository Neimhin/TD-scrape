I refer to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. The 2015 Mental Health Commission inspection report referred to various areas of compliance and excellent standards, with many good practices on display. It appears that the hospital and, in particular, its staff are working to a high level and providing an excellent service within the confines of the resources given to them. The hospital was described in the report as:The approved centre was an inpatient service of the National Forensic Service. It was located in Dundrum Dublin and had 94 beds ... The main building was over 150 years old and was not suitable for the care and treatment of mental health patients. Plans for the new forensic hospital were progressing.The plans will be now be realised on the site at Portrane. Will the Minister of State confirm that the opening date will be 2020? I would like to discuss the facilities in place for violent, mentally ill people while we await the new hospital. The Irish Times reported on 21 June that Professor Harry Kennedy, the clinical director, had told the High Court that all 94 beds in the Central Mental Hospital were full and that there was a waiting list of 24. He said that while mental hospitals in Ireland had been closed down, the necessary services were not being provided to look after people who had been detained in them. This sentiment was echoed by my old colleague and the former general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, Mr. Des Kavanagh, in his report earlier this year.He stated, "the correlation between the closure of hospitals and the increase in the prison population of people with serious mental illness is inescapable." He continued by discussing regular cases of violence and, indeed, homicide involving those who are mentally ill. He urged the Government to review all such killings and assaults over the past ten years and come up with recommendations for a prevention strategy. The Mental Health Commission's inspection report in 2015 found that:There were eight units in the approved centre [at the Central Mental Hospital] and this allowed the male patients to progress from acute care with high security through medium to low security and rehabilitation. However, all ten female patients were accommodated in one unit, whatever their level of acuity, security requirements and rehabilitation needs.Does the Minister for Health think that the opening of the extra beds in the period prior to the new hospital being opened would improve these conditions? The report also states:Due to the waiting list of seven patients in other approved centres [never mind prisons] awaiting transfer ... plans were progressing to renovate and re-open a closed unit (Unit 5) to provide 10 beds for these patients. The completion date for this was the end of 2015.The beds in question are ready, duvets have been placed on them and yet they lie empty. Mental health institutions have been closed down and nothing substantial has replaced them. As a result, the rare but real cases of people with mental illness who have violent inclinations have slipped through the gaps and caused real harm in our society and to themselves. I have a few questions for the Minister. Has the Central Mental Hospital reopened the ten beds? If not, why? How does he intend to rectify the current crisis in the period prior to the facility in Portrane being opened? I have spoken to various staff and learned that negotiations have been held up due the fact that decisions handed down by the Workplace Relations Commission in 2012 have not been implemented. I ask that the Minister intervene in order to get the negotiations going. I urge him to bring people to the table and to get these beds open.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	I thank Senator Devine for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Health who, unfortunately, cannot be with us. The Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum has a current bed complement of 93. All of these beds are operational. It is a priority under the HSE's service plan for 2017 to increase bed capacity at the hospital. An additional ten beds to accommodate patients awaiting admission under section 21(2) of the Mental Health Act 2001 are due to be commissioned shortly, which will increase capacity to 103 beds. The additional beds remain unopened pending agreement between the executive and the relevant unions on issues that have been through a process at the Workplace Relations Commission. I understand that these are likely to be referred to the Labour Relations Commission for adjudication. At this point, it is not possible to give a precise date for the additional beds to open. The executive is continuing efforts to open them in the autumn. I urge all involved with this process to work together to open these beds as quickly as possible. It has been accepted generally for some time that there are serious bed capacity pressures at the Central Mental Hospital. It is on this basis that the HSE prioritised the opening of more beds. The management of those requiring admission is being prioritised on the basis of assessed clinical need. The provision of new facilities, or other non-capital initiatives, to enhance forensic mental health provision nationally is core to modernising mental health services in line with A Vision for Change. To date, significant ring-fenced funding has been provided to improve all aspects of mental health care, including prioritising the replacement of the Central Mental Hospital. This has resulted in a total funding of just over €850,000 to the HSE for mental health for this year. Following the signing of a contract on 1 June, construction of a new 170-bed national forensic mental health complex at Portrane recently began. This facility will replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. It will also include dedicated components for mental health and intellectual disability, a forensic child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, and a new 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit. The new national facility will provide psychiatric care in a modern and high-quality setting that rivals the best available elsewhere. A core approach is developing the concept of recovery, wherever possible, in delivering mental health services - whether in community or residential settings - into the future. The operation of the additional beds at the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum will assist towards this objective. It will relieve the acknowledged pressures on the existing forensic mental health and judicial systems. It also paves the way to opening the new facilities in early 2020. The Senator may rest assured that I will keep this matter under close review with the HSE or that I will refer the issues to the Minister, Deputy Harris, in order that all of the parties involved in the current process reach agreement as quickly as possible in the interests of those that require this key service.

Unfortunately, no date has been given in terms of the negotiations at the Workplace Relations Commission. The stalemate has lasted a year and a half at this stage. Does the Minister of State understand that there are people who cannot be managed in approved centres and people in prison who are waiting to avail of the new facility? A tragedy occurred in my area, which is located in the constituency of Dublin South-Central, last week. The person involved cannot be admitted to the Central Mental Hospital due to overcrowding. To free up space, the institution would have to pick somebody to return to the prison population but he or she would clearly be unfit to be moved. We are not fulfilling our duty of care and nurses in particular are concerned about this matter. The HSE has agreed that the staff have made prudent demands. Rosters were also implemented without a by your leave. The days of draconian management are over. Consultations and negotiations are required, which is the nub of the issue, but the Workplace Relations Commission will probably not meet for some months. I urge the Minister of State to ask the Minister to hurry this matter along and get these much-needed beds opened.

I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well. As he is undoubtedly aware, even though this matter is not his particular area, the Defence Forces are faced with many challenges. One regularly hears about low morale, the recruitment and retention of staff and low pay. It is sad that many members of the Defence Forces must avail of family income supplement, FIS, to simply survive. With respect, not assigning a full Ministry to the defence portfolio sends out the wrong message. The current Minister responsible for the Defence Forces is doing a good job but I would much prefer if he could sit at the Cabinet table as it would afford him an opportunity to exert more power and influence on his Cabinet colleagues. I have outlined many issues. Recently, leave entitlements for members of the Defence Forces were brought to my attention. At present, leave entitlements can be lost at the end of the year if a member of the Defence Forces who has been posted overseas for a mission has his or her term extended or if a member is on sick leave or falls pregnant. The loss of leave is unfair and the situation should not be allowed to continue. Interestingly, over the five-year period from 2001 to 2016, as many as 146,038 days were lost by members of the Defence Forces. That is a staggering figure. In monetary terms, the amount involved would be €22 million. I am sure that the Minister of State appreciates that people in any employment can get sick or fall pregnant. It is very sad that in such situations people lose their annual leave allotments if they are out sick at the time they were about to take their annual leave. People, through no fault of their own, can find themselves in these situations. The leave entitlement aspect needs to be addressed. Does the Minister intend to amend the Workplace Relations Act 2015? If so, the terms and conditions enjoyed by all workers could be enjoyed by the members of the Defence Forces, which is the least they deserve. There is a lack of respect for the Defence Forces and the leave entitlement issue is just another example. I am interested in hearing the comments that the Minister of State will make.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	9	I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, who, as a super junior Minister, sits at Cabinet. The Taoiseach has full responsibility for defence matters and sits at the Cabinet table so such matters are well covered. Defence Force Regulations, DFR, A11, governs the granting of leave, other than sick leave, in the Permanent Defence Force.As part of normal personnel management, the granting of annual leave is a balance between the entitlement of the individual to annual leave and the requirement to ensure continuity of a public service. Paragraph 16 of DFR A11 provides for the carrying forward of annual leave, not granted or availed of in the leave year concerned. This can be of benefit both to the individual and the organisation. Officers may be allowed to carry forward a maximum of 24 days, non-commissioned officers and privates in the Army and Air Corps a maximum of 19 days, and non-commissioned officers and ordinary or able seamen of the Naval Service a maximum of 24 days. In addition, members are entitled to Defence Force holidays, which include all public holidays along with the 1916 Commemoration day, 11 July and 15 August. The Minister is also authorised to grant such other days, usually in the form of additional days leave at Easter and Christmas, such as Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday, to the Defence Forces to reflect the leave allowable to other public servants who work on a five-day a week basis. A request to increase the number of carryover days has been considered. The current carryover has been found to be proportionate and reasonable. I have been advised by Department of Defence officials that three plenary summonses have been taken by members of the Defence Forces in relation to the transposition of the working time directive and the carryover of annual leave. Given that these matters are before the courts it would be inappropriate to comment further on the legal proceedings which have been commenced in this matter. The conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, provides a formal mechanism for the PDF representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the official side. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service. It is open to the representative associations to submit claims to the official side in relation to matters falling within the conciliation and arbitration scheme. Generally, claims relate to pay and conditions, award of allowances etc. When submitted, these claims are generally the subject of negotiations and where agreement is not reached it is open to both sides to seek the assistance of an adjudicator to settle the matter. The Minister has received representations from PDFORRA seeking to have access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court made available to it in the event of any future legislative changes being made to provide An Garda Síochána with access to same. The proposals in relation to An Garda Síochána being granted such access will require detailed legislative change and the Department of Justice and Equality has established a working group to examine in detail what future legislative changes are required. While present arrangements have worked well, it is intended to review the conciliation and arbitration scheme and the Minister has agreed that this should happen towards the end of this year. This review will be informed by any future arrangements to be made for An Garda Síochána.

There are many issues with which we must deal. Some of them are complex and some are not of our making but their resolution will be very tricky and may take some time, both for the UK and European sides. There are some, however, which I believe can be resolved quite early and quite simply, one of which is energy security. Ireland is largely reliant on energy imports from the UK and, while I hope this continues, it would be prudent to secure our supply by looking further afield into the European Union. The easiest way to do this is by the completion of the Celtic Interconnector. The EU designation of this project as one of common interest, meaning it has been allocated 50% of funding in the past week, is welcome and we need to grab the bull by the horns and bring the project to fruition as quickly as possible. We need to work with our counterparts in France and the wider EU so that we will have the option of getting an energy supply from France as well as the UK. I ask the Minister to outline what stage the application is at for the foreshore licence to land the line in Ireland, and what dealings have been held by EirGrid and its French counterparts in RTE. How is the Government working with its counterparts in France and the European Commission to bring this project to fruition?
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	12	I thank Senator Richmond for giving me the opportunity to discuss what is a potentially very important electricity infrastructure project, particularly so now in the context of Brexit. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten. Interconnection is viewed as critical infrastructure by the European Commission in order to move to a genuinely integrated electricity market. This is reflected in national policy through the White Paper on energy, published in December 2015. The Celtic Interconnector is a €1 billion electricity interconnector jointly proposed by EirGrid and its French counterparts, the French transmission system operator, Reseau de Transport d’Électricité, RTÉ. It is proposed as a 500 MW to 700 MW high-voltage direct current line that will run from the north-west coast of France to Ireland’s south coast, coming onshore at either Cork, Waterford or Wexford. At this scale it would be able to provide electricity for some 450,000 homes. In July 2016, together with the Taoiseach and the then President of France, François Hollande, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, was present at the signing of a memorandum of understanding between EirGrid and RTE. This marked the completion of the feasibility phase of the project and was an agreement between the two organisations to move to the current phase. The feasibility phase of the project was a two-year process, part funded by the EU’s connecting Europe facility, CEF, programme. It concluded in mid-2016. A suite of marine surveys and marine engineering studies was carried out, as well as the identification of possible landing sites and preliminary economic and other assessments. This phase provided the information required to determine that there was sufficient justification for EirGrid and RTE to proceed to the current phase of the project. This current phase of the project comprises an indepth economic assessment of the project, technical and environmental studies and pre-consultation in preparation for permit granting procedures in France and Ireland. Last month the project was awarded further funding of €4 million from the CEF to support the delivery of this phase of the project. Around the middle of next year EirGrid and RTE are expected to seek regulatory approval for the development of the project, with a final investment decision to be taken in 2020. The construction of the project would be expected to be completed circa 2025. The Celtic Interconnector project has the potential to provide a reliable high-capacity electricity link between Ireland and France that would have significant benefits for the people of Ireland. The project would provide access to the European electricity market, leading to expected increased competition and lower prices in Ireland. It would also improve security of electricity supply and facilitate increased capacity for renewable energy here via access to the mainland European market. As the Senator said, in the context of Brexit it is hugely important that we have an additional interconnector to the one we have with the UK. I hope we will see progress on it and that it can be provided for by 2025.

The issue has been raised by my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, in the Dáil by way of parliamentary question in the past 13 months but no progress has been made. Deputy Robert Troy has been told consistently that the legislation is imminent, yet the Minister does not seem to know whether primary legislation or a statutory instrument is required to transpose the EU regulation. Today we learned from a senior figure in the airline industry that the delay apparently was in the Office of the Attorney General, which has yet to sign off on a statutory instrument. This seems to be the second time the Office of the Attorney General has been used as an excuse for the Government's failure to implement legislation. We know that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill has been held up conveniently in the Office of the Attorney General. It is also strange, given that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has its own legal section. Why has the issue not been dealt with by that section. It is a disgrace that in the wake of Brexit and for the purpose of achieving economic growth the second runway has not been constructed. It is vital for the development of the city and its surrounds. The Minister has failed us again and should be called to the House to explain exactly how he proposes to allow the legislation to be brought before the House to enable the construction of the second runway to proceed. The second issue I wish to raise concerns the report of the Committee of Public Accounts which was published yesterday. I call on the Minister for Justice and Equality to attend the House to explain how he will act on the recommendations made in the report. Serious concerns about the Department of Justice and Equality's oversight of An Garda Síochána were raised. The Department has presided over serious financial and governance irregularities in the force in recent years. The report is also sceptical about the Department's lack of awareness of the irregularities in Templemore. The Minister needs to commence an internal review, not just of An Garda Síochána but also of his Department, especially of the reporting structures between it and An Garda Síochána. It is not enough to just note the contents of the report. The Committee of Public Accounts has raised serious questions in its report and action is needed now by the Minister.

This morning I listened to a BBC radio programme which covered the plight of those arriving in Italy and the circumstances in which they were being kept. The Minister of State at the Department of Defence should come to the House at some point to update us on what is happening at European and inter-armed forces level to devise a real strategy to deal with these issues. If the way into Europe is to have a tide of people crossing in boats that are wholly unsuitable, with many of them losing their lives, and if part of that scene is their rescue on a humanitarian basis and being brought to Italy, there are huge problems not merely for Italy but also for the entire Continent of Europe, with which the Minister of State should deal. We are coming to the end of this term of the Seanad and I am anxious that progress be made in debating the Seanad Reform Bill that was placed before the House. There are many views on it, but they could be accommodated in the debate. I have never heard of a chamber that was afraid of debating a Bill. We should get on with debating the Bill. The former Taoiseach wrote to my group on 8 December 2016 stating the Government, comprising Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance, was committed to the establishment of an implementation group to oversee implementation of the reforms and that A Programme for a Partnership Government contained a commitment to progress them. He then proposed that we establish an implementation group and seek the nomination of persons from both Houses of the Oireachtas to it, but nothing has really happened since. Another eight months have passed since that letter was written, which, itself, came late in the day. I, therefore, propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 47, non-Government motion No. 23, be taken before No. 1 and that the motion be dealt with by the House in short order. It reads: "That Seanad Éireann resolves that provision should be made for Committee Stage of the Seanad Bill 2016 to be debated in Government time during the autumn term 2017".This is not an exorbitant demand. It is merely aimed at ensuring that we should get on with the business in order that everybody would have an opportunity to express his or her views. Whether people are in favour of emigrant votes or whatever, they can express their views and the Bill can be amended accordingly. The legislation will not be in operation in time for the next general election so people in this House who fear the implications as to their immediate survival should rest assured that when this Bill is passed, there will be at least one further general election before it comes into operation.

I want to raise a key recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, namely, equality for those of us on group water schemes. Equity was clearly recommended in the report of the Expert Commission on the Future Funding of Domestic Public Water Services. It is not good enough that many low-income households in rural Ireland are obliged, as matters stand, to continue to pay twice for water. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has said that he will refund the water charges, which will cost €170 million. It would only cost a fraction of that to provide for group water schemes. That is why Sinn Féin, in its last alternative budget, set aside €1.5 million to achieve this. Why has such a key recommendation of both the expert commission and the committee not yet been implemented? There must be equality between those members of group water schemes and those accessing public services. The key difference is that the group water schemes receive an annual subsidy of €70 per household but this subsidy does not cover the full annual cost of accessing the water supply. Those connected to the public water supply and who are customers of Irish Water do not pay an annual charge for accessing this supply. Equity would mean that the State would cover the full annual cost of the group water scheme users accessing that water supply. The submission of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to the committee showed the experience and the extraordinary voluntary effort that goes into every scheme. This is often neglected in the debate relating to the supply of water. Another important matter is the need for a proper and timely programme to be put in place to facilitate the takeover of the schemes that request for this to happen. This is taking far too long and the schemes have been left in the dark as to when the necessary upgrades and takeovers will happen. We urgently need an absolute guarantee from the Minister and his Department that the legislation due in September will deal with the issue of group water schemes and will implement fully the recommendations of the expert group and the committee. I am seeking an assurance that group water schemes will be included under that legislation.

This is just one of a slew of drilling expeditions recently permitted by the Minister, with the North Celtic Sea basin off the coast of Cork and the Kish Bank off Dalkey's Forty Foot swimming spot next in line. The company will drill for 45 to 60 days throughout the summer without a strategic environmental assessment having been carried out. In a desperate plea for investment, it states that it expects to find 5 billion barrels of oil. Has the Minister thought about the impact of these drilling expeditions from a social, environmental and economic point of view? In June 1991, the Government declared all Irish waters to be a whale and dolphin sanctuary, the first of its kind in Europe, but the seismic blasts from exploration and drilling are deadly for these mammals because they give rise to disorientation, deafness and internal bleeding over distances of up to 100 miles. A deaf whale is a dead whale. One blast also kills 64% of zooplankton, which is the basis of the marine ecosystem, for up to 0.7 miles. We cannot afford to look for any more fossil fuels. International climate experts warn that 80% of known fossil fuels must stay in the ground in order that we might avoid going over the safe 2o Celsius limit in respect of global warming. The Minister recently spoke to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IMPACT on the need for a just transition to a low-carbon economy. In banning fracking and working on climate action, the Minister claims that he would protect workers in Bord na Móna, farmers and tourism but he shows that he has no intention of protecting the transition or providing a consistent policy with regard to green investment. In complete doublespeak, he is inviting the destruction of our coastal fishing, marine resources and tourism industries and a marine ecosystem for one of the lowest Government tax takes for oil and gas in the world. Extraction of oil and gas from the Irish Sea is not even profitable. Shell Oil recently left the Corrib gas field with a loss of €2 billion. The granting of these licences is a slap in the face for young Irish people. A peer-reviewed study published yesterday in the journal Earth System Dynamics argues that if massive emissions reductions do not begin soon, the burden placed on young people to extract CO2 emitted by prior generations may become implausibly difficult and costly. This new fossil fuel infrastructure investment will lock Ireland into a completely discredited economic model that serves neither the planet nor its people and that is built on a form of fuel that is fast becoming irrelevant. This shows inconsistency and incompetence on the part of a Minister and a Department named in honour of climate action and environment. I recently made amendments to the fracking legislation to ban offshore fracking and all fossil fuel exploration and these received a great response in the House.

I think Senator Higgins is seconding the amendment but I would be happy to do so if required. It is important that Government time should be allocated to debating the Seanad Bill in the autumn and I am very happy to support that. I also propose that we take No. 21, the Education (Welfare) (Amendment) Bill 2017 today. This is an important Bill on education proposed by Senator Ó Ríordáin. I know the Senator will second my amendment to the Order of Business. I support Senator Ardagh's request that the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to discuss the findings of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts into the financial irregularities at the Garda Training College in Templemore. These were very serious findings, particularly in respect of the Garda Commissioner. Many members of the committee, particularly Deputy Kelly, have called for the Commissioner to resign. I think her position is untenable following the publication of that report. However, the report also discloses serious failings in the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of its oversight of policing practices, particularly those in Templemore. It would be useful if the Minister came before the Seanad to discuss those failings on the part of the Department and how the relatively newly-established Policing Authority might best be equipped to take on a stronger oversight role and, in particular, to have a part to play in the appointment of a new Commissioner.  Today, a long overdue report that was in the possession of the Department of Justice and Equality for two years has been published. This is the report conducted by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on children's experiences in direct provision. It contains some very serious findings, notably that children in direct provision are concerned for their safety, particularly where they see single men seeking asylum being housed alongside families, and really serious problems with the system in terms of food provision. I also welcome the forthcoming publication at noon today of the national mitigation plan by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. I hope the noble aspirations of that plan will be translated into concrete reality and, in particular, that a commitment will be given to include solar energy in renewable energy support schemes along with real commitments in regard to transport. The decarbonisation of transport by 2050 is the bare minimum that should be achieved.

While Members often think of cyber bullying as a significant threat to young people, the study finds that face-to-face bullying remains the most common form of bullying among teenagers. According to the study, cyber bullying is best understood as a new avenue to victimise those already being bullied in traditional ways rather than a way to pick new victims. Whether the method of bullying is through social media or more traditional forms at school and at work, Members should take every opportunity to say it should stop. In that context, I bring to the attention of the House an initiative called I'm a Friend started in the midlands by a man named Charlie Wynne. It is a simple initiative aimed at creating a support community for those being bullied. Its mission is to create a more thoughtful, caring society where friends look out for friends. By wearing the I'm a Friend pin, a person supporting the initiative's ideals make a proud statement that he or she does not agree with bullying behaviour or accept that it is okay to bully others or be bullied by others and that he or she will support the victims of bullying in any way possible. In a similar way to the statement the wearing of a Pioneer pin makes about the wearer, it is hoped that wearing the symbol will spread the message to others. As a person who has been on the receiving end of a barrage of vile personal abuse, I know how it feels to be bullied. During the most recent general election campaign, I was targeted by several people on social media who were too cowardly to talk to me face to face and thought it was okay to personally insult and attack me. I chose to ignore the comments at the time but the bombardment of insults continued. Thankfully, I have the wherewithal to stand up to such bullies. Members should take every opportunity to say that bullying should stop. I'm a Friend is one way to do that. It does not claim to be a solution to all bullying but might be of assistance to some victims. I am informing Members of this organisation in order that they can look it up further. I will endeavour to provide Members with a pin and I hope that every Member will wear it and set an example for others.

It is a great initiative that would bring transparency for those behind the camera as well as those in front of it. It is widely used across Europe with very positive feedback. The London Metropolitan Police Service has deployed approximately 22,000 cameras on its members and has experienced very positive results such as greater transparency in relation to detections and, interestingly, a drop in the number of fictitious complaints against members of the police force. I ask the Leader to mention this to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, in order that a similar initiative be deployed in this country. I compliment students of DCU and Trinity College Dublin on the initiative announced yesterday which involved the team creating several property websites to advertise the rent-a-room scheme. As Members are aware, any householder can rent out a room and receive up to €14,000 tax free, which is very welcome. All Members know of the chronic shortage of accommodation that will arise in the coming months as students from every part of the country come to Dublin to seek a place to stay. I encourage property owners and householders to consider the scheme and its merits and perhaps open their door to students from all parts of the country who are trying to find accommodation in order to further their studies.

Senator Conway-Walsh is correct that there is a two-tier system in regard to water. I chaired the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services. One of its recommendations is that equality will prevail. I hope that action will be taken in that regard and commend Senator Conway-Walsh for raising the issue. There was a very good discussion in the House yesterday with the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy McHugh, regarding a 20-year plan and strategy for the Irish language. He is committed to the strategy. I mentioned that John Wayne once said that when one is on a dead horse, the best thing to do is to get off. The Irish language plan is not working. Over the past six years, there has been a 12% decrease in the number of people actively speaking Irish. Article 8.1 of the Constitution enshrines the Irish language as the first official language of the State. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, to the House for a full debate lasting at least two hours in order that all Members can have an input into this very important area concerning who Irish people are and what we are about. I ask the Leader if the debate could be had when the House reconvenes in September or as soon as possible thereafter.

All Stages should not be taken today. The issue needs further reflection and consideration. It breaks a very important Irish tradition and goes against health and anti-drink strategies and policies. It is offensive to many religious groupings, will not assist tourism and is a bad proposition. It is wrong and is threatening workers' rights. The vast majority of publicans do not want it brought in. I appeal to the Leader to allow more reflection on the matter and for it to run into the autumn, at which stage there can be a wiser consideration of it. Members should not run willy-nilly to dismantle things that are important in this country.

Several Members will have seen correspondence received this week from the family resource centre in Loughrea. There are 108 family resource centres doing amazingly important work across the country. Several Members have probably visited some of them. I was involved in arranging for workers in several family resource centres to join SIPTU. Workers in family resource centres have not received a pay increase since 2008. In view of the years of austerity, that can be understood to some degree. What cannot be understood is the refusal of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to attend the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, on this issue. What signal does it send if State bodies refuse to engage with the industrial relations machinery of the State? A bad example has been set by those at the very top of Government because when the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was Minister for Social Protection, his Department refused to attend the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to SIPTU and community workers. The refusal of Tusla to attend is totally unacceptable and workers in family resource centres deserve not just recognition and nice, kind words, but a pay increase. At the very least, the Government and State bodies should have the respect to attend the Workplace Relations Commission. I ask the Leader, a fellow trade unionist, to support my call for Tusla to attend the WRC and I ask for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, to come to the House as early as possible in the autumn because there should not be a situation where vital workers providing vital services are ignored by the State and, worse than that, the industrial relations machinery of the State is also ignored by the Government. It is not good enough.

We had a debate on this issue on the first day of this Seanad, when it was the first matter brought before the House. Many of us stood on the plinth to propose the Bill on that first day. This is the first Seanad after the public, in its wisdom, decided that it was interested in and engaged with the Seanad. People wanted to be part of its deliberations and of the Seanad process. They recognised its additional value. They also wanted reform. I strongly believe that there was a mandate for reform in the referendum. When I campaigned on the doorsteps for the retention of the Seanad, people told me they wanted reform. The Government gave a commitment in the programme for Government that it would pursue the implementation of the Manning report as a priority. Sadly, it has not been a priority. It is one year later and there has not been any movement in this regard by the Government. The very reasonable proposal put forward by Senator McDowell would give the Government the opportunity to show that it is serious about proceeding with the implementation of the Manning report and that it intends to work with Members across the House to ensure that people see genuine sincerity in politics with regard to Seanad reform. There is scope on Committee Stage for people to put forward the concerns they may have by tabling amendments and debating them properly, as we should do as legislators. I urge the acceptance of the proposed amendment. We should bear in mind that there have been two referendums on this issue, the one I mentioned earlier and the one on the 1979 amendment which has still not been implemented. We have been waiting a long time for this. We must be in good faith with the people of Ireland and ensure we respect their concerns on this issue. We want them to be part of our process as a Seanad.

Outside, it is a soft morning in Dublin but, statistically, we have had 33% less rainfall in the first six months of this year. People might think that this is good for tourism and so forth, but unfortunately the major knock-on effect is that communities in my part of the country and elsewhere are facing a water shortage. It is amazing. In Ireland, there is rain every day of the week but when it stops raining we do not have enough water to keep our population going. It shows the poor state of our water infrastructure. I am familiar with areas where the people are looking for tankers because water is not available. Magnesium levels are rising through the rocks and the water that is emerging is undrinkable. We must have a serious debate on how we will deal with this issue into the future. There are forecasts that there will be huge increases in the population between now and 2040 but we cannot serve the current population's water needs after a minor drought. How to deal with it will be a major issue for the State. When we return in the autumn, we must have a realistic debate on how to fund and ensure water services for our people. A new regime is required now to ensure people do not waste water over the next few weeks. There should be a ban on watering gardens, washing cars and so forth for the next few weeks, so we will have enough water for basic services. We will not have enough water for those services in two or three weeks if this drought continues. The rain supply is down 33% at present and we do not expect much change to occur.

Tacaím leis an méid atá ráite leis an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh mar gheall ar dhíospóireacht ó thaobh chúrsaí Gaeilge de. Tá sé thar am go mbeadh an díospóireacht sin againn anseo. Ba chóir go rachaidh sé ar aghaidh ar feadh dhá uair a chloig ar a laghad, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir féin. My last point is to support what Senator Bacik said about the recent report on conditions for children in direct provision. It is a matter of pride to this House that Members, collectively and across parties, have taken the matter of direct provision so seriously. A number of debates on the issue took place both in this Seanad and the previous one. Can we not, for the love of God, implement the report of the working group on direct provision, which was chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon? I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, be invited back to the House, but I know, because I was once in his position, that he is not necessarily the person with the last call on these issues. That is the Minister for Justice and Equality. There is a new Minister for Justice and Equality and he has expressed concern about, and interest in, this issue in the past. I ask the Leader to invite him to the House in the autumn, with the express intention of committing to implementing the McMahon report on the protection and direct provision systems. Many Members of this House want the direct provision system to be abolished, but we are simply asking that the McMahon report on the system, which is more than two years old and which was a compromise with the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that were invited to take part in the working group, be implemented to the letter and in full. That is not too much to ask in this day and age. We are scarring the lives of children, in particular, who are still in the direct provision system.

He is the Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament and is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with which Fianna Fáil is associated. Given Fianna Fáil's link with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we are delighted because a man of his calibre will have the right ideas where Ireland is concerned. I understand he is visiting Ireland on 21 September and it would be worthwhile and appropriate to have this important Member of the European Parliament address the Seanad, although not necessarily both Houses of the Oireachtas as was granted to Michel Barnier. The Seanad will play an increasing role in the continuing discussions and negotiations on Brexit. The report of the committee chaired by Senator Richmond was available at the 54th annual British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly which was held in Kilkenny last Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. It was snapped up at the event. I particularly noticed that our friends from the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party were anxious to obtain copies of this excellent report. I believe it will be of great assistance in the negotiations. Finally, I believe we should have a Brexit-type European house in Dublin. I suggest that Agriculture House be converted into a central location to focus attention on all aspects of the developing Brexit negotiations and that there be a dedicated team in that building to assist industry, agriculture and the other sectors of Irish life that will be affected post-Brexit.

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to the House to discuss the matter. Tourism in the midlands is at a serious juncture. Roscommon and east Galway do not fit into the Wild Atlantic Way or the Ancient East brand. Both of those initiatives have been very successful for their areas but the midlands have been very much neglected and forgotten by Fáilte Ireland. Fáilte Ireland's website prominently advertises Ireland's Ancient East, the Wild Atlantic Way and Dublin, but there is no mention of the midlands.I have been contacted by many in the hospitality sector in County Roscommon who are questioning their membership of Fáilte Ireland as a result of the lack of focus on and support for their business. Tourism will be a key element in the revitalisation of the economies of towns and villages right across the midlands. It has the potential to bring jobs and further revenue to support local businesses. Rathcroghan near Tulsk in County Roscommon, which is rich in ancient tombs and monuments, is the Tara of the west. It has been nominated tentatively for UNESCO world heritage status. It will play a very important role in the further development of tourism in our region. There is an urgent need for a midlands tourism brand to be developed. The midlands has much to offer in terms of tourism. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop an evidence-based tourism strategy for the region but we need to see evidence of its implementation. It is about affording the midlands an equal opportunity and a level playing field to attract tourists to our region. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Ross, to the House to discuss the matter.

There is an old saying that the sped arrow and the spoken word can never be retrieved. As irresponsible comments may bring embarrassment to the Oireachtas or the country, we need to be careful about what we say. With respect to what my colleague, Senator McFadden, said about bullying, I have requested a debate in the House solely devoted to bullying. Once it moves out of the child arena into the adult arena it should be a criminal offence. Bullying isolates the individual. It is an attack on the personality, mind and thinking of the individual. It is the most horrendous thing. I suffered it once in life and I will tell the House something for nothing, four years of my life was given over to being isolated in the workforce. I will never forget it. I found the courage to take on the bully and beat him at his own game. We need to have a proper discussion here. Nobody is exempt from bullying and nobody can escape the bully. At the end of the day, even big, ugly, bald guys like me can be bullied. It is something we need to realise and we must have protections in place. It should be a criminal offence. It certainly is a personal injuries issue. If we tackle it with adults, the chances are our children will be far more careful in what they do. I attended a school some years ago where two children had taken their own lives within a short time as a result of bullying. The teachers sat in their cars at night monitoring social media in order to be aware of what was going on among the children in the school. The Leader will know, because he is a teacher, that teachers take responsibility for children from 9 a.m. until they leave the school in the evening, but society expects the school to take responsibility 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Most people come in and out of here as if they are standing at a bus stop. People come in here and they do not listen to arguments. They may have plenty of other wonderful things to do but they do not even listen to the arguments. Sometimes they do not even know what they are voting for or against. They also use it as a back office. We can talk all we wish about reform, external reform, changing things for councillors and this, that or the other but we need to start with ourselves. It is disengaged, graceless and bad mannered a lot of the time. That is the first thing I want to say. I agree with reform and think we should start with ourselves. Whatever committee is going to do it, we should start with learning how to act in public and how to listen to one other. We should not be on phones and using the place as a back office when people are talking about very serious issues or issues that mean something to them and their constituents or localities. I suggest Senator Hopkins should listen to Garry Hynes's lecture on the greatness of Ballaghaderreen and her life there. I suggest the Senator should ring her up and ask what she should do about tourism in the midlands because she will not get an answer from Shane Ross.

On the positive side, CSO figures for 2016 indicated the number of suicides has reduced from 451 in 2015 to 399 in 2016. It is a welcome drop but we have a long way to go. The frightening part about the figure is that of the 399 who died as a result of suicide in 2016, 318 were men. It is an area we need to focus on. We need to do a lot of work on it to try to get the figure down again. I thank all the community groups and people working in this area because they are working effectively on bringing down the numbers. I also thank the people in the HSE and various State agencies who have worked in the area. It is something on which we need to continue to make progress over the next number of years. It had been increasing for quite a number of years. It was reduced in 2016 and hopefully that trend will carry into 2017. The other good figure from the health statistics is that the number of teenage pregnancies has reduced from 3,087 in 2001 to 1,098 in 2016. That is a 64% decrease, which is very welcome. It is to the credit of everyone involved in the education sector. We have a lot of work to do in that area because 1,098 is the number for 2016. There are good statistics available in respect of health and much good work is being done to which we do not give credit often enough. The area I am now working on is orphan drugs whereby a number of people with rare diseases cannot get access to medication quickly enough. We have a system here and I tabled a Commencement matter on the issue last week. It is taking too long and too many people are affected. We need to speed the process up. I ask the Leader that we deal with the delay in the processing of applications for orphan drugs in the autumn. It is extremely important and is something we need to do.

I join Senator Grace O'Sullivan in raising concern that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has just given consent to a company called Providence Resources to drill for oil and gas off the south-west coast of Ireland where it expects to find 5 billion barrels of oil. I find it hard to believe that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment would consider the granting of such a licence to be consistent with his aims to tackle climate change and meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, in particular because only a number of weeks ago, Ireland took the hugely positive step of banning onshore fracking. This decision is bad for our ecosystem, wildlife, carbon emissions and economy as all profits accrued will remain with the company with only a fractional benefit for Irish labourers. Will the Leader bring in the Minister to justify why he has made this decision? It flies in the face of everything Ireland says on a world stage about tackling climate change and moving to a green and energy-efficient Irish economy. Will the Leader ask the Minister whether he will consider revoking the licence given the significant opposition of environmental groups and NGOs?

Rank and file gardaí with whom I have spoken in recent weeks have told me that they, while on their beat, face an onslaught of allegations of corruption from ordinary members of the public. Something that I would otherwise have found hard to believe brought it home to me today, though. I was passing through a provincial town at 8.30 a.m. where a 40 year old chap was sitting at the window of a barber shop waiting to get in. As a Garda car passed by, this guy stuck his fingers up at it. I went to do a bit of work and so on and returned through the town when I happened to meet the Garda car at a petrol station. When I asked the gardaí what that had been about, they told me that they were used to it and that, over the past two years, respect for the Garda had been at an all-time low. There are problems in the Garda, although many are legacy problems. We are pillorying the Garda Commissioner about accounts and systems that were set up in the 1960s but, speaking as someone without an accountancy background, where are we going? I am sure that many mistakes have been made at the top echelons of the Garda and I am not here to defend the Commissioner or the top echelons, but we must be careful about what we want as a society. If we continue to hammer the Garda at every available opportunity, where will we go? If there is a problem with law and order or any other issue, we usually turn to gardaí. If we are not going to protect and back gardaí and place the full rigour of the law behind them, there will be a serious social problem in Ireland. It is happening now. There is a disconnect between people on the ground and the Garda. As we have been told by senior gardaí, there is a severe threat level of terrorist attack for the first time in 25 years, but gardaí will have a worse relationship with people on the ground, and it is not of their doing. I ask that every stakeholder, including senior politicians and the media, get behind rank and file gardaí. If we do not have rank and file gardaí operating correctly, we will have no State. That is the bottom line.

We attended a successful British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly plenary session in Kilkenny. I pay tribute to the co-chairs, Deputy Funchion of Sinn Féin and Mr. Andrew Rosindell, MP, of the Conservatives. I also pay tribute to the Oireachtas staff, who were incredible. The programme that they put on was brilliant. I am referring to the assembly because we need such links now more than ever thanks to Brexit. The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly was set up in 1990. A man in the assembly told me that, on its first day, there was a bombing in London and the divisions in the room between the Irish and UK parliamentarians were palpable. One would never have believed then the friendships, relationships and work that would develop in subsequent years. There are many such assemblies, including the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association, NSIPA, but we need more links. People do not realise that NSIPA members from the DUP, UUP, Alliance Party, SDLP and many others in Stormont met in this Chamber four years ago. It meets every six months. This work has gone unnoticed, but it forms part of the normalisation of politics north, south, east and west. I want to ensure that there is more of it. I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to tell the House what he is proposing. In light of Brexit, these links are more important than ever.

It has been debated for long enough. We are all aware of what it contains and there has not been a change in the law since 1927. The Bill is in line with the Government's alcohol awareness plan in the sense that, with pubs open on a Friday, it would cut out binge drinking and drinking in pubs and restaurants would be regulated as it has always been. I respect the traditional faith of this country and traders and customers would have the option of not opening or drinking. I look forward to passing the Bill's final Stages this afternoon.

Young people feel unsafe. These children were born into the system and confined to one room and four walls. They are not able to live normal lives or to develop as children should be. This is sowing the seeds for significant mental health problems down the line. We need to reject it. We know the reality of what it is like in these centres. This report shines another light on the scandalous conditions that children are living in in 2017. I call on the Minister to give an urgent response and engage with Seanad Éireann on this issue. I welcome the new drugs and alcohol strategy that was published this week, entitled "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025". Under this strategy, the devastating effect of addiction on families will be considered and the fact that addiction in the family is a family disorder, disease or however one would like to phrase it will be highlighted. Families need a separate recovery from the person in addiction. I wish to highlight the fact that a licence was awarded this morning for drilling in Kerry. It is vital that the licence be revoked by the Minister. What is happening is a disgrace.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	53	I welcome today's publication of the national climate change mitigation plan. I would welcome a debate on the matter. It is one of the issues of our time. The Government is often criticised for being lax or not wanting to pursue targets, but that is not true. At a high level, everyone agrees that something must be done. There is no dispute. Every day of the week, we are told that there has been a natural disaster, people cannot harvest their crops and so on in some part of the planet on account of climate change. I would like us to have a realistic debate about this, which I have not often heard in the Chamber. I have heard the Government being chastised and people beating their chests about this or that being terrible. I would like a debate on the question of the plan's desirability, with which most people agree, but let us first get down to the nitty gritty of how the plan will be implemented. Take the issue of fuel poverty, for example. We placed a carbon tax on coal, but those who are most affected are people who can least afford to change their heating systems to a green or renewable energy source. What about the cost to businesses, farms and households at a fragile time? We have just exited a bad economic situation and are facing into Brexit. What of renewable energy infrastructure? People are right to ask whether there will be further drilling for and harvesting of gas and oil and I watched a programme not too long ago about the need to close down peat-burning power stations for obvious reasons, but there is no debate about the economic impact that these factors will have on communities. What are the alternatives? Another issue arises as we try to hit our renewable heating and electricity targets. Friends of the Earth tell us about the targets that we ought to be achieving. I agree with it, but when a renewable energy project - a wind turbine or pylon - is to be built, it makes no contribution as to why the project should go there and how a community should be accommodated.There is no talk about communities, which have to accommodate this infrastructure, at all. Much of the debate is based in unreality. I would like to have a conversation about how we achieve these targets, taking on board the legitimate concerns.

I read an interesting piece on the Internet, which has its uses, about Airbnb. The Mayor of Vancouver is bringing in regulations whereby anyone using the site will have to register. It is quite a draconian measure but people can only register in respect of their own homes. They will be unable to register other properties they own with Airbnb. It will cost $54 to register and then an annual fee of $49 must be paid thereafter. The city expects that will free up a significant number of properties for rental. I appreciate this issue is being examined by the Government and there are ongoing discussions with Airbnb. While this is very much a Dublin-based issue, every day I meet constituents in Limerick who are complaining about the lack of availability of homes to rent. I meet single parents and families, and single men and women every day. It is not a gender, age or socioeconomic specific issue. In a spirit of cross-party harmony, I endorse everything Senator Davitt said about An Garda Síochána. There was an incident recently in Caherdavin, Limerick, which is a lovely area in which to live. Our local gardaí, from the Chief Superintendent, David Sheahan, to the superintendent, Derek Smart, performed above and beyond the call of duty. They were on call 24 hours and they could be rung any day or night. They dealt with the residents, there were gardaí on the ground and they attended public meetings. We have to separate, at times, corporate gardaí from gardaí on the ground. I can only speak from first hand experience in Limerick.

I compliment the co-chairpersons of the BIPA, Deputy Kathleen Funchion and Mr. Andrew Rosindell, MP, on their conduct of this week's plenary. Given the depth of the ties that bind us to Britain, it is important at this difficult time that we strengthen them in any way we can. It is unfortunate that in the current negotiations being led by Mr. Michel Barnier and Mr. David Davis, MP, London failed to engage in advice and consultation with Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The report this House produced was made available at the plenary and it was very much appreciated. It behoves us to strengthen our links with Britain in any way we can.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	60	I thank the 27 Members who contributed. I did my best to listen to everybody and capture everything they said. I apologise to Senator Devine, whom I missed out on yesterday in respect of the issues she raised regarding An Bord Altranais and the accreditation of nurses from the US. She raised an important point, which I hope the Minister will address when he comes to the House in the autumn. Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the second runway at Dublin Airport. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Attorney General are not procrastinating on this. It is a matter of a statutory instrument and competency in the area of noise management for which the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, is the lead agency. We must ensure we get this right. If there is a failure to do so, Senator Ardagh and her colleagues will be first to jump up and roar about it. To be fair to the Minister, due process is being undertaken in connection with the proposed runway. Second, I ask the Senator to read the Department's strategy, which contains a commitment to a parallel runway by 2020. I would like to refresh the memories of all Members. The DAA has made an application to Fingal County Council for a five-year extension of the planning permission in order that the runway permission will not become outdated. Noise management is an important issue for the residents of the area and it comes under the competence of the IAA. I assure Senator Ardagh that the Minister is very much committed to building a new runway. If it takes more time, let us make sure we get it right. The Senator also made reference to yesterday's report from the Committee of Public Accounts. In welcoming the report, it is about ensuring whatever the investigations, that we continue to shine a light on the culture and practices within An Garda Síochána as part of the ongoing process of reform initiated by the previous Government and continued by the current Government. Investigations are being undertaken by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission on foot of referral by the Commissioner of suspected fraudulent activity in respect of certain EU training funds. There is also a need, as I said yesterday, to expedite the civilianisation of An Garda Síochána to provide for a new perspective on management of gardaí. Senators Davitt and Ó Domhnaill have in one way encapsulated that we need to reaffirm and work with an gnáth garda, the man and woman on the street, and with the inspector or superintendent who is working flat out in community policing in a variety of ways. They deserve not just our support and respect, but our affirmation. They do a job in difficult times, often at unsocial hours, and we must support them. There is an obligation to transform the culture within the force and the only way to do that is to ensure we get to the bottom of the cancer that exists within it in order that we can have a force that we can be even more proud of. As a Government, we have invested in the Garda. Pay restoration is happening and there has been investment in different sections of the force. I would be happy to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House in the autumn. The interim audit report into the Garda Training College published in March 2017 made 19 recommendations. Five have been fully implemented, five are partially completed and nine are in progress. Complex legal issues arise from the report and we were all disappointed to read some of the outcomes in it. Senator Craughwell referred to the use of words and language. Our party founded the Garda and all those who have supported the force since the foundation of the State will stand by it but we must also ensure there is cultural reform. Senators McDowell, Higgins, Bacik and O'Donnell referred to the need to continue the process of Seanad reform. All of us are very much committed to reforming the House. There has been strong cross-party co-operation in this Seanad and, as Leader, I have been clear that I will work with all Members regarding the internal workings of the House, the passage of legislation and how we do our business. Seanad reform is not as black and white as the populist manifesto included in Senator McDowell's election literature. It invites a variety of views and opinions. I am very much looking forward to working with all Senators to ensure that at the end of this Seanad we will have a reformed Seanad that can be passed on to the next Seanad Éireann. I accept the intention of Senator McDowell's motion on the Order of Business to give, and to imbue in all of us, the spirit of co-operation rather than to have a divided House. I will work with everyone but it is a two-way street. As the Leader of the House it sometimes feels as though I am on a cul-de-sac or on a revolving roundabout that seems to only go in one direction. I will persevere. I know the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the Government are committed to bringing about reform. The question that needs to be posed by all Members of the House is "What do you want to see in a reformed Seanad and what does it actually mean?" Many Members of the House will go on the national airwaves, will write articles and will come in to debate here, but they do not stand for anything-----

Senator Alice-Mary Higgins made a reference to the 1979 referendum. I am confident we will get there. I want to go back to the comments made about the issue of decorum and listening. Senator O'Donnell makes a very good point because at the risk of sounding pompous - which I am not - there are Senators who come in here to the Order of Business and they then skidaddle before they get a reply. To be fair some of them apologise for leaving. If we are to be honest some of the Members of the House do not want to listen at all. Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell is correct in that regard. I appeal to all Senators to take a reflective pause in some of the contributions. There are some very fine contributions made from across the House by Senators who deserve to be listened to. In the past the Cathaoirleach has spoken about the use of mobile phones and other devices in the Chamber. I use mine to get information so I can reply to the Order of Business, but it is a good point and may be a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Senator McDowell spoke of the situation in the Mediterranean Sea. It is a huge crisis and a humanitarian issue. I am very proud of the men and women of the Naval Service who have saved thousands of lives in the region. There is a moral duty on all governments to act collectively in trying to end this nightmare in the Mediterranean Sea. If one speaks with members of the Naval Service who have come home they will speak of the horror of the nightmare they have endured and of the terror they have seen. I commend these men and women for the work they do. The point was made by Senator McDowell that we need to have a real debate on it and I would hope this could happen in the new Seanad term. Senator Conway-Walsh spoke of the issues around group water schemes and the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services. It is an example of how a Senator in this House, Senator Ó Céidigh in this case, can be praised for chairing this committee. Just in case the Sinn Féin Senators did not know, the Government invests millions of euro on a multi-annual basis in group water schemes. Last year it was nearly €15 million, which was an increase of 30% on 2015. Of course we do not hear about this from Sinn Féin because it is good news and they do not want to hear that. There is a philosophical question around investment in water. In his contribution, Senator Lombard said that in parts of Cork there is a 90% decrease and in some parts of Carrigaline there may be no water in ten days' time. We must invest in our water infrastructure. The Sinn Féin Party does not recognise that this money does not fall off the trees. It must come from somewhere. This Government and the last government made a decision to invest in water. I would ask the Sinn Féin Senators to reflect on the role their colleagues played in the Assembly in Northern Ireland in this regard, how they pay for water in the North and how they allocated money for that. We have seen investment in group water schemes and the former Minister, Phil Hogan brought in the grant for the inspection of sewerage systems to ensure the water table is of pristine quality. I commend the men and women who work in and administer group water schemes. For a generation they have, on a voluntary basis in many cases, done Trojan work in rural Ireland providing water. We must ensure that the multi-annual funding by Government of group water schemes continues. The expert group that was set up by then Minister, Deputy Coveney, allows for places such as Galway and Mayo, and other parts of the State, to have group water schemes set up and we must see this continue. The Government must prioritise this issue because we cannot-----

We cannot compromise on water quality. The Expert Commission on the Future Funding of Domestic Public Water Services speaks about equality. We want to see equality. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, chaired by Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh, recommended there would be an enhanced budget for small group water schemes. This is a priority for the Government and is happening as we speak with a process under way. Underpinning this is the presence by Irish Water of investment plans in the improvement of water quality and in the infrastructure. In my city of Cork we are pumping raw sewage into Cork Harbour. We cannot allow this to continue to happen. We must take action but this will cost money. The philosophical question that has not been addressed by some people is "Where does the money come from?" Do they want to increase taxation on the ordinary citizen? Senators must face this question themselves. Senators Lynn Ruane, Grace O'Sullivan, Ivana Bacik and Michelle Mulherin raised the issues of climate change, the national mitigation plan and licensing. I have not got the information on revoking the licences but I can tell the Senators that the Cabinet is meeting today to discuss climate change. The Government is committed to implementing 100 actions around climate change, decarbonisation and ensuring Ireland has a reduction in carbon emissions. The Minister, Deputy Naughten will be in the House today to discuss the Minerals Development Bill 2015. Maybe the Senators could have a conversation with the Minister as part of that debate. If it is not relevant to that Bill I would be happy to have that debate in the autumn. Senators McFadden and Craughwell raised the issue of bullying. I commend the founder of the I'm A Friend organisation, Charlie Wynne, whom I have met. It is important we continue the work being done by a former Minister, Ruairí Quinn and now by the Minister, Deputy Bruton around the issue of bullying and its inclusion on the curriculum in schools. It is an important issue that has not gone away. Senators Bacik, Ó Ríordáin and Black raised the issue of the report on children in direct provision. The report makes for a very disappointing and upsetting read. As Senator Ó Ríordáin has rightly said, it is important that the actions from the McMahon report are implemented in full. If one visits a direct provision centre one comes away with an absolute need to see action continue and, in this case, to be concluded. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton are working on the matter. I would ask that all Members would read the report of the consultation we are debating here because it is a very honest reflection, especially of the young people involved, and is one we need to see. The report should not gather dust on a shelf or just receive a headline in a newspaper; there needs to be direct action by the Government. Action is being taken. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton are committed to implementing the recommendations of the McMahon report and, as Senator Ó Ríordáin has alluded to, we have had debates in this House. We will continue to do so. To be fair, as the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and now as the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton has committed to the implementation, as has the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan. I would be happy to have that debate in the House in the autumn. It is about ensuring that there is an end to direct provision. Senator Gallagher raised the issue of body cameras for members of An Garda Síochána. It is an operational matter but I would certainly be happy to see the report referred to by the Senator introduced.Labhair an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh mar gheall ar ár dteanga dúchais. Bhí díospóireacht againn faoin Ghaeilge san earrach agus beidh díospóireacht eile againn faoi san fhómhar. Tá mé cinnte go dtiocfaidh an tAire Stáit, an Teachta McHugh, isteach. Is mór an phribhléid é go bhfuil an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh, mar dhuine ón nGaeltacht, in ann cúrsaí a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht agus lenár dteanga dúchais a phlé sa Teach seo as a very good ambassador for the Gaeltacht and Irish language in this House. We have had debates in the past. The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, is very much looking forward to resuming duty as Minister of State responsible for the Gaeltacht. We will have that debate. We will see an extension of the Senator's Commencement matter of yesterday because it is important that there is a 20-year plan for the Irish language as a living language. Today and this weekend in the city of Cork the Munster Fleadh Ceol will take place, which ensures our language and culture are promoted and that we all use them. I welcome the Senator's remarks and look forward to that debate.  Senators O'Reilly and Lawless referred to the Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2017, which is before the House today and I am happy to take it to its conclusion today. I gave a commitment on behalf of the Government to Senators McDowell and Lawless on that. The issue is a matter of opinion. I will be happy to let the debate unfurl and to have that discussion.  I am not aware of the issue about family resource centres in An Tusla raised by Senator Gavan. This Government and its predecessor have increased and restored the minimum wage and terms and conditions of those on low pay. I am not aware of the pay and conditions of those in the family resource centres but if Senator Gavan sends me an email about that I will be happy to bring it to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  In response to Senator Lombard, it is important to have infrastructure for the provision of clean drinking water.  Senators Leyden, Coghlan and Feighan referred to Brexit and the British Irish Parliamentary Association, BIPA, and North-South relations. This arises in the context of the report from the House of Lords today which is particularly worrying given that there is no devolved Government yet in the North of our country but I hope there will be. It is important, as Senator Feighan said, that the normalisation of politics continues and that we continue to draw on the friendships, expertise, benefits and experience we gain from these interparliamentary groups.  Senator Leyden referred to Guy Verhofstadt. I think there will be a motion before the House tomorrow on that and I will be happy to deal with it then.  Senator Hopkins referred to the tourism strategy for the midlands, Roscommon and east Galway. That needs to be addressed because it does fall between Ireland’s Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way. Senator Marie-Louise O’Donnell who does snippets on the "Today with Sean O’Rourke" programme would be a very good ambassador for Roscommon and east Galway.

What we say and how we say it is heard, does implicate us and has an import. It is important we choose our words carefully. Sometimes we do not do that but we should. Senator Colm Burke referred to health and I welcome the good news he gave of the reduction in numbers of those who have taken their own lives. The problems for men need to be addressed. There was a good item on "Morning Ireland" this morning about men's sheds in Mullingar and the need for men to look after themselves. There are many organisations providing supports and services for those with mental health problems. No person should feel alone, isolated or vulnerable. It is important to talk, seek advice and help. I appeal to all people but particularly men, as Senator Colm Burke said, to reach out, talk and engage. He also referred to the 64% reduction in teenage pregnancies in 15 years. It is an extraordinary decrease. He also referred to orphan drugs and people with rare diseases trying to access medication, an issue that has raised its head in recent weeks. The Health Service Executive, HSE, must address this and I would be happy to work with him on that.  Senator Davitt's remarks were among the most sensible contributions in the House for a long time about An Garda Síochána. It is important to reaffirm the work done by our rank and file.  I mentioned Senators Lawless and Black, and yesterday the national alcohol strategy was discussed on the Order of Business.  In response to Senator Mulherin's comments on climate change and the national mitigation plan, it is important to have a realistic, reasonable and rational debate on renewable energy, farming and business, and the costs, notwithstanding that we have commitments to live up to.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell mentioned Airbnb and the Canadian model. The former Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and data protection, Deputy Dara Murphy, following a request from Senator Humphreys, was considering Airbnb but we should consider it again. I would be happy to have a debate in the House on that issue.  I am happy to accept Senator Ó Ríordáin's amendment to the Order of Business. In the interests of co-operation and the spirit of bipartisanship we should all address the issue of Seanad reform but not as if it was the first fence in the Grand National, as a race to see who can get what. It is a question of how we can do so in a manner that can progress the need for reform. I accept both amendments and thank the Senators for them.

It is being brought forward to give effect to one among a number of commitments arising under the Stormont agreement and implementation plan, known as the Fresh Start agreement. Senators will recall that in September 2015 the Irish and British Governments convened a talks process in Northern Ireland to address the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement of 2014, as well as trust and confidence issues stemming from the legacy of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland that had led to difficulties at the Northern Ireland Executive in the course of 2015. Following ten weeks of talks, the Fresh Start agreement was concluded on 17 November 2015. The agreement provides a roadmap for the implementation of many aspects of the Stormont House Agreement of 23 December 2014, including measures to support institutional reform at the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive and financial and welfare reform in Northern Ireland. The agreement also sets out a strategic approach for ending paramilitarism in Northern Ireland and tackling organised crime, especially cross-Border crime. It contains a firm commitment to achieving a society free of paramilitarism, to working for the disbandment of all paramilitary organisations and their structures and to challenging paramilitary attempts to control communities. An important thread that ran through the talks was the need to seek to tackle the legacy of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland on a cross-cutting basis to see it as a whole of society issue, rather than solely through the lens of security and policing. In this regard, among the key elements of the agreement is the establishment of the joint agency task force as provided for in the agreement. The task force is a cross-Border, multi-agency body which has been established in order to enhance co-operation between police, revenue and other law enforcement agencies, at both strategic and operational levels, in tackling cross-Border organised crime. It is led by the police and revenue services in both jurisdictions and it has been taking forward a range of targeted actions to tackle serious criminal activities that exploit the Border and impact particularly on Border communities. Another key element is the Northern Ireland Executive's strategy to end paramilitarism. In line with the agreement, the Executive appointed an expert panel to develop recommendations for the disbandment of paramilitary groups. The panel comprised Lord John Alderdice, Professor Monica McWilliams and Mr. John McBurney and it reported to the Executive in June 2016. Based on the panel's report, the Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime on 19 July 2016. The action plan adopts an Executive-wide strategic approach to measures aimed at ending paramilitary activity, including measures to promote a culture of lawfulness, to support persons moving away from paramilitary activity to do so, to tackle criminality linked to paramilitaries and to address broader societal challenges, such as educational and economic disadvantage that is often exploited by paramilitary organisations. The Fresh Start agreement also provides for the establishment by the two Governments of a body to monitor and report on the implementation of the various measures in the agreement aimed at ending paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. This body is the independent reporting commission. In my previous capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I signed an international agreement between Ireland and the UK on the establishment of the independent reporting commission on 13 September 2016. The agreement, which is included in the Schedule to the Bill, outlines the agreed structure, functions, objectives and other necessary arrangements for the commission, and the Bill before the House will provide for those in law. It is the intention that reporting on the implementation of the Executive's action plan will be a priority for the commission in order to help to support and to ensure its implementation by the Northern Executive. The Bill has 12 sections which provide for the establishment of the commission in accordance with the terms of the international agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom. Section 1 contains the definitions of terms used in the Bill. Section 2 provides for the establishment and status of the commission as an independent body with the legal capacity of a body corporate. Section 3 articulates the objective and functions of the commission. Those are as set out in the agreement between the Governments establishing the commission and they follow directly from the Fresh Start agreement. The commission's primary objective is the promotion of progress towards ending paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland in the interests of long-term peace and stability in society, and stable and inclusive devolved Government in Northern Ireland. The functions of the commission in relation to the remaining threat of paramilitary activity will be to report on the progress that is being made towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland. Section 4 provides that the Minister shall provide the commission, on a basis to be determined by the Government, with funding, premises, facilities and other services as may be necessary for its proper functioning. The costs of the commission will be shared between the two Governments. Section 5 provides for the necessary privileges, immunities and inviolabilities of the commission. Section 6 sets out certain duties on the commission in the performance of its functions, notably that it shall not do anything that might put at risk the life or safety of any person, have a prejudicial effect in Ireland or the UK on national security interests, legal proceedings, or the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of crime. The provisions in sections 5 and 6 are particularly important given the obviously sensitive nature of the matters with which the commission will be dealing. They are also important in ensuring that there is no unintentional interference with the work of An Garda Síochána and the PSNI in their ongoing work to tackle paramilitary groups and criminal gangs North and South. Section 7 provides for controls on the disclosure of information obtained in the performance of its functions unless authorised by or on behalf of the commission and it also facilitates co-operation between the commission and An Garda Síochána. The lifespan anticipated for the commission in the course of the Fresh Start agreement talks was about five years and section 8 provides for the future dissolution of the commission by mutual agreement of the two Governments. Section 9 amends the Freedom of Information Act 2014 to preclude the application of the Freedom of Information Act to the commission. That is required by the nature of the sensitive information that the commission will deal with. Section 10 provides for the laying of the commission's reports to the two Governments before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The commission will report at least annually. Sections 11 and 12 are standard provisions for legislation relating to the expenses arising being paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and the Short Title and commencement arrangements. As provided for in the Fresh Start agreement, the commission will be a four-member body and the Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive have advanced matters by nominating the four commissioners. The Irish Government has nominated Mr. Tim O'Connor, a former Secretary General to the President and a respected former diplomat. The British Government has nominated Mr. Mitchell Reiss, who was the United States Special Envoy to Northern Ireland between 2003 and 2007. The Northern Ireland Executive has nominated Mr. John McBurney, a well-known and respected Northern Ireland solicitor, and Professor Monica McWilliams, who has a long experience in politics and public service in Northern Ireland. John McBurney and Monica McWilliams were members of the Executive's Expert Panel on the Disbandment of Paramilitaries which reported in June 2016. All four nominated commissioners have extensive experience of the situation in Northern Ireland and they will have the full support of the Irish and British Governments and of the parties in Northern Ireland in bringing forward their work. Of course, the Seanad will know well that there is an ongoing process of talks at Stormont aimed at establishing the Executive following the Assembly elections earlier this year. While much progress has been made in reaching agreement on a range of important issues, it has not yet proved possible to finalise an agreement that will facilitate the formation of the Executive for the time being. That is, of course, a disappointment. The Government maintains its strong, ongoing commitment to the success of the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement and we will continue to play our full part in supporting the resumption of power sharing in Northern Ireland. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has encouraged all the parties in Northern Ireland to maintain contact with each other over the coming weeks with the aim of securing agreement at the earliest opportunity. This Bill is not without precedent and it follows in many respects the arrangements that were successfully put in place in regard to other bodies established to further the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement, notably the Independent Monitoring Commission; a cross-Border institution established by Senator McDowell when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The independent reporting commission will have an important role to play in bringing forward work aimed at bringing an end to paramilitarism and its insidious legacy that impacts on all communities in Northern Ireland. I look forward to finalising the Bill at the earliest opportunity and to commencing the important work of the commission.

I believe he will be here later on as well.Fianna Fáil supports this legislation, which is one of the key outcomes of the Fresh Start agreement of November 2015. The Bill creates a new monitoring body to review and report on any paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. It is a damning indictment of Sinn Féin and the DUP that such a body is still required almost 20 years on from the Good Friday Agreement. The peace process was always about more than the absence of violence. However, the zero-sum attitudes taken by the two main parties which has led to the current impasse in Stormont has hobbled the immense potential and optimism of the Good Friday Agreement. This sterile political environment has allowed paramilitaries to continue to blight both communities in Northern Ireland. This Bill was necessitated by MI5 and the PSNI confirming the continued existence of the IRA and its role in formulating Sinn Féin policy. Sinn Féin has fundamental questions to answer around its links to the IRA, which has no part in the democratic state. It is now time for Sinn Féin and the DUP to move beyond tribal partisanship and work to ensure Northern Ireland is capable of addressing the challenge of Brexit. The Bill ultimately arises from the Fresh Start agreement. However, Northern Ireland remains engulfed in yet another political crisis, which has led to the protracted paralysis in the institutions. The lack of progress in getting the institutions up and running is deeply disappointing and underlines our concern that zero-sum politics is sustaining a fertile ground for paramilitaries. Due to the tight numbers in the House of Commons following the recent elections to the British Parliament, the Tory Government is reliant on DUP support. The DUP has secured a deal worth £2 billion over two years and further flexibility around £500 million already committed. It appears to bypass the Barnett formula used to allocate funding across the component nations of the United Kingdom. This has drawn criticism from other devolved administrations. We hope that a focus is placed on key Stormont House and Fresh Start measures such as the A5 motorway to Derry, which will be a key piece of infrastructure for the north west, and the Narrow Water bridge, which should be completed. The Irish Government should uphold its commitment to those measures. The botched renewable heating incentive scheme could cost up to £490 million and has acted as the catalyst for this crisis. However, behind the immediate problems lies a deeper malaise that has afflicted the institutions over the past number of years. The political system has to move on from this addiction to crisis politics. Over the past few years, there have been annual problems with the institutions, punctuated by a series of new agreements and arrangements designed to keep the system ticking over. Since 2013, there have been the Haas talks, the Stormont House agreement and the Fresh Start agreement, all aimed at reinvigorating a stagnant political process. History has shown it requires both Governments to fully and honestly engage in order to keep the peace process moving forward. The DUP's leverage cannot be allowed to stymie progress and undermine long-established British policy for the sake of short-term political gain. Likewise, Sinn Féin has painted itself into a corner and must have the honesty to agree a way out of this impasse. With Brexit looming, all parties need to work together to ensure there is no hard border. It is time for real maturity and leadership from all of us on the island.
#NiallODonnghaile	unknown-#NiallODonnghaile-party	unknown-#NiallODonnghaile-dob	unknown-#NiallODonnghaile-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	86	My contribution does not mention Fianna Fáil half as much as Sinn Féin was mentioned in the Fianna Fáil contribution. While I do not take huge issue with Senator Ardagh personally because it is clear from her contribution that she has been handed a speech to recite in regard to this issue, I do have to pull the Fianna Fáil Party up on a number of points. Coming just a few short weeks after the UDA murdered a man in the car park of a Sainsbury's supermarket in Bangor, Fianna Fáil got up in this House and started to tell Sinn Féin it needs to reflect on the IRA, which left the stage in 2005. That, of course, was verified by a whole raft of organisations, North and South and internationally, and by bodies appointed by the Government. Its decommissioning was overseen by the Rev. Harold Good and the late Fr. Alec Reid, and I do not imagine Fianna Fáil will call into question the bona fides of those individuals. I do find it interesting that Fianna Fáil, in the form of hurlers on the ditch - in fact, all-Ireland winning hurlers on the ditch when it comes to politics in the North - is saying this to Sinn Féin, which, I remind the House, received its biggest ever mandate since the partition of the country and overwhelmingly significant endorsement from the people in the North, while Fianna Fáil received zero votes there. The people there are very clear in regard to the Sinn Féin stance on these matters. The issue of rights, Acht na Gaeilge, marriage equality and victims and legacy issues should not simply be parked and set aside. I wonder what rights the members of Fianna Fáil would ask their children, families, neighbours and constituents to compromise in this jurisdiction. Would it be Irish language rights, the right to marry the person one loves or the right to access a proper legacy inquest into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, for example? Is that what Fianna Fáil is telling nationalist and republican people, and many people from the unionist and loyalist tradition in the North, to park, and all simply because it wants to have the opportunity to grandstand and take political sideswipes at Sinn Féin in advance of the summer recess? I will not be distracted and I do not think people in the North will be particularly enamoured. It is very clear those issues will not be parked for the sake of returning to the status quo and what passed previously. Those days are very clearly over. To return to the business at hand, I welcome the Bill, which gives effect to the international agreement between the Irish and British Governments in September last year to establish the independent reporting commission. This commission mechanism was agreed as part of the Fresh Start agreement in November 2015 which Sinn Féin negotiated and supported, along with other parties - I do not think Fianna Fáil was there. All and any steps that contribute to the ending of violence and criminality on our island are to be welcomed. The establishment of the independent reporting commission is a positive step forward in that regard. Its objective, as outlined in section 3 of the Bill, is to support long-term peace and stability. No one in this House can argue against all of that and it is what all of us want to see - peaceful communities and a peaceful country. There are those, however, who do not want to see that objective fulfilled. The continued activity of so-called paramilitary groups impedes the development of peace, imposes hardship and inflicts great harm on citizens and communities. The Bill before us rightly reflects the need for greater all-Ireland co-operation to tackle crime and criminal activity. I welcome the realisation of both Governments and all parties, North and South, that we are better able to tackle issues like this on an all-island basis. The argument has been made here many times that together we are better equipped to tackle the big issues that face all of us on the island. Sinn Féin is totally and absolutely opposed to criminality of all kinds and we stand with communities across this island, with An Garda Síochána and with the PSNI in opposing criminal gangs and criminality in all its forms. As a consequence, Sinn Féin members' homes, my own included, and their families been attacked. Our party will continue to try to reach out to others and to robustly face down violent loyalism and so-called republican dissidents. Despite that fact, there have been deliberate efforts, some of which we have heard here today, to criminalise and demonise republicans, Sinn Féin activists and other citizens, especially those in cross-Border communities in places like south Armagh and north Louth. Contrary to the image portrayed by some elements in the media and some in this House, such portraits are a fallacy, conjured up for the purposes of pathetic political point-scoring. There is no doubt that criminal gangs which masquerade as republicans, for whatever reason, exist. They are not republicans; they are criminals. No doubt, the independent reporting commission will come to that same conclusion. There is also a major problem relating to ongoing loyalist paramilitary violence which should concern us all. The recent killing of Colin Horner, purportedly as a result of a feud within the UDA, is deeply concerning and there can be no room for such grievous acts in a civilised society. I urge those involved to stop now in the interests of all citizens. The independent reporting commission is a mechanism on which we can all agree. It was agreed as a result of all-party talks and agreement between both Governments. The latest round of talks in the North have, regrettably, not proven successful, despite the very best efforts of Sinn Féin to find agreement with the DUP, the other parties and the two Governments on outstanding issues. It is disappointing but perhaps not surprising that a deal has not been done. Such a result is a direct consequence of the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, supporting the DUP and the DUP supporting her. The DUP which, of course, was strangely absent from the Fianna Fáil contribution, had the endorsement of the Loyalist Communities Council ahead of the last Westminster election, certainly giving cause for concern among many of us. It is a monumental failure by Theresa May and her Government. Decades of work are being put on hold to keep her in power.It should be very clear by now that a restored Assembly and Executive are only sustainable and tenable if they are based on fairness, respect and equality. The rights-based issues, whether they be Acht na Gaeilge, a Bill of rights, marriage equality, the rights of families to coroners' inquests, independent investigations or information recovery, are not solely Sinn Féin demands but are citizens' demands and are basic rights that are protected in England, Scotland, Wales and the rest of Ireland. The denial of these rights would not be tolerated elsewhere on these islands and should not be tolerated in the North. However, the British Government is prepared to facilitate such a failure because it is in hock to the DUP. It is prepared to say "No" to fundamental human rights to appease its partners in the DUP, which is unacceptable. Sinn Féin was and is prepared to work through the issues and we will continue to try to do that. We will not tolerate the denial of basic human rights. It should not be a shock to anyone that unionist parties want to delay, nor that they come to the issue of rights slowly and reluctantly, but they cannot do that forever. The Sinn Féin electorate will not consent to be governed by the DUP on the DUP's terms. We do not and would not expect the DUP electorate to consent to be governed by us on Sinn Féin's terms either. It is quite simple. It is all about rights, equality and respect. It is about agreement on how these rights and our agreements are to be delivered and implemented. That is the only way to get the institutions back up and in place. I support the Bill.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	87	I welcome the Minister and thank the parties opposite for their support for, and endorsement of, the Bill. The best any of us can do for the negotiations in the North is wish the parties well in their endeavours to find an agreement. It is in the interests of all Irish citizens, North and South, to find an agreement and I have no doubt that all parties will play a constructive role. I commend the previous Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on the many long hours and days he spent up North engaging with the parties in a constructive manner, and I have no doubt his replacement, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, will learn from his example and continue that engagement. I see this Bill as another fundamental building block in the ongoing process of peace on this island. It was appropriate that the Minister acknowledged the role our colleague, Senator Michael McDowell, played as Minister for Justice and Equality. Indeed, all Governments and Ministers for the past decade and a half have been constructive in their engagement to ensure the peace continues. It is a fragile peace and probably will be fragile for another couple of generations. This Bill is part of the agreement. I wish the four designated appointed commissioners well. They have vast experience and it is an important job of work. Going from a paramilitary background to mainstream society brings its challenges and the Bill is about the State engaging in a positive way to ensure there is a framework in place to deal with it. The Minister has outlined the 12 provisions of the Bill and it is fairly straightforward. This is our responsibility and the Oireachtas has a duty of care to ensure it passes without delay. The full agreement of this House is very welcome in this regard.
#FrancesBlack	unknown-#FrancesBlack-party	unknown-#FrancesBlack-dob	unknown-#FrancesBlack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	88	I welcome the Minister and I welcome the independent reporting commission. I hope this will be another step towards achieving a society free from paramilitarism. This will help provide stability and peace in a society that has been plagued by violence for many years. The shared futures agreement promised to build hope and confidence throughout the North and to establish true reconciliation. While this has not been fully achieved yet, we must build a society based on equality and justice because this is the best way to ensure paramilitary activity will cease. My father comes from Rathlin Island off north Antrim, and during the conflict we spent our summer holidays there. Rathlin is a small island but, while one would see the army in Belfast, the island led the way in non-sectarian politics. The community always worked together no matter what part people came from, and they still do that to this day. The people there lead by great example and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is taking a trip up to Rathlin in September. Maybe the Minister would like to join us. It would be lovely if he came to meet the community there. The fears of some communities are being exploited by paramilitary organisations for their own financial gain. This must not be tolerated, and support for independent community organisations must be maintained. The most deprived areas are those most affected by paramilitary activity and more investment and services in these communities will help decrease the influence of the paramilitary organisations, more than any policing or security measures. The re-establishment of the Northern Executive is of the utmost importance if this Bill is to be effective because the elected representatives in the North must work together to rid society of all paramilitary activity. To this end it is necessary that the equality agenda is implemented and outstanding issues from previous agreements are addressed. I know this is a very difficult situation and I wish all parties well in re-establishing the Northern Executive. With the start of the Brexit negotiations it is more important than ever that the Northern Executive is up and running and both the Irish and British Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, must ensure the issues leading to the suspension of the Executive are resolved. I welcome the enactment of this legislation and I hope it can be an important step towards building a better future for all communities in the North.

This is an important aspect of the progress being made under the peace process. The Minister referred to the unfortunate stalemate in Stormont and the disappointment over the failure to date to get the Northern Ireland Executive up and running again. There has been an interruption to the process by the elections, and colleagues in the North have suggested to me that election fatigue had set in among many citizens in Northern Ireland following all the election and referendum processes through which they have been in recent years. It is good to see initiatives such as this Bill coming forward which will see the establishment of an international body, the independent reporting commission, to report on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland. I thank the library and research service for preparing for us a very good synopsis for the context of the Bill and giving us an important reminder that there are ongoing levels of paramilitary activity. The PSNI recorded security situation statistics annual report for the past year, from April 2016 to 31 March 2017, provides a chilling reminder that deaths and casualties continue, even with an established peace process in place. In the timeframe to which I referred, there were five security related deaths and there has been one more since, in May this year. The five deaths between April 2016 and March 2017 also represent a high level of activity compared with previous years and is the highest number per year since the 2008-2009 reporting session. On top of fatalities there have been 61 shooting incidents and 29 bombing incidents. There are ongoing casualties and individuals and families are being grievously affected on an ongoing basis by paramilitary groups and individuals. It is important we recall that while we speak in support of this legislation. I join others in wishing the best of luck to the four members of the commission: Mitchell Reiss, Tim O'Connor, Monica McWilliams and John McBurney. In particular, I welcome the inclusion of Professor Monica McWilliams, who has a proud record of public service, in particular in ensuring there is representation of women in the Northern Ireland public sphere and in political debate through her work with the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition.For those of us not from Northern Ireland, the lack of women at high levels in political life in Northern Ireland is a constant source of concern. It has perhaps improved in more recent times but certainly over many years we have seen an absence of women in public debate in Northern Ireland. It is great to see Monica McWilliams as a member of the commission for that reason, apart from her own stellar record.  I join others in supporting the Bill. I wish the commission the best of luck with its arduous task.

I very much welcome the broad support that has been expressed in the House for the Bill and for the objectives and work of the independent reporting commission. I acknowledge that traditionally there has been cross-party support in the Seanad for measures that have been brought forward over the years to support the process of seeking full and stable peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, building on the many achievements, initiatives and programmes of all Governments throughout the decades during the very difficult times of the Troubles and beyond. I am very pleased to note that this cross-party approach has been maintained and I thank Senators for that. It is the firm intention of the Government to do what we can towards achieving a society that will be free of the scourge of paramilitarism. We will work with our colleagues in the Executive in Northern Ireland, as soon as it has been established, and also with the British Government with the aim of disbanding all paramilitary organisations and their structures, activities and what they stand for. I have no doubt that the commission will play a positive role in that regard. The Bill, and the measure to which it gives effect, fully underlines the strong importance we all attach to positive developments not only in politics on the island of Ireland but also in respect of society on the island of Ireland and the economy, North and South, which will benefit everybody across the island.  I once again thank the Senators for their contributions. I look forward to hopefully completing Committee, Report and Final Stages of the Bill before the Seanad rises for the summer vacation. That would be some good news coming from Seanad Éireann in the form of our contribution towards ensuring the establishment of the important independent reporting commission in Northern Ireland.

There are a number of Government amendments to it. As Senators will be aware, the Bill, as published, provides for a number of amendments to section 2 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927 which, incidentally, was introduced and piloted through this House by one of my predecessors, the first Minister for Justice, Kevin O'Higgins, who represented my constituency, and the 90th anniversary of whose assassination we commemorated just last week. I want to acknowledge his contribution over a wide range of issues not least in the matter of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927. My understanding is that during the course of debate on this important Bill in 1927 it was the intention of the then Minister, Kevin O'Higgins, to introduce a consolidated piece of legislation in the matter of intoxicating liquor dealing with statutes, some of which dated back at far as 1634 and many of which were enacted during the course of the 19th century. Of course, we now know that did not happen. Ninety years later we are still awaiting a consolidated single statute. I am not going to suggest that during the course of my Ministry that we will have one but I acknowledge the contribution of Senators Lawless, Boyhan, Craughwell and McDowell in this regard. Perhaps over the summer months, while enjoying a well earned vacation, if the same Independent Senators find themselves somewhat idle or in need of a project, they might like to assist in the drafting of the comprehensive and consolidated intoxicating liquor Act that Kevin O'Higgins did not get around to doing in 1927. These Government amendments would remove some restrictions to Good Friday operations. As for the amendments to section 2, having regard to the complexity of the licensing code, the Bill as drafted, while acknowledging its importance, could in certain circumstances unless amended create further anomalies. Indeed, it could unintentionally create some unfair trading conditions for certain categories of licenses premises. That is why the purpose of my amendments is to ensure that all of the provisions in the licensing Acts that prohibit the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday are removed in their entirety. Amendment No. 1 inserts the correct collective citation of the Licensing Acts in section 1 of the Bill. Amendment No. 2 provides for a number of amendments to the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927. It also incorporates the amendments to section 2 of the Act that is set out in the Bill as published, which would permit the sale of intoxicating liquor in public houses and off-licences on Good Friday. Amendment No. 2 also amends sections 1(1), 4(7), 14 and 56(1) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927. In practice this will mean that the restriction on the sale of intoxicating liquor in hotels and the restriction on the sale of intoxicating liquor in registered clubs on Good Friday will also be subject to removal. The provision will retain the current symmetry between the rules of registered clubs and licensed premises on the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday. It will also mean that hotels will be permitted to sell intoxicating liquor to paying guests at any time on Good Friday and not only for consumption with a meal as is currently the law. Amendment No. 3 provides for the amendment of section 7 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1960. It relates to the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor on holiday camps licensed under the Tourist Traffic Act 1952. Amendment No. 4 provides for the amendment of sections 11(5) and 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962. The amendment of section 11(5) removes the prohibition on the granting of an occasional licence on a Good Friday. As Senators will be aware, an occasional licence, subject to obtaining an order from the District Court, allows the holder of an ordinary publican seven-day on-licence to sell intoxicating liquor for a special event at a place to which no licence is currently attached.  Amendment No. 5 provides for the amendment of section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 that will remove the restriction on the sale of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday in premises operating on the basis of a special restaurant licence. It is my view that it would be inequitable to permit the sale of intoxicating liquor in public houses that happen to operate as restaurants or otherwise provide meals to customers but not in restaurants that operate on the basis of a special restaurant licence, of which up to April of this year we have recorded up to 500 such premises. Finally, amendment No. 6 amends the Long Title of the Bill to insert the correct collective citation. I have outlined my amendments and look forward to hearing the views of Senators on same.

He has had a long day today and yesterday by the looks of things. I, too, accept all of the amendments that have been tabled by the Government. I thank the Government for taking the courageous step to support this Bill. Some people have contacted me claiming that the passing of this legislation today would be a black day for Ireland. I contend that today is a great day for Ireland and it is wonderful that the Government has accepted the Bill. The legislation will have brought Ireland into the 21st century and catered for one of our largest industries - the tourism industry.  Incidentally, the Bill, as proposed by my colleague, Senator Lawless, is not a Bill that forces people to take drink on a Good Friday but merely leaves the option open. We are not trying to trample all over the religious beliefs of people in Ireland. The people who have religious beliefs will continue to observe them. The people who wish to have a drink will do so. I sincerely hope that on Good Friday in 2018, I will have a pint with my good colleague, Senator Lawless, in a hostelry somewhere close. I thank the Minister for his time.

Senator Ó Ríordáin spoke on behalf of the Labour Party on Second Stage in support of the legislation. I think the legislation is a sensible move towards the consolidated intoxicating liquor code that the Minister mentioned. We are all hopeful that we will get the code some day. I know many legal practitioners who have made a great living from the complexity of the code and interpreting it for clients. All of us are conscious of the harm caused by alcohol in society. We are also aware of the need for a mature attitude towards alcohol and responsible consumption. The current law has anomalous exceptions about which Senator Ó Ríordáin quite amusingly spoke on Second Stage. As the current law is simply not fit for purpose, it makes sense to introduce this rational change. I am delighted to support the change and the amendments too. 
#FrancesBlack	unknown-#FrancesBlack-party	unknown-#FrancesBlack-dob	unknown-#FrancesBlack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	103	I, too, welcome what the Minister has said. Some people might be surprised that I support the legislation bearing in mind my background of community work and helping people who have problems with alcohol, in particular family members. I am in favour of the change because I believe it will help reduce the harm that alcohol does to the health of our people, which is interesting enough. In recent years, Holy Thursday has been the day on which people become frenzied as though alcohol was about to be prohibited. The excessive amounts of alcohol that are bought because the pubs are closed on Good Friday is a sad reflection on our society. Alcohol is then consumed in homes in the presence of young children. I am really concerned about the unhealthy example that gives children. Members are all familiar with the recently-published report by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon in which he cited the impact alcohol misuse has on children. In addition, bar workers look forward to not working on a Good Friday and being able to spend time with their families. Any changes made to the licensing laws must ensure that one can opt to work on a Good Friday and workers are paid the same rate as that which applies to a bank holiday. The idea of a pub being a regulated environment should make it easy for the responsible server of alcohol to be built in as a requirement in licensing law in Ireland. Many people drink at home before they go out to socialise, which means many licensed premises serve alcohol to people who already are intoxicated. The important issue is not whether the pubs are allowed open on Good Friday but our unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I hope it is okay to say a little bit about this matter. This matter is being addressed by the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. There is a genuine disbelief around the country that public representatives do not favour a Bill that will save lives. The lobbying by the retail and alcohol industries must not be allowed to shape Government policy. The aims of the alcohol industry to maximise consumption and the aims of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill to save lives are incompatible.The saving of even one life is much more important than the profits of multinational corporations. Three people die every day in Ireland from an alcohol-related illness and this must be tackled. I am encouraged by the fact that both An Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar and the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Micheál Martin have both been Ministers for Health and must know that alcohol is a psychoactive drug and should be treated as such. I hope they will put the health of the nation before the wealth of the alcohol industry. The fact that alcohol is legal does not reduce the harm it does and we have an obligation to ensure that Ireland is not defined by our consumption of this drug. I hope we will arrive at a time when the idea of the pubs being open or closed on Good Friday will be irrelevant.

He comes very well equipped to that role and has vast experience in that area. I also pay credit to his former role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his work in Northern Ireland trying to re-establish the power-sharing Executive there. I hope that comes to fruition sooner rather than later. It is inconceivable that they will not realise the necessity of power-sharing as they face into the Brexit situation. In respect of this Bill, it is welcome that the Government will adopt it. Although Senator Lawless has brought in the Bill, he accepts it will go through faster when Government, Opposition and Independent Members work together. It is timely. This Bill was introduced before by former Senator Imelda Henry, who is in the Gallery today and worked very hard on it. We disagreed on it at the time. I adopted a stance similar to that of Senator O'Reilly at that stage. However, like on the road to Damascus, we changed our opinion. It was impractical, particularly in respect of Dublin. Incidentally, these provisions do not force anybody to open on Good Friday. If conscientious objectors have any problem, they do not need to open. It is a matter for themselves, which is reasonable. I am also aware that Padraig Cribben and the Vintners Federation of Ireland are working on this. Frankly, the Bill is quite irrelevant because a number of pubs will not be open next year to avail of its provisions. A lot of rural pubs will be gone. The Government, Government Members of independent stature and others can publish statements about naming and shaming and all that stuff. It is all going to damage rural Ireland and rural pubs. How nice this is. This is just trimmings. One day will not make any difference to the life and soul of rural pubs. We are witnessing the beginning of the end of rural pubs in Ireland. Unfortunately, the Government and Sinn Féin supporters will be collaborating in this regard. That is fine. That is the way they want to go. It will be a sad day for rural Ireland when the reality hits home. It will be too late to reverse the situation then. The laws are there and are being enforced. They are effective and they are getting results. I think people realise that. There is no way I will in any way endorse anyone drinking alcohol. That is not a question of fact.

On a serious note, I am delighted for Senator Lawless. It is not everyone who can say they successfully got a Private Members' Bill over the line. I did need persuasion on the necessity to have pubs open on Good Friday. There are 365 days in the year and they are only closed for two. It is not the biggest crime in the world to leave them closed. I have, however, been persuaded by the arguments, particularly those of Senator Black, given her background, experience and phenomenal work. If she does not have a problem with the Bill, I do not think any of us really can have one. I congratulate Senator Lawless. The Government amendments are primarily technical to ensure that equity flows across all the beer pipes, as it were, in the pubs throughout the country. We have seen a remarkable growth in the brewing and craft beer industry. In County Clare, we have the craft brewers' festival in Doolin, which is one of the most successful festivals in the county. It was created because of the number of cottage breweries that exist in the country. There is proposed legislation to improve brewing. The Minister might like to inform the House as to when he intends to bring that legislation forward. I have also noted media commentary over the weekend that the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, has proposals to protect rural pubs. It is a big challenge. In lots of villages, pubs are now only really open at weekends. There is no way they can make a viable living out of it. Many publicans must now find day jobs and so forth. We need some thinking outside the box in terms of protecting what is part of the fabric of rural society. We often talk about the importance of the post offices. The pubs have a critical role to play as well, particularly for people who live alone. We need some creative thinking in that regard. I am in the presence of some very successful publicans. Senator Leyden owns the Dáil Bar in County Roscommon and Senator Byrne is a very successful publican from a line of many generations in Limerick. There is a lot of service to the hospitality industry in this House. I welcome the thinking outside the box it is hoped the Government will do. A lot of people are worried, particularly about the proposed legislation on drinking and driving and so forth. The pubs have an important role to play in society. I commend Deputy Lawless on his Bill.

We support this Bill. In a previous life as Lord Mayor of Belfast, I was a vocal champion for renewing, reviewing and ultimately changing our licensing laws and how they operate in the North. It would be hypocritical of me if I did not champion the same in this institution. The reason I champion it, as Members have alluded to in terms of previous contributions, is because of the potential economic benefit for our tourism sector, the importance of that to the economy of the State and what it does for job creation, provision of services and so on. I have some issues with the broader sentiment of the Bill. While I support Senator Lawless, and he knows he has our party's support, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to outline some of the issues, not so much in the Bill because it is very direct in what it sets out to achieve, but in the broader context of the issue of our relationship with alcohol in Ireland. Senator Black referred to that during the course of her contribution. Senator Leyden accused us of being in cahoots with Fine Gael. I do not understand why this Bill could be brought forward and yet the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is gathering dust on a shelf somewhere. Support for this legislation today does not mean we should not have the opportunity to debate the real concerns about Ireland's relationship with alcohol, its impact on the cohesion of our society, and the tangible practical issues it brings to bear on our health care system and other aspects of life, including the financial and many other burdens. Another issue I touched on in the Second Stage debate is workers' rights. I appreciate fully that it is a separate matter in terms of what this Bill sets out to achieve, but it would be remiss of us when we are debating this issue not to reflect the experience of workers in the hospitality sector. Currently, the trade is dominated by minimum wage pay, no overtime rates, no pension and no sick pay. There are no guaranteed hours of work. The bar and hospitality trade have become a template for the low wage exploitation economy that has taken hold of large sections of our economy. Research by the Nevin Economic Research Institute reveals that 345,000 workers, equal to 25% of the workforce, earn an hourly rate below the living wage of €11.50 per hour. While I do not believe that is a negative in terms of what the Bill can do, I am sure the Minister will accept that in its broadest possible sense it puts an onus on us to reflect on the people who work in our bars and the hospitality sector generally who are already under a huge amount of pressure. If Senator Lawless has achieved more than one objective with the passage of this Bill, his focus remains on the people who work in the sector. As a society, we need to reflect on our relationship with alcohol. I welcome the Bill. It is the right decision. It is stand-alone legislation in that regard. If done properly and if all the issues I have outlined are dealt with in a truly national conversation, this is welcome and very important legislation.

I echo the comments of other Members who lamented the stalling of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and referred to the powerful lobby that seeks to dilute it. I hope Fianna Fáil will take note of that. This issue should be a priority. The countless reports of hidden harm and the effects of alcohol on our children and on families are available for all to read.

In the late 1980s, when Ian Paisley finally had to give in to pubs opening on Sundays, there were protests about that. I do not believe there will be protests about this Bill in this part of the country. I refer to the harm alcohol can cause. Home drinking has increased massively. I have memories of being a young adult when, for the first time ever one Christmas, my mother decided to buy a bottle of wine.

To assuage her religious belief, she dutifully introduced Blue Nun to the seven of us. We thought that was astounding at the time but when one looks back one realises it was a naive time. I thank Senator Lawless. I hope we will all enjoy sensible drinking and that this measure will allow us come into the 21st century in that regard.

He made the point that a publican had the freedom to opt out of this in the sense that an individual publican might not necessarily open. That is fair enough to a point, but there will be pressure and a commercial imperative on publicans. What is happening up the street can become a difficulty and they could tend to lose customers, so it is putting them in an unfair position. I understood we would have a proper Report Stage. I have a few difficulties with this legislation. That we are starting to try to deal with the alcohol question is at variance with health policy in general. That sends the wrong subliminal message and it is a mistake in that respect. I genuinely believe it offends many, although not all, people from all the Christian traditions in this country who have dearly held religious beliefs around the fact there are two sacred days in the calendar, Christmas Day and Good Friday. It offends the sensibilities of a number of people in this regard. I genuinely believe those people's sensibilities, sensitivities and feelings in this matter and their rights of citizenship should not be ignored or cavalierly regarded. I regret that. I have an amount of anecdotal evidence to support it. I would be concerned about the issue of workers' rights, which has been well articulated by colleagues. Traditionally, Good Friday was a day off for the people who worked in the bar sector. I hope they will receive adequate remuneration. Some of them may have personal difficulty with this measure. Traditionally, it was a day of rest. Those two big days marked the Christian calendar. They were part of our Christian tradition in Ireland. There is a mythology that in some way this measure will assist tourism.What assists tourism in Ireland is our distinctiveness, our native culture, our difference, our Christian values and our traditions. Maintaining our identity attracts far more people to the country than shredding that identity on the altar of naked commercialism and constantly seeking to fumble in the greasy till and add the ha'pence to the pence. Senator Leyden is right in saying that the rural pub is under threat. It is an endangered species which offers its own problems in rural areas. It has its own difficulties in terms of the tourism sector and the quality of life of people who live in isolation. While he is right about that, opening on two further days a year is not the way to resolve the matter. From talking to them, I know that the great majority of rural publicans do not want to open on Good Friday. They would prefer the status quo. This is putting them under further economic pressure with costs. It was a day on which their premises were closed and on which they carried out repairs or whatever. Now they will be under commercial pressure from their peers and their neighbours to open and put in staff for a day, which, in most instances, will not yield a return. I think more reflection is required in respect of the Bill; we are rushing into it too much. We need to stand back a little. It is too easy to jump on every fad. With regard to the Minister in some way improving on our position, I think people want us to keep our tradition and culture, and stand up for what is right. Many people outside the House have genuine and sincerely held religious views on Good Friday, which is very sacred to them. I am not sure that we should not respect it a bit more.

I also pay tribute to our colleague and former Senator, Imelda Henry, who prepared this legislation in the previous Seanad. I welcome the members of the LVA and Dublin vintners today. While I understand Senator O'Reilly's point of view, a report published yesterday on the agrifood sector by Ciaran Fitzgerald, an economist, showed that tourists spend €6.5 billion in this country annually and 65% of that is outside Dublin, including in rural regions, where it is the largest and, in some cases, only economic activity. While I understand the religious aspect, I have seen tourists in Limerick city looking to get food on Good Friday. Places have not been open and it has been very inconvenient for them. Therefore, the legislation we are passing is most welcome. It is about choice. Nobody is saying that people have to go out and drink on Good Friday. When sports clubs and the different organisations that were able to serve drink on Good Friday were open, people had a choice; they either went to them or they did not. I also support what Senator Black said about the amount of binge drinking that was happening. People were going out and bulk-buying drink from supermarkets on Thursday, which was also anti-publican. However, this is about giving people choice and facilitating tourists. I welcome the Bill's passage.

I wish him well with his new portfolio. I also welcome the former Senator, Imelda Henry, and her colleagues in the Gallery. In particular, I commend Senator Lawless and his colleagues who co-sponsored the legislation. I welcome the passage of the Bill. While I understand Senator O'Reilly's reservations, I am of the view that it is in the best interest of health and controlling the abuse of alcohol. We all know what happens at Easter and Christmas. There is a big stock-up of alcohol in private houses because the pubs are closed on Good Friday. Far more alcohol is consumed - in fact, dangerous levels are consumed - because the licensed premises are closed. I also contend that pubs being closed drives more people to drink on Good Friday than would do so if they were open. Senator Ó Donnghaile mentioned the licensing laws in Northern Ireland. For as long as I can remember, droves of people have travelled to the Border towns in the North in order to take a drink on Good Friday. The only reason for doing so was that the pubs in the Republic were closed. While they might not necessarily have been going for a drink at all, it was something they could not do in the Republic on that particular day.

It is ludicrous that at the beginning of the tourist season and heading into the height of it, tourists cannot have a drink in public houses here. That has been wrong. While bearing in mind what Senator O'Reilly said about tradition and religious offence, quite frankly, other legislation passed in this House and in the Lower House has offended people of religious thinking far more than this legislation will do. I commend the legislation to the House and I hope it also goes through the Dáil. If people want more time to think about it, they can consult with their colleagues in the Lower House and propose amendments that Deputies could take on board. I welcome the passage of the legislation.

I am happy to welcome the passage of the Bill on behalf of the Labour group. I commend Senator Lawless on his great work in getting it through. For all the reasons I and others have given, it is important that we see it through. I hope it goes to the Dáil. We live in a republic and it is an important step in the development of a more mature attitude to alcohol consumption and also in the separation of church and State. The points about harm done by alcohol are well made as are the points about workers' rights. However, those are not irreconcilable with the merit of the Bill. I thank the Minister and his officials for accepting the Bill. It is good to see a Private Members' Bill, introduced by a Member of the Opposition, pass through the Seanad. We have had a number of these and this is another success for the Seanad.

It was not a particularly successful meeting but I had not expected it to be. They mentioned to me that this Good Friday Bill was offered to them as part of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. While I am speaking from memory, I believe the vintners explained to me that they clearly rejected that because they did not believe the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill would ever see the light of day again. My one regret is that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was not passed before this legislation. I must be clear on this; that is Fine Gael's fault. Fine Gael Senators have objected and blocked their own Bill, which is shameful. I am encouraged by the Taoiseach's comments yesterday, but it is beholden on all of us to ensure that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which is a Fine Gael Bill and not a Sinn Féin Bill, is actually passed as it is and not made toothless. If that does not happen, shame on all of us.

I wanted to add my voice. I will try not to repeat what others have said. I welcome the Bill. I congratulate Senator Lawless on his tireless work. I also congratulate the former Senator, Imelda Henry, on the work she did on this matter in the previous Seanad.One topic mentioned by those a little uncomfortable about the Bill is respect for traditions and values. As a person from a minority background, the most important value is that the State is a republic, that all those in the State are tolerated equally and that the value system of the majority is not imposed as much as was previously the case. That is an issue on which the country is slowly progressing and the Bill is yet another example of how we are starting to open up. If people choose not to take alcohol on Good Friday - as I will so choose due to the peculiar nature of my personality rather than any religious views - that is fine. However, legislation prohibiting the consumption of alcohol on Good Friday is no longer needed and Ireland needs to move more quickly towards being a secular and open republic. I commend the Bill.

I was very happy to co-sign it. He put an enormous amount of work into it from beginning to end. It has not had an easy passage. Many people had to be convinced and many changed their minds along the way. It must be acknowledged that it was not a walkover. Senator Lawless had to consult and convince people. He had to argue and set out the rationale and logic behind the legislation. He did that exceptionally well, as is the case with anything to which he applies himself. I acknowledge that because it was not all simple. At the beginning of the process, it was not certain that this Stage would be reached. I acknowledge the consultations, work and focus that went into the Bill and the constant need for Senator Lawless to keep bringing the matter up and on the political agenda, which he might not say himself but many Members know to what I refer. I acknowledge and thank the Minister for facilitating the legislation as it would not have come to fruition without his input. He is new to his very important role and has contributed to making the Bill a success. Perhaps this is an example of new politics and it is a good example thereof. We have arrived at a common-sense position and the right legislation. Members will look back on the Bill and wonder why it was not passed a long time ago. I particularly acknowledge the work and commitment of Senator Lawless.

I compliment him on his contribution in the House to date. Like many other Senators, he is new to the House but he is leaving his mark and the Bill is one example of that. When the prohibition was first introduced, the concept of drinking alcohol at home was a non-entity because no-one ever did that. Unfortunately, in today's world more and more people are drinking at home. That is not a good thing. I encourage people who want to have a drink to go to a public house to do so because when one is at home - and I take the odd tipple myself at home - the temptation is to open the bottle and not pay much attention to the measures one is consuming. When one is in a pub, measures are calculated and one knows how much alcohol one is getting. The ship has sailed a long time ago on the issue addressed by the Bill. It is sensible legislation that I fully support. I compliment Senator Lawless again on bringing it forward.

I also thank the Leader, Senator Buttimer, for honouring his commitment and ensuring that Committee and Final Stages of the Bill are being taken today. I also thank the co-sponsors of the Bill, Senators McDowell, Craughwell and Boyhan, along with James Geoghegan, who helped me with the Bill. I commend my great friend, former Senator Imelda Henry. Her father is also a great friend of mine. I acknowledge the work she put into the Bill and thank her for it. It provided a basis for me to build upon. I thank the former Minister for Justice and Equality and current Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Fitzgerald, who advocated the change put forward in the Bill to the Government. I am delighted to have the support of the Government in bringing the Bill through the Seanad. I thank the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for ensuring that amendments were submitted in time to make certain that, along with pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises will be able to open on Good Friday once the Bill has been passed by the Dáil and signed by the President. The passage of the Bill is another progressive step in Ireland's long journey towards separation between church and State. It is understandable that when lawmakers try to introduce legislation to change a practice that has been in place for almost 100 years, people pause to reflect upon that. However, that is what legislating is supposed to do and it is what I came to this House to effect. There is an affinity to the day of closure but in many cases it is leading to alcohol abuse. Government policy is to reduce binge drinking, which is an objective with which no Member would disagree. Cheap, low-cost alcohol needs to be removed from supermarkets and off-licences. Under existing legislation, an 18-year-old with €10 could buy 10 cans of beer on Holy Thursday to keep for the next day but could not meet friends in a pub on that day to drink two to three pints costing the same amount of money. Removing this 90-year-old provision from the Statute Book sends another clear message that Ireland is a pluralist, global and forward-thinking country. The passage of the Bill also says something about the Upper House, which survived an attempt to abolish it in 2013.

I wanted to step out of the Chair to make comments I would not otherwise have been able to make. Almost all issues have been addressed but I particularly congratulate and thank Senator Lawless for putting the legislation forward, along with his co-sponsors, Senators Boyhan, Craughwell and McDowell. I also thank my party, Fianna Fáil, for supporting the legislation. It had to consider and deliberate on the Bill. I thank the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, his Front Bench team and other party members for their support. When I was elected to the Seanad, I told the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, which represents Dublin publicans and was good enough, along with another body, to nominate me for the Seanad, that I would do my best to have this issue addressed but, as a new Senator, I was unsure of what the outcome would be. I am delighted that, a year after being elected to the Seanad, the Bill is progressing through the House. Pubs are the lifeblood of communities in both rural and urban areas across the country and are also very important to tourism. The number of visitors from the UK, which is our biggest market, has dropped significantly this year. Anything that detracts from Ireland's attractiveness to that market is not a good thing. In recent years, many pubs in Dublin have opened on Good Friday to serve food and soft drinks. They will now also be able to serve alcohol. I thank former Senator Imelda Henry and welcome her to the House, along with the chief executives of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, and the LVA. They have also done great work on this issue and many others. To hear Members such as Senator Frances Black supporting the Bill gives one confidence it will result in less alcohol being consumed on Good Friday than was previously the case because there is much anecdotal evidence of off-licence operators saying Holy Thursday is their busiest day of the year. An off-licence not far from my house ran out of beer on a Holy Thursday several years ago. This is a very significant day. The Minister might outline how soon the Bill might pass through the Dáil, although I acknowledge that is a matter for the Business Committee. Senators want the Bill enacted long before Christmas if possible in order that there be no likelihood that it will not be in force by Good Friday 2018. In reference to a point raised by Senator Gavan, both publican representative organisations support the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and have no difficulty with it. They may have felt that it was being frustrated and that if their piece of legislation went into it, it might never see the light of day but they are not against the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.

A number of issues were raised by Seanadóirí in the course of the debate. It is not my intention to address them because we will have a further opportunity to do so. However, in response to Senators' concerns about the Sale of Alcohol Bill, to which reference was made, I wish to state that it is not gathering dust on any shelf anywhere. It will proceed in the next session. I acknowledge what the Taoiseach has said on that in recent times. I also acknowledge, however, that there is further work to be done and that it is unlikely to be enacted in its current form. Like all legislation, it will be subject to rigorous, robust and full debate in the Dáil and also in this House. That is precisely the manner and means by which and through which legislation is enacted. A number of Senators made reference to workers' rights. It was appropriate that they should do so. I want to acknowledge what this Government has done in that regard, particularly in response to the recently published report of the Low Pay Commission. Workers' rights and workers' pay will continue to be a priority for this Government. I acknowledge again the second increase in the minimum wage. The second increase in the lifetime of this Government has now been agreed and will come into force on 1 January 2018 in the form of an increase of 30 cent per hour. It is modest but it keeps well ahead of inflation and it also underscores commitment on the part of this Government to its objective to ensure that every family will benefit from an economy that continues to grow and from economic progress in recent years that was hard won. During the summer months, when the Seanad goes into recess, the Government will engage at the highest level in respect of the Estimates for departmental spending and the budget that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, looks forward to introducing in the autumn. We will continue to acknowledge the need for wider and broader support for lower-paid workers to achieve the objective of opportunities for all. I wish to commend the initiative of Senator Billy Lawless, an Independent, with the support of other parties in this House. I commend Seanadóirí and acknowledge the cross-party support. I also acknowledge the contribution of Members of the previous Seanad to the genesis of this legislation. In that regard, I acknowledge the work done by and initiative shown in respect of this matter by my colleague and friend and former Senator, Imelda Henry. I am pleased to see her present for the enactment here in the Seanad of legislation that she was particularly interested in during the course of her career. Senator Martin Conway is not here. He made reference to the Intoxicating Liquor (Breweries and Distilleries) Bill. It is a Private Members' Bill in the Dáil, which, like the Bill before the House, was not opposed by Government. The Government is currently working on Committee Stage amendments. I will say, for the benefit of those in this House and beyond who are interested, that there will be restrictions in that legislation. The hours of trade will be restricted to 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and the sale of alcohol in these craft brewery premises will be restricted to those who have participated in tours of the premises. I also understand that consumption on or off a premises would only be applicable to a product that is either brewed or distilled on that premises. This is a Bill that would require a measure of work. However, that is work which we will, I hope, be in a position - by way of the cross-party co-operation and support that facilitated Senator Lawless' Bill - to be able to complete by the end of the year in both Houses. I acknowledge that there is work to be done on that legislation. I acknowledge the role of Senator Billy Lawless in respect of the Bill before the House, which is important in the context of ensuring that all our legislation is of a type, form and measure that is befitting of a pluralist republic. This legislation is very much in keeping with that objective.

I do not intend to prolong the debate on these amendments, which we flagged when we articulated the case for them during yesterday's Second Stage debate. The rationale for amendment No. 1 is to ensure allegations of domestic violence are removed completely from the Bill. We appreciate that section 3 of the Bill provides that it shall not apply to "proceedings under the Domestic Violence Acts". As the Minister is aware, concerns about this legislation have been raised by Women's Aid. Many women who are in the process of separating from an abusive partner are involved in other family law proceedings such as separation, divorce and child custody, access or maintenance. There does not seem to be a process for ensuring such cases are screened out of the provisions of this Bill. Equally, there is no scope to include such proceedings under the Domestic Violence Bill 2017, which is making its way through the Oireachtas. In its 2010 report on alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, the Law Reform Commission acknowledged that family law disputes which are not suitable for mediation include those covered by the Domestic Violence Acts and those in which the safety of one of the parties or the children involved, or both, is at risk. It recommended that both types of case should be exempted from mandatory information sessions on mediation. The report states:Therefore, the Commission recommends a party to a family law proceeding would not be required to attend an information session under the following circumstances:- Where the proceedings involve an application for a safety order, a barring order or a protection order under the Domestic Violence Act 1996; or- Where a party satisfies the court that his or her personal safety, or the safety of his or her children is or are at risk.A similar approach would better protect someone who is separating from an abusive partner from unintended negative consequences of mediation. Therefore, the list of proceedings to which the Bill does not apply should be expanded to include family law cases where domestic violence is alleged. We note that amendments based on this recommendation were not accepted in the Dáil on the basis that mediation remains voluntary and that similar obligations on solicitors to advise mediation in family law already exist in other relevant Acts. This misses the point that it may be difficult for a woman to refuse mediation when it is so strongly encouraged by the legal system, even if it is not safe. I refer to some much more concerning provisions of this Bill, in sections 16 and 21, which may be highly detrimental to victims of domestic violence who are engaged in family law proceedings. These provisions would allow a perpetrator of domestic violence to apply for the court to invite parties to mediation. Under section 21, refusal to consider or attend mediation can be considered when costs are being awarded. This means that a victim of domestic violence may be "invited" to mediation by her abuser, who may use this tactic to protract proceedings. I am concerned that this legislation might lead to a woman being coerced to agree to mediation, even if it is not safe for her or in her best interests. She may well fear that if she does not engage, she will have to pay the costs. Our amendment is pretty direct and straightforward in what it sets out to do. I appreciate that we laid our case before the Minister and our colleagues in the Seanad yesterday. Given the severity of this problem, and in light of the calls that have been made by survivors of domestic abuse and by reputable organisations like Women's Aid Ireland, we felt it was important to table this considered and nuanced amendment to the Bill, which seeks to safeguard the victims and survivors of domestic abuse and to allow for greater access to the judicial and legal system. It is hoped it will ultimately allow for greater passage through that system in order that these people feel protected and safeguarded and are not forced into situations which would be detrimental to them.

Senator Ó Donnghaile has touched on why this is so important. I will focus on amendment No. 4, which proposes that mediators should receive training in awareness of domestic violence. It is vital for those who are going to be working with people who end up within the courts system to receive this important training. When two parties are in a room trying to find some reconciliation, the mediator holds the balance of power. We can never really understand the balance of power that exists between those two parties outside that room. That is why we need to ensure people are trained to understand domestic violence, which is not always clear-cut and obvious. It is sometimes difficult to realise that for reasons of manipulation, coercion and risk to personal safety, one party in the room is under the complete power of the other party. Training is vital. Our request for training in this arena to be provided is a modest one. Domestic violence is part of many homes. I support these amendments. I emphasise the importance of training in this area.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	165	I acknowledge the points made by Senators Ruane and Ó Donnghaile during the debate we had on this matter yesterday. I understand and appreciate their intentions in raising the important issues of domestic violence and personal safety in challenging and difficult circumstances. I regret that I am unable to accept these amendments for reasons I will now explain. I will make two clear points at the outset. I want to underline again that section 3(1)(h) of the Bill, which makes specific reference to "proceedings under the Domestic Violence Acts 1996 to 2011", is a specific, important, intended and deliberate exclusion. It is important to reiterate a point I made a number of times yesterday. I am sure all Senators will accept that mediation is and will remain a voluntary process. This is made clear in the definition in section 2 of the Bill. While the role of a mediator is to help parties to resolve their dispute, it is really a matter for the parties themselves to decide whether to engage in the process of mediation. Amendment No. 1 seeks to amend section 3 to exclude "proceedings where there are allegations of domestic violence or assault between the relevant parties" or "proceedings where the safety of one of the parties (and/or their children) is at risk". I must make it perfectly clear that the Mediation Bill 2017 is exclusively concerned with disputes that may result in civil proceedings. As the Bill relates to civil proceedings only, it does not really have a role or function in criminal proceedings. Therefore, mediation would not have any role to play in cases of assault or other criminal activity. In such cases, the advice would be to report the matter to the Garda in order that the appropriate gathering of evidence can take place and a prosecution can take place under our criminal code and criminal laws. I will set out the position in respect of family law proceedings where domestic abuse is alleged or the safety of any party or child is an issue.Again, I refer to the Dáil debate where the Bill was amended to ensure coherence and consistency between its provisions and those of other family law-related legislation, particularly the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996. Sections 5 and 6 of the 1989 Act require solicitors acting for both the applicants and the respondents in a judicial separation case to discuss the options of mediation with their respective clients and to provide them with names, addresses and details of persons and organisations qualified to provide mediation services. I refer Senators to sections 6 and 7 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996, which impose the same obligations on solicitors acting for parties in divorce cases. Discussing mediation options is a duty. Neither of these Acts specifically excludes solicitors' mediation-related obligations in cases in which domestic abuse is alleged or indeed in cases where safety issues are put forward by a party. There are no such exclusions in the 1989 Act and the 1995 Act because mediation is a voluntary process and that will remain very much the core of the engagement under this legislation. A party who has experienced domestic abuse, and I say this to Senators Ruane and Ó Donnghaile who make their points very sincerely, is really unlikely to enter into any form of mediation unless he or she is doing so to protect children from the ordeal of court proceedings. My difficulty is that the amendments would not alter the existing obligations on solicitors to discuss mediation options with parties in cases where domestic abuse is alleged. That would require amendments to the 1989 and 1996 Acts but not in this Bill. If one recalls yesterday's debate, we underlined the point that mediation offers a less stressful, less adversarial, less difficult and often speedier alternative to court proceedings in family law cases, particularly where children are involved and where the legacy of bitterness, hostility and problems that often result from long-drawn-out court proceedings are avoided. I am unable to accept the amendments for the reasons I stated.  Amendment No. 3 proposes to amend section 8 by requiring the mediator to inquire separately of the parties whether there has been domestic abuse in the relationship and to take a view on whether mediation is appropriate. If we were to require or charge the mediator to engage in the type of activity the amendment proposes, we would be extending the role and function of the mediator in a way that could be described as intrusive and could cause practical difficulties. It would run against it being a matter for the parties to decide whether to seek a resolution of their own dispute through mediation. Amendment No. 3 would impose a general obligation on mediators, not having regard to the type of dispute involved. While the intention would be that it would only apply in family cases, the manner in which it is drafted means that a mediator would also be required to make such inquiries in other cases, for example, commercial cases or disputes between neighbours concerning a hedge, boundary or overhanging tree. For this reason, I am unable to accept amendment No. 3. Are we discussing amendment No. 4 now?

I would prefer to see that in a code of practice for actual mediators and not for those who seek to become mediators. While I envisage a role for training standards, I do not envisage it being provided under this section. I draw attention to paragraph 1(b) of the Schedule, which provides that the functions of the Mediation Council will include reference to developing standards and a system of continuing professional development training. Training in domestic violence awareness is more appropriate to developing standards in the provision of mediation services by the council rather than in the code of practice under section 9. I note that codes of practice for mediators in other jurisdictions do not include the provision for such training. I have sympathy with what the Senators wish to impose by way of these amendments and I regret it is not possible to accept them in the form proposed.

I take the Minister at his word that he accepts the sincerity with which the amendments have been made by Senator Ruane and me and others. I should probably have referred more specifically to amendments Nos. 3 and 4 given that we are taking them together. As we discussed the spirit of them yesterday, I appreciate the Minister's response in acknowledging all of that. I will push these amendments to a vote because as the Minister rightly acknowledged, we are coming at this from a sincere point of view and think there is merit in it. At the heart of this is a victim-centred approach - a human rights-centred approach. I have made the points. The amendments speak for themselves. It would have been remiss of me, my Sinn Féin colleagues and other colleagues had we not articulated the real human experience and concerns that drove the intention behind these amendments. I believe it would have added to this Bill and would have gone some way towards assisting survivors of domestic abuse who find themselves in this situation. Senator Ruane spoke very passionately and eloquently about that yesterday and I have no doubt she will do the same today. I thank the Minister but on this point, we must agree to disagree.

The Minister stated it would almost be intrusive to ask whether domestic violence exists. I would much prefer a solicitor being intrusive than ending up in a situation that would harm me or my children. Consequently, I would choose someone being intrusive any day. The Minister also said he could not imagine somebody entering into mediation if they had ever experienced domestic violence. This is completely untrue. Experience tells me that it is untrue. People enter their homes at night when they experience domestic violence. They live in homes with people who abuse and batter them. They go to family gatherings where abusers are to be found. They sometimes have to work in the same building as their abusers and to assume a person would not enter a mediation room because their abuser is in the room with him or her is a completely false idea.I have supported many women, especially in the family law courts. I will not be able to use them as examples because I have to protect their identity, but one of them, who is no longer with us having passed away several years ago, went into mediation with not only her abuser but somebody who solicited her to feed his drug habit and who subsequently warned her that if she did not enter the mediation room he would lie about her ability to look after her child and that he would then take her through the courts to get custody of that child. He kept that threat hanging over her in a mediation room in order that she would agree to access and certain maintenance. People will enter a room with their abuser. They do it every day. That is a completely false way to look at this.

This Bill has been carefully drafted and he has taken into account all of the issues. I also take on board the concerns of the proposers of the amendments. They are very genuine concerns but the way this matter has been dealt with in the Bill is the appropriate manner. We should not accept the amendments as set out and we should accept the Bill as brought forward by the Minister to this House.

That may already cause a conflict. There is also the deaf community to be considered. We have all been thinking about them recently because we have been debating the Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016. People can only engage in meaningful mediation if they have language support. There is a power balance to consider if English is the first language of only one of two parents who are separating. It is important that there is somebody there who can support the other party and keep the balance of power between them. The amendment is obvious. I do not feel that anyone is listening.

We support the amendment for the reasons outlined by Senator Ruane. We would also like to take the opportunity to outline our concerns regarding interpretation services and the legal system as it stands in a broad sense. It is astonishing that in this day and age there is no regulation of the standards of interpretation. Court and legal interpretation is a highly specialised area that needs a significant level of training, as the Minister will appreciate. All that appears to be required for interpreters now is that they speak English and the language they are translating.  Senator Ruane mentioned sign language and all the issues of extreme marginalisation the deaf community face. This would be another example of that and one we could help resolve by accepting this amendment.

If we are proposing mediation as an alternative to legal process, it is important that it does not serve as a disadvantage or that it does not imply a lower standard of equality before the law or within a process. There are wider concerns such as our international protection Acts and the question of documents translated through services such as Google Translate. There is concern about the lack of accountability and standards in respect of interpretation and translation of necessary documents. This is a relevant amendment and I encourage the Minister to accept it. If he is not going to accept it can he indicate how he plans to address this concern and ensure that it is addressed in mediation?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	175	Amendment No. 2 proposes to amend section 6(4) by inserting a provision whereby a party may request interpretation services where a language barrier exists. I would draw the House's attention and that of the Seanadóirí who have tabled this amendment to section 6(4)(b) of the Bill which provides that a party may: "(b) be accompanied to the mediation, and assisted by, a person (including a legal advisor) who is not a party". I believe that section 6(4)(b) covers a situation where a party requires translation services. My Department has been informed by the Mediators Institute of Ireland, MII, that the presence of an interpreter during mediation is already a relatively frequent occurrence. I do not see the need for the amendment. Amendment No. 5 proposes to insert into section 9, which deals with codes of practice, a provision relating specifically to the issue of Irish language proficiency standards for mediators. I accept the point made about our native tongue but I believe that a code of practice for mediators is not the correct place to deal with training standards or language proficiency and, therefore, I cannot accept it. Developing standards in the provision of mediation services will be a matter for the mediation council following its establishment.  Amendment No. 9 seeks to insert in the Schedule to the Bill a further function for the proposed mediation council, that is, the establishment and maintenance of a register of mediators who are able to provide mediation services in the Irish language. I do not believe that requiring the council to establish two separate registers is necessary or desirable. It could lead to confusion for clients looking for a mediator.  There is an obligation on the mediator to furnish the parties with information regarding his or her qualifications, experience, training and continuing professional development under 8(1)(b) of the Bill. The Mediators' Institute of Ireland has confirmed the availability of Irish language services so there should not be significant difficulty in procuring such services should they be required. I do not see the amendment as adding anything to the services which already exist and therefore I do not accept it.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	176	I do not believe the provisions set out in section 6(b) are an adequate solution. Simply saying that people may be accompanied by a party places the obligation to source their own interpreter entirely on them. It privileges those who may have financial resources that are greater than others, so once again, we are introducing inequality into the process. I remind the Minister that this entire Bill is about directing people into mediation services. We are not merely suggesting that we impose standards or regulations on a particular sector out of the blue. This Bill seeks to make sure that people are informed, that solicitors will have to sign affidavits to say that they have told clients about mediation, and have encouraged them into that. If, through this legislation, we direct people towards the mediation process, I believe it is appropriate for us to ensure that the best standards are in place. Every public body and Department has a duty to equality and human rights. It is set out in our equality legislation. There is a positive, public duty to equality and human rights so where there is any concern that an inequality may arise through a legal provision that we are putting forward in law, it is a matter for the Oireachtas and the Minister and his Department. If he cannot address it through the legislation, I suggest he would engage meaningfully with the question of standards and equality and that he suggest what he would do in this area by way of a ministerial order or other guidance or standard setting. It is not acceptable to say that this is an area outside of us, when we are legislating towards it. On being accompanied by a person, it is very important to be clear that a solicitor is not an interpreter. It says "a person". Will an individual have to decide between a solicitor and an interpreter? Will we have to hope that people find solicitors who can speak 20 languages and one of these happens to be their own? Are we leaving ourselves vulnerable to the heartbreaking situation which we heard in this House, particularly with regard to Irish Sign Language, where inappropriate situations can arise such as when children are asked to come in and interpret in disputes between their parents or in situations of violence. Are we asking that people would find their own person and have someone within their community to interpret, denying them privacy? This is a very reasonable provision and I ask that if the Minister cannot accept it as an amendment because he wishes to push this Bill through, that he would at least hear it as a concern and plan to take action in future.

I accept that there is provision within the legal system and sometimes people do not have the opportunity to do that because that sector does not employ people with proficiency in Irish. This is something my colleagues have been examining in the context of the judicial appointments Bill, for instance, so that there would be more members of the Judiciary able to engage through Irish. We believe that if the State is going to direct people to use mediation that they should be sure that it is available in both official languages of the State and that is why we have tabled this amendment.

However, we can make legislation far too prescriptive and it can have the opposite effect to that which was intended. This Bill proposes that there will be a code of practice and a mediation council. The mediation council will have an obligation to ensure that the code of practice has a broad discretionary influence and power, and reflects all the nuances that exist. I do not see the logic in putting the need for mediators who can work through the medium of Irish in the legislation. Of course we have mediators who can work through Irish because it makes sense. If someone is a trained mediator and has fluent Irish, he or she will attract business from those who wish to engage through Irish. There was a case in Galway where a plaque or sculpture had to be removed at enormous cost to Galway County Council because it featured three mistakes in the Irish section. They were only small mistakes, and some people interpreted the text differently and argued that they were not really mistakes at all. We have to be realistic. Putting an amendment such as this in the Bill serves no purpose and achieves nothing. We are far better off ensuring that the mediation council is established and that its code of practice is as detailed as possible, including all the nuances which have arisen in the course of this debate.

I do not see the necessity for Senator Ó Donnghaile's amendment in so far as the proficiency of mediators in the Irish language is concerned. It is a matter that will be dealt with in the context of training and standards under the auspices of the council which is the most appropriate place.I make a similar comment on those who wish to conduct a legal or court case through the Irish language. Such services are freely available. I am not sure to whom Senator Ó Donnghaile is referring when he states that people do not have this opportunity. I do not believe it to be the case. Anybody who wishes to litigate or appear in the courts of the land through the medium of the Irish language is accommodated. I expect the same level of service to be accommodated to people wishing to mediate through the Irish language. I missed Senator Higgins's contribution on Second Stage but I certainly bemoan the aggressive tone of her contribution. This is a Bill on the part of the Government that has cross-party support and is long-awaited and broadly welcomed. There is no intention on the part of the Government or anybody to restrict the avenues through which people might engage in mediation. Nobody is trying to put obstacles in front of anybody. The Senator referred to cost and under the legal aid scheme, as I am sure she is particularly aware, the Legal Aid Board will cover the cost of interpretation or language services when legal aid is provided under the criteria. It is also somewhat disingenuous of the Senator to make the point that the legal adviser would also be the interpreter. I do not know of any instance where that is the case and I do not believe there is such an intention in the law. For the reasons I made clear earlier, I do not intend to accept the amendments.

We speak of cross-party support but we are a group within the Seanad and we are asking questions. It is not a simple matter and we are not here to rubber-stamp proposals. We are here to ask appropriate questions. Nobody suggests obstacles have intentionally been put in place. It was never a suggestion. We simply reminded the Minister and the House that there is a positive public duty - a proactive duty - to ask if we are actively supporting equality in this and actively working to ensure an equality of process. That is what is set out in the founding legislation of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and what public duty means. It means we need to be constantly vigilant to ensure we are actively working to promote an equality of experience and access. I am certainly not saying obstacles are intentionally being put in the way but rather I am concerned as to whether we are giving due consideration to equality matters. It is an important question that should be asked of every piece of legislation and the earlier in the process, the better. There were questions concerning the Legal Aid Board, interpretation and mediation. I did not suggest that people have to go with solicitors who are also interpreters but I asked the question whether we have ensured in this legislation that people do not find themselves in a torn position because it sets out that a person would be brought in. Will the Minister address my specific question? Is he concerned that the phrase is "assisted by a person"? Is there any potential difficulty or tension between someone having to choose between an interpreter and a lawyer? It is a legitimate question that is important to ensure people have the necessary supports going into mediation. I would like that question answered.

The code of practice that will be developed and put in place by the mediation council will ensure an ethical framework will exist to guarantee that type of scenario just will not happen. To a large extent, it is a fantasy world. It will not happen. I had a motion here on mediation in 2013 and we debated the topic for two hours. Back then there was very little mediation and it is great that the Government will now have a statutory framework with this legislation so it will be a requirement for solicitors to recommend mediation and give clients names and addresses of mediators. A mediation council will set a code of practice. I do not see the sense in this amendment.

Only last year somebody from the deaf community had to sit through a court proceeding without an interpreter. I am sure there must be some sort of code of practice around that but it was not adhered to. We have people in hospitals and waiting rooms in doctors' surgeries who should also be adhering to codes of practice but instead there are children delivering diagnoses of breast cancer and all sorts of conditions to parents who either do not have English as a first language or are from the deaf community. Codes of practice are only strengthened by having legislation underpinning the process. It is not a positive to always turn to codes of practice and guidelines and we should underpin everything we do by legislation to make it stronger so somebody must have the right to request interpretation.

We have obligations under human rights laws that interpretation be provided in these circumstances. That is fundamental. That will be the case under this Bill as well. With regard to the number of persons involved, I point out again the long-established code of law under our interpretation Acts in which the singular includes the plural. I do not see the concerns of the Senator being such as she would like them to be. I assure her it is the desire of the Government in introducing this legislation to provide an alternative that is more cost-effective, less adversarial and to the benefit of the public. That is without any intent on the part of the Government to disadvantage people and certainly not to introduce or tolerate any form of unfairness or inequality; the opposite is the case as far as this legislation is concerned. It is a theme right through the Bill.

There was some mention earlier that we had implied the Government would be putting obstacles in the way. That is not what we are trying to do; we are trying to identify the obstacles and are asking the Government to work with us to remove them. We are not saying the Government is putting those obstacles in place. They are two very different things. Amendments Nos. 6 to 8 are underpinned by the same principle and spirit. I have decided to withdraw amendments Nos. 6 and 8 so I will speak to amendment No. 7, which is the mildest of the three. It also answers the questions the Minister had about barristers or solicitors feeling they were being intrusive when asking somebody if there was any sort of safety implications or violence within the household. The effect of amendment No. 7 would be to insert in page 15, between lines 4 and 5, the provision that the solicitor must "advise the client that mediation is voluntary and may not be an appropriate means of resolving the dispute where the safety of the client and/or their children is at risk". It is just a line to remind the person that it is voluntary and may not be an option for the person if there is a risk to his or her safety. It does not mean asking the person questions or getting involved in his or her domestic dispute. Its purpose is to remind the parties that mediation is voluntary and it does not have to be taken up as an option. I will not go on. I will finish on that because we have a very important Bill to get to at 5 p.m. It is a mild amendment and I hope the Minister can support us on it.

It is a very simple instruction. When solicitors are explaining the option of mediation to clients, they would include in the explanation advice that mediation is voluntary and may not be an appropriate means of resolving a dispute where the safety of the client or his or her children is at risk. I will not go into the contact we have had which we have already talked about. It is a simple proviso that makes sure a situation will not arise where people feel because a professional is telling them they have to do something that they need to do it. If there is an underlying concern in respect of domestic violence, even if it is not the issue at hand, it may affect the power dynamic and it may affect the experience of mediation. It is a neutral proviso which can be communicated by solicitors to all clients. As the Minister outlined earlier, people will have the option to choose not to proceed because it is voluntary but this underscores the option for people who may come from a climate of intimidation and may feel intimidated or pressed to oblige. It would be constructive if the Minister accepted this amendment.
#FrancesBlack	unknown-#FrancesBlack-party	unknown-#FrancesBlack-dob	unknown-#FrancesBlack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	195	I wish to repeat what my colleague, Senator Ruane, said. We support the legislation but this amendment is very important for a number of reasons. In my work with the RISE Foundation, which works with families who have somebody they love with an alcohol, drug or gambling problem, families often experience trauma, particularly when it comes to some form of domestic violence or controlling behaviour and they do not know how to cope with it. They might present themselves in front of a lawyer such as a solicitor, terrified, feeling the trauma and looking for guidance. My only concern is that if this is recommended to them, they will do it and it may be dangerous for them. That is my concern so this is a really important amendment. I hope with all my heart, in particular because of the families I work with, that the Minister will support it.

I support the spirit of these amendments, in particular amendment No. 7, which is the most precisely drafted of the three. It seeks to address the issue identified by Women's Aid and others and it is recognised in the text of section 3 of the Bill that domestic violence cases are not suitable for mediation. This is a sensible way of seeking to address cases which are not directly domestic violence proceedings but in which there may be safety issues for a client and his or her children. It is a sensible way of seeking to address the concerns we all expressed, including those I expressed yesterday on Second Stage.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	197	While I fully accept the intentions of the proposers of the amendment, the section sets out quite clearly that a client should be advised to consider mediation as a means of attempting to resolve a dispute which is the subject matter of proceedings. It is about advising clients to consider mediation, not that they must engage in mediation. It is about considering it, which is adequately dealt with in the section. Every legal adviser has to advise people that going into mediation is voluntary and that they do not have to go into mediation if they do not want to. They would have a legal obligation regardless of what is in the Act. It is about considering going into mediation, not saying that a person has to. The Bill adequately deals with that issue.

A remark made by Senator Black is worth reiterating at this late stage. We support the Mediation Bill, what it is about and what it is trying to do. We have tried to work with the Minister as I said yesterday to try sincerely to enhance the nature of the Bill. The proposal contained in this amendment is a modest one. It is in many ways a bit of a compromise proposal. Perhaps in the spirit of an pholaitíocht nua - the new politics - the Minister might reflect on what contributors have said and the reasons why they want to make the proposal in this amendment a reality.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	199	I have been considering this amendment and the consequences to which it would give rise since it was tabled. I acknowledge the Senators' intention, but I do not believe new politics is the exercise of consensus just for the sake of it. We have an obligation to ensure that the laws we enact and the amendments we make do not have consequences that might not be immediately apparent. I have listened carefully to the contributions of the four Senators but to achieve the objective they seek would require amending the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996. This amendment will not achieve the objective in question because the relevant Acts to which the Senators refer are those I mentioned. Section 14 of the Bill imposes obligations on those acting for clients, particularly legal professionals, to advise the clients to consider using mediation as a means of resolving the dispute, as Senator Colm Burke said, and to provide them with information concerning the advantages and benefits of using mediation as an alternative to court proceedings. They must provide the information on the availability of services, including details of persons who will provide such services. As we have acknowledged from the outset, the core principle in this legislation is that mediation is a voluntary process. Having regard to the voluntary nature of the process, there are times when mediation will not be an appropriate means of resolving a dispute and one of those is where domestic violence has occurred or where the safety of a party or a minor is at risk. I again emphasise that the core of the Bill is that mediation will remain a voluntary process. This is clear from the definition in section 2, so there is no need to mention the voluntary aspect of mediation anywhere else in the Bill. It is already included. I understand the concerns of Senators regarding cases in which domestic abuse or safety issues might arise in the context of family law proceedings or in cases involving custody issues or access for children. As I mentioned with regard to an earlier amendment, section 14(4) provides that this section, including its obligations on solicitors and legal personnel, does not apply in cases of applications under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996. Separate mediation related obligations on solicitors are set out in sections 5 and 6 of the 1989 Act in the case of judicial separation applications and in sections 6 and 7 of the 1996 Act. Those sections are amended in sections 25 and 26 of the Bill in order to ensure consistency and coherence between the 1989 and 1996 Acts and this legislation. I note what the Senators said about opting for what has been described as the softest of the amendments, No. 7, but I am unable to accept any of the amendments because section 4(14) disapplies its provisions in respect of family law proceedings under the 1989 Act and divorce proceedings under the 1996 Act. That is the difficulty. Of course, should the Seanad decide to accept the amendment, however well-intentioned that decision might be, it would have the effect of requiring the Dáil to sit next week to deal with the matter.

I am delighted to be proposing my second item of legislation along with the five other members of the Civil Engagement group. One of the core objectives of that group is to reach out and to voice the concerns of marginalised people who often lack a political voice and to connect with them through supporting NGOs, charities and other civil society organisations. We have done that effectively with this Bill. We have worked closely and in strong partnership with Cork-based Nasc, Oxfam and the Irish Refugee Council and through them, people directly affected. I thank all three organisations for their support and assistance over the last month. I also thank the other Senators from across the House who have expressed their support for this Bill, which is very encouraging. Finally, I thank our support staff, Mr. Pádraig Rice, and Mr. Simon Murtagh from the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, who strongly encouraged me to pursue this issue when we shared an office last summer. Let me start the debate by saying how desperate the situation is for people around the world. We are facing an unprecedented global refugee crisis, the likes of which we have not seen since the Second World War. Sixty-five million people have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict and persecution - the highest number ever recorded by the United Nations. There are currently over 22 million refugees, half of whom are children. This crisis is separating families. It is wrenching children from their parents and grandparents, dividing siblings and destroying extended family networks. The great Daniel O'Connell once said:My sympathy with distress is not confined within the narrow bounds of my own green island. No — it extends itself to every corner of the earth. My heart walks abroad, and wherever the miserable are to be succoured, or the slave to be set free, there my spirit is at home, and I delight to dwell there.I echo those sentiments today. As a small island nation, with a history of emigration and famine, we have a moral obligation to do what we can, when we can, wherever we can to help refugees in need and their families. We also have a legal obligation. The right to refuge from conflict and persecution and the right to family life are enshrined in international human rights law. At a national level, the Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann, specifically recognises the value of the family as "the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law." Despite this strong moral and legal basis, Ireland is not living up to its moral and legal obligations to protect the right to family life for refugees. Ireland is also failing to adequately share responsibility for those affected by the global displacement crisis. Two years ago, the Government made a commitment to welcome 4,000 refugees by the end of 2017 through the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. However, thus far, we have only welcomed a total of 1,259 people, less than a third of our pledge. These figures only serve to mask the enormous human tragedy unfolding before our eyes. The Bill before the House is a modest proposal. It is about family, what we understand to be family and how we define family. How we define family in law today affects desperate people very directly. I ask the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and others here to close their eyes, if they will, and think of what family means to them? Who does the Minister consider to be his family? In Ireland, we consider our nieces and nephews like our own. Our brothers and sisters are often our nearest and dearest. Our grandparents are loved, respected and adored. Modern Ireland is also home to many non-traditional families. Most recently, we saw the Irish people overwhelmingly support the right of LGBT couples to be recognised as family before the law. I would say to anyone who asked me that I come from a big family but according to the current definition, my family would include my husband only, not my children because they are over 18, not my brothers and sisters, my lovely sisters-in-law and brother-in-law and my father-in-law, and not my 25 nieces and nephews and their 29 children, the youngest grand-nephew of whom, Conor, was born before Christmas. As the law stands, I would not be able to reach out and help many of those I consider to be part of my family even if they were depending on me for support. Only last year my nephew took me in when I had no place to stay in Dublin. Another time, another nephew lived with me in London for six months after college and we supported him with his "start". My daughter, who is now earning, will help her brother with money, I am sure, when we go on holidays next month. Grandparents up and down the country help their sons and daughters with child care. Why? Because we are family in its widest sense. Only last Monday I heard a lovely story about brothers unexpectedly reuniting in New York city. The brothers had never met previously as the older brother, an economic migrant, left home before his younger brother was born. It is unIrish to think of the family as just one's husband or wife and children under 18. Family is rightly so much more. It is also not the way of Irish people to abdicate responsibility for family members in grave need. The International Protection Act 2015, which we seek to amend, came into effect 31 December 2016. It has had a detrimental impact on refugee family reunification, making it difficult, and almost impossible, for family members outside of the nuclear family to reunite with their loved ones. The 2015 Act changed Ireland's family reunification policy by removing the category of dependants which existed under the original Refugee Act 1996. This narrowed the eligibility for reunification to spouses and children, if the children are under the age of 18 and unmarried, and parents and parents' minor children, if the applicant seeking reunification is under the age of 18 and unmarried. Senior lawyers have told me that the current definition is on a questionable constitutional footing and it is only a matter of time before it is challenged in the highest courts in the land at great cost to the State. We do not need to wait for that to happen, nor leave any more families in limbo. We can fix it today. Amending the legislation on family reunification to restore the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996 not only offers Ireland an opportunity to show leadership in upholding fundamental rights but could also help meet our existing obligations under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme - a sign of good faith to the world that we want to share responsibility for those in need. This Bill proposes to do three things. The proposed legislative amendment would enable a broader group of dependants to apply for family reunification — a wider group of people can experience the joy of living in peace with their family. The following definition is inserted into the Act, "any grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian of the sponsor who is dependent on the qualified person or is suffering from a mental or physical disability to such extent that it is not reasonable for him or her to maintain himself or herself fully." The proposed legislative amendment restores the definition of the family to that of the Refugee Act 1996, with two exceptions. First, we have removed the Minister's discretion that was present in the 1996 Act. Given the strong legal basis for the protection of the family in Irish, European and International law, applicants for family reunification should be subject to a legal process to decide whether they meet the definition of the family in the Bill rather than the decision of an individual Minister. Second, we have deleted the timeframe that specifies the application for family reunification must be submitted within 12 months of a person being declared a refugee or beneficiary of subsidiary protection in Ireland. In Oxfam's and the Irish Refugee Council’s experience, when families are fleeing conflict and persecution they can end up scattered across the world. They can spend significant time being moved from country to country and often lack knowledge of the whereabouts of one other. Many flee without their documents. It can therefore take longer than 12 months for family members to be located by their relatives and for an application for their reunification to be made. Passing this Bill will provide safe and legal access for the family members of refugees to a new life. We all live better when surrounded by the ones we love and the ones who love us. This Bill gives us a chance to review and reflect on the current process. I was not a member of the previous Oireachtas but my feeling is that the International Protection Act 2015 may have been passed with haste. Its terms are too narrow and ungenerous.Our earlier thinking, outlined in the 1996 Refugee Act, which we seek to restore, was wiser, better, broader and in tune with the Irish understanding of family. We held a meeting on refugee family reunification yesterday at which Stephen Collins, a solicitor from the Irish Refugee Council, was present. He gave us examples of situations where people might be excluded from family reunification at the moment, perhaps as an unintended consequence of the redefinition of the family, but who may qualify for reunion if our Bill is passed. The first is a young woman from a war-torn country in Africa. Rebels killed her parents and kidnapped her sister. This woman escaped to Ireland where she applied for protection. She initiated a Red Cross family tracing request to try to find her sister. The Minister granted her refugee status in June 2017. In July 2017, the Red Cross contacted her to say that her younger sister is in a refugee camp in Kenya. The girl is alone and dependent on the woman because their parents are dead. The woman applied for family reunification. The Minister refused, saying that minor dependent siblings do not fit the definition of family in the 2015 Act. The second was a gay man from Zimbabwe, a country where men are sent to prison for falling in love. The man in question has been with his partner for five years. The relationship was discovered and he was outed, so he fled. When he got to Ireland, he applied for his partner, who is under risk of attack, the person he loves most and whom he is desperate to see again, to be allowed to join him. The application was refused because of the narrow definition in the current Act which does not recognise those who are not legally married. Across these Houses, today and day after day, people proclaim us to be a beacon of hope for LGBT people around the world, a beacon that beckons LGBT people to our shore. However, if we discriminate against them when they arrive, we are not showing a good example. If Senator Norris were here today, I am sure that he would say it is a disgrace. Those men are being punished twice: beaten and tortured at home and discriminated against when they flee. The third case is that of a woman whose husband had been imprisoned arbitrarily by the military in her country. She managed to escape and was granted refugee status in Ireland. She initiated a family tracing search with the Red Cross but it could not help to find her husband. Years later she got a message online to say there was news. Her husband had been released from prison and was alive. Her application for family reunification was refused because it was past the arbitrary 12-month deadline for applications. There are also issues around unaccompanied children. If they get refugee status on or after their 18th birthday, they cannot apply for any family members to join them. These young people need the support, guidance and love only a family can give. Their integration into Irish life would be enhanced if they had a brother, mother, father or sister by their side. A glimpse of the good this Bill could do and the difference it would make to people's lives if passed was shown to us yesterday by Mr. Collins. He spoke of an Iraqi man whose application was successful. He spotted him walking down the North Main Street in Cork, filled with pride, pushing a buggy with his lovely young son in it. Those who oppose this Bill will say the floodgates will open and we will be overrun. Last year there were only a few hundred applications for family reunification. The Tánaiste told The Irish Times in February after a visit to Greece, a fellow EU state, that keeping child refugees in cages is unacceptable, as she witnessed. However, as Fiona Finn of NASC told us, some of those children could be out of those cages and with their wider family if this Bill passes. The Tánaiste went on to say:The scale of the problem demands a global response. Sadly we are seeing such a disappointing and disproportionate response to the biggest challenge of our times from some quarters.These are the Tánaiste's words, not mine. The Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Ms Emily Logan, said in the same article that Ireland's family reunification programme is too restrictive and likely to cause considerable hardship for refugee families. This was echoed by the assistant High Commissioner of the UN refugee agency, who visited Ireland last month. Improving family reunification was also a key recommendation of a recently published Oireachtas joint committee, whose members are drawn from all sides of this House. Passing this Bill will make real and positive change in real people's lives. If the passage of the Bill only enables one man to walk down Cork's ancient North Main Street in peace with a loved one in a buggy, it would be worth the effort. My Civil Engagement colleagues and I kindly ask the House's support to do the right thing - the family thing. I commend the Bill to the House.
#FrancesBlack	unknown-#FrancesBlack-party	unknown-#FrancesBlack-dob	unknown-#FrancesBlack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	205	I am delighted to second the Bill today and very happy to work alongside my colleague, Senator Colette Kelleher, and my Civil Engagement group colleagues on legislation that I believe can change Ireland for the better. It was a pleasure to launch the Bill on the plinth this morning. I especially thank Senator Kelleher for her hard work and I also thank her personal assistant, Pádraig Rice, and my personal assistant, Conor O'Neill. I join her in commending the Irish Refugee Council, Oxfam Ireland and Nasc on their help and dedication. We should be clear from the start that this is not a complicated Bill. It is small, meaningful legislation that would see us treat refugees arriving in Ireland with a little more compassion, kindness and understanding. It recognises that people fare better with their family around them. It recognises that under our current system, the definition of family is just too narrow. It separates children from their parents and grandparents, divides siblings and keeps loved ones apart. This is not a humane response to the most serious humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. The best test of the fairness of such a system is to ask ourselves who we consider family. How many members of this House would include their parents or siblings in its definition? When we think of family, do we include our children aged more than 18 years? What about a grandparent, particularly someone who is older and dependent on us for care? The majority of Irish people know that this is what we mean when we say "family", and this Bill recognises it. The age factor is also very important. In many cases, it is often more senior family members who are left behind or people who are older and infirm. I was struck by a case raised by Oxfam yesterday of an Afghan family who had fled and sought refuge in Greece. One family member was identified as vulnerable and requiring medical treatment, so they were taken to Athens. The grandmother, however, was left behind, alone and in appalling and squalid conditions on the island of Lesbos because she did not fit this narrow definition of family member. This caused huge emotional distress for the family members who were relocated as well as for the grandmother who was left behind, alone and with no support. This is an appalling situation and something we cannot stand over. I ask every Senator to take a moment to consider what that must feel like and to imagine being put in the position of having to make that kind of choice where, having been granted refugee status and safety, one knows that if one goes, one is leaving behind a grandmother or dependent loved one. It seems that in some cases our restrictive system asks people to choose between their family or their life. This is not a humane way to treat people fleeing persecution and war. This Bill seeks to change that. It is important to note we are not pushing for something radical or new. We are asking to return to the family reunification system that operated in this country for the past 20 years or so until it was restricted quite recently. As it stands, Irish law states that refugees accepted in Ireland can apply for family members to join them. This does not mean a free pass or that it is easy. The same security checks and controls still apply. The change we are discussing today simply means that a grandmother can qualify as a member of the family. That is not moving mountains. It is basic compassion and understanding. What is important is that not only is this policy more humane, it is also the smart approach when it comes to integration. Imagine being in those shoes. If a person were to land in a new country, knowing no one and after experiencing God knows what horrors along the way, would it be easier for that person to start again with his or her family alongside him or her or for him or her to be on his or her own? How can a person focus on a new home, community and life when he or she does not know if his or her children or parents are safe from harm on the other side of the world? These people have already been through so much. It is harrowing to hear about the additional trauma, stress and anxiety caused by constant worrying about the welfare of one's loved ones. If we are serious about integration and making a success of refugee resettlement in Ireland, we should have the sense to know that it is much easier when families are kept together to support one another. This is not only the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. This issue is also very important to me as a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality. We were recently asked to carry out an extensive and far-reaching review of Ireland's migration, asylum and refugee systems. It was a shocking and sometimes depressing process. It highlighted clearly the deep flaws and injustices that still exist in these systems today. I know my colleague, Senator Alice Mary Higgins, will expand on this in detail later as she is working closely on and is passionate about these issues as well. During the review we heard directly from unbelievably brave campaigners about what it is like to live as an undocumented migrant in Ireland, often confined to the shadows and margins of society. We saw the national disgrace that is the system of direct provision where asylum seekers are warehoused in for-profit centres for years on end. They are denied proper cooking facilities, real access to higher education, the right to work and basic respect for their human dignity. It is clear there are bigger and wider questions about how we treat migrants in this country. I have raised these issues in the House before and I will continue to push to correct them. One of the five key recommendations we made in the review was to fix the system for family reunification.It is clear this is important from talking directly with refugees and those affected, as well as from speaking with civil society and community groups working in this area. It matters to families. It is something meaningful we can do now and I hope for strong support in the Chamber today. Yesterday we met two young men from Syria who were generous enough to come to speak about the Bill in the audio-visual room. To respect their privacy, I will not mention their names but both have refugee status and have made Ireland their home. However, while the first successfully applied to be reunited with his parents under the old definition, after years living and working in Dublin the second was told that his parents do not count as family under the new restrictive definition. That is just not right and we need to change it. It is also important to state this is a real, tangible step we can take to help us meet our commitments in terms of refugee resettlement. As it stands, Ireland has pledged to take in just 4,000 refugees. While that is a tiny number in the midst of a global crisis, despite the extremely low bar we have taken in less than a third of the amount. Returning to a more humane, sensible system of family reunification would give us a clear path to meeting the goals we set for ourselves. I urge Senators from across the House to support this legislation from me and the Civil Engagement group. It is a straightforward, meaningful Bill that can make people's lives a little better. Refugees in Ireland already have the right to apply for reunification with family members. We now need to be reasonable, fair and humane about what a family is.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	206	The Minister has been in the House practically all day. That said, he is always very welcome. I commend Senators Kelleher and Black and their colleagues on tabling what I consider to be very important legislation. Family reunification is very important to all of us. Whenever any of us are in trouble, who are the people we rely on? It is the people who are nearest and dearest to us, namely, our family members, our brothers, sisters and parents. When one moves out it is like dropping a pebble into a puddle of water. The most intensive ripples are at the very centre and as one goes out further the effect is diluted. It is the same with family. When a person faces a crisis it becomes a family crisis and the family is there to support the individual. I have always believed in the principle that if we take in a refugee then we should also be able to take in their immediate family. I listened with great interest to Senator Black talk about the 4,000 refugees we have committed to take in this country. Personally, I think that should be 40,000 and there is a school of thought that it should be 400,000. We would be well capable of dealing with 40,000 whatever about 400,000. That said, the Government position is to take 4,000. I sincerely hope the Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will meet the target of 4,000 in the not-too-distant future. I commend the Minister and his officials and the people who make the targets happen on a daily basis because it is not easy. We have a housing crisis and many other crises in this country. Accommodation is considered an exceptionally important facility to be able to provide to refugees when they come to this country. The challenges are not small; they are enormous. The Bill has been tabled by people who have a deep sense of social conscience and we need to recognise that. I said already that I personally would prefer to see the Bill move on from Second Stage to Committee Stage but I await the Minister’s decision in that regard. I suspect that will probably happen anyway, whether or not the Government supports the Bill. This House has always been a Chamber that prided itself on championing human rights. One can look back at our proud record over many decades and point to the father of the House, Senator Norris, and the campaigning he did for something that is nearly taken for granted today. We should never lose that as a Seanad. The people voted to retain this Chamber because they saw it as one that stood up for the underprivileged, those on the margins of society and those who faced challenges. It stood up for the difference between right and wrong. I would like to think this Chamber will continue to do that. We have debated very important legislation today in terms of the Mediation Bill and the Independent Reporting Commission structure for Northern Ireland. They are all extremely important but this is equally if not more important because we are talking about the most disenfranchised people coming from a war zone, fleeing torture and a place where human rights are not protected or respected. As such, we need to not just open our country but to open our hearts as well. I come from a town in west Clare called Ennistymon where we welcomed nine Syrian families about three months ago. Of course there was some local unease as to how it would work and how the people would integrate but I am pleased to inform the House that those people have integrated fantastically. The local North West Clare Family Resource Centre has done enormous work in terms of making those Syrian families welcome and they are now considered part of our community. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about the Bill. I consider it to be very important. I commend Senators Kelleher and Black and their staff for putting the Bill together. The Bill might not be perfect but it can be made perfect on Committee Stage. If people have concerns about certain elements of the Bill they can always table amendments on Committee Stage. I would encourage people to do that. This debate allows for engagement. As far as I am concerned the Bill is about doing the right thing. I sincerely hope the Bill moves on to the next Stage.
#RobbieGallagher	unknown-#RobbieGallagher-party	unknown-#RobbieGallagher-dob	unknown-#RobbieGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	207	The Minister's continued presence in the House is welcome and I thank him for that. I compliment both Senators Kelleher and Black for bringing forward this very important piece of legislation. Fianna Fáil supports the principles of the Bill which will enable, subject to certain conditions, a wider range of family members of people who have been granted protection in this country to be reunited with them. When the 2015 International Protection Bill was going through the Oireachtas, Fianna Fáil also proposed amendments to that effect. Fianna Fáil supported the passage of the 2015 International Protection Act as it provided for the introduction of a single procedure for international protection applications, which was a key recommendation of the McMahon group on direct provision. The introduction of a single or unified procedure replaced the previous system, in which eligibility for refugee status and subsidiary protection status were considered sequentially. That was very welcome as the sequential nature of the old system led to excessive delays in the processing of applications, resulting in asylum seekers spending many years awaiting a decision on their application, at great expense also to the taxpayer. Since the Act commenced there has, thankfully, been a considerable reduction in the time asylum seekers are spending in direct provision and that is very welcome. However, during the debate on the Bill in 2015 Fianna Fáil made clear our reservations and concerns about a number of areas in the Bill and we brought forward amendments on foot of those concerns. One of those areas was family reunification, which Senator Kelleher's Bill addresses. As the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission pointed out, the definition in the 2015 Act of a "member of family" who may enter and reside in the State in section 55 was narrow and it notably excluded dependants. The commission recommended that consideration be given to the range of family relationships to which Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights can apply in the context of this legislative proposal. The Act does not provide any means for a refugee or person eligible for subsidiary protection to apply for family reunification with other dependent family members including parents, wards, grandchildren and other dependants. As outlined by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, refugee families rarely fit neatly into the notion of a nuclear family, that is, husband, wife and minor child.A broad definition of a family unit, or what might be termed an extended family, is necessary to accommodate all refugees at any given time or situation. The Refugee Act 1996 included the possibility for refugees to apply for dependent family members, meaning any grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian of the refugee who is dependent on that refugee or is suffering from a mental or physical disability to such an extent that it is unreasonable for him or her to maintain himself or herself fully. No similar provision was included in the 2015 Act. Great concern was expressed at the time that the provisions in this Act were inadequate and would particularly affect very vulnerable family members, including adults with disabilities and orphans and wards who had become part of the sponsored family unit. The 2015 Act also permits the Minister to set a time limit within which a family member granted family reunification must enter the State. There was concern that the introduction of such restrictions might not take into consideration any exceptional measures or obligations that might arise and present travel difficulties. In the experience of many groups working in this area, it is common for delays to occur when family members travel to Ireland. Delays might arise in obtaining entry visas to Ireland or exit visas from the home country, in acquiring travel documents, in raising the cost of travel, especially for large families, and in making arrangements for the care of family members who are not eligible to travel. There is also concern that in some circumstances the safety of the family may be jeopardised if they are required to travel when it is not safe to do so. The 2015 Act also limits the right to family reunification to the 12-month period after the sponsor has been recognised as a person in need of international protection. Previous legislation did not contain this restriction. Fianna Fáil argued in 2015 that this time period should be removed as it would have a severe impact on the most vulnerable family members who may have become separated, or even imprisoned, while fleeing conflicts. I now come to the Fianna Fáil amendment to this Bill. We believe, just as we did in 2015, that the removal of the extended family members provision from the law was a retrograde move. We agree with extending the right to apply for family reunification to extended family members dependent on the qualified person. We also support the provision of the Refugee Act 1996, however, that allowed for ministerial discretion in its application. We have tabled an amendment to this effect for Committee Stage and hope Senator Kelleher will accept it.

It is no harm for us to look at what this Bill is trying to do. The intention behind it is to provide refugees, or individuals eligible for protection or consideration, to apply for members of their families, including grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren, wards or guardians, to enter and reside in this State. That is fair and reasonable. This issue concerns human dignity, human rights and human respect. I have been thinking about the old expression of "céad míle fáilte", or a hundred thousand welcomes. For so many people, however, there is no welcome and that is one of the sad realities of Irish society. Before going into the detail of this Bill, I acknowledge the enormous work put into this by the Civil Engagement group, namely, Senators Kelleher, Ruane, Black, Higgins, Dolan and O'Sullivan. From the very day these colleagues came into the House, they clearly set out the parameters of their agenda of social conscience and justice. The have very clearly demonstrated this as a group. Today, as we wrap up the last day of our current term, I want to acknowledge their enormous and consistent work in this area.

I will have more to say tomorrow. I also acknowledge the enormous background work Nasc has done in preparing politicians in both Houses on issues around migrants and ethnic minorities, be it access to human rights, access to work, or the creation of a fair and just society. This Bill is about creating that fair and just society. We have frequently heard this expression being paraphrased in recent months. Many people profess to be Christians and to bring that particular ethos into their work and political life. I have always admired this and admired politicians who bring their beliefs to the heart of their political conviction rather than parking them outside the door. I am one of those politicians and I do not apologise for it. It is important we acknowledge that there are people fleeing war, terror, anguish, and separation from their families and loved ones. Bunreacht na hÉireann defines the importance of family. This is what we live by and what we are committed to as democratic politicians. We talk about the special place that recognises and protects the family as a natural, primary and fundamental unit in our society and as a moral institution, possessing inalienable and indescribable rights. Why would we not want those rights for anyone else? We must seek these rights for citizens and open the door to other humans. This is a matter of human rights. We must afford people dignity and respect and help them get access to justice, work, inclusivity and human rights. This is only right. I commend Senator Conway's discussion of what makes up family and the ripple effect of family. Family are the people born into our bloodline, but in the broader sense they are also the people whom we bring around us. These are our loved ones, our companions, the people who are there for us when we are in trouble and who seek to vindicate and defend our rights. These are the people we want closest to us and we need to support them. I am not happy simply to carry on to the next Stage, which is just an exercise in political box-ticking. From the very first Stage of this process I want us to send out a clear message that we in Ireland have learned from our own experience of mass emigration. We cannot talk on the one hand about supporting and giving rights to Irish citizens living in the United States, while at the same time having a problem with giving rights to people in our own jurisdiction.

Surely it is incumbent upon us, therefore, to respond to matters in our own country in a human and compassionate way. It is really important that people wishing to be reconnected with their loved ones and family members be given that right. It is not good enough to talk about the constitutional rights of Irish citizens if we cannot extend the ethos, meaning and underlying validation of those rights to others. I commend this legislation. I will support it on every Stage because it is the right, fair and just thing to do and it is, therefore, worthy of support.

I hope it gets cross-party support both in this House and in the Dáil and sees its passage through both Houses. A person's tribe, clan, people, roots, history, memory-makers, traditions and very security in this world are what make up family. Last May, I ran a mental health campaign called 30 Days of May. As part of this I met many stakeholders and heard their perspectives on our mental health services. One group I remember as being particularly impressive was a group of young people who had come through the direct provision system. They outlined to me the challenges to their mental health as they tried to navigate the institutionalisation of that system. One young man gave a powerful account of what it was like to be here in Ireland without his family.He got upset when discussing what it was like to celebrate his birthday here alone, and who he looked to for a hug when he passed his leaving certificate and there was no one there. He had no anchor. His family was far away. Nobody had his back. It is stories like that of this young man that highlight the absolute need for this Bill before the House. The current laws on family reunification for refugees leave much to be desired. One of the most shocking parts is the current reunification law that does not allow for adult children to be brought here if their parents have refugee or immigrant status. Imagine me having to leave my 18, 19 or 20-year old child in a war-torn area. Imagine making it to Europe but having been separated from one's young adult child, and being unable to be reunited for fear of deportation. Our family is the intimate domestic group made up of people related to one another by bonds of blood and legal ties. It is a very resilient social unit that has survived and adapted through time. What do the vast majority of people in Ireland do when something traumatic or shocking happens? They gather around the kitchen table with their family and stick on the kettle. They surround themselves with their loved ones. We hold our families so dear that it is enshrined in our Constitution, and when Ireland was the first country to pass marriage equality by popular vote, we showed that we recognised and value the various types of family in modern society. Yet, currently in Ireland, refugees - those people who have suffered absolute trauma - are not allowed the same. This is a disgrace and it stains the Irish name as a place of céad míle fáilte. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, guidelines support the principle in this Bill, and if Ireland wants to be considered a leader in humanitarian response to refugee crises, then UNHCR is certainly the place to start. It argues that a refugee family is essential to ensure protection and well-being of all its individual members. It goes on to state that refugee families are often reconstructed out of the remnants of various households that depend on each other for mutual support, survival and love. These families may not fit neatly into preconceived notions of the nuclear family. The UNHCR goes on to describe how the composition of families may be influenced by the refugee experience. If the extended family survives or remains together, it becomes the immediate family. Our Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality's Report on Immigration, Asylum and the Refugee Crisis also facilitates this Bill. In a recommendation on family reunification, it calls on the Government to introduce a humanitarian admission programme to offer a safe and legal route for people to flee conflicts and be reunited with family members in Ireland. The Bill before the House is a great way to start this more humanitarian approach and response. Not only does it fit wider policy recommendations, but it has benefits for Ireland. Separation from one's family causes strain and stress on well-being, which impacts on people's ability to connect, integrate and contribute to society. I remind this House that we committed to taking 4,000 refugees and we are falling short of the mark. Using family reunification would be a quick and effective way to reach this target in the short term. The overarching reason we should all support today's Bill is for the real people that it will directly impact. We have all seen the images and videos of the terror that is causing this crisis, and I use that term with a heavy heart, because people are not a crisis to manage. They are people to connect and share with, but the images are painful to watch. Imagine how much more painful they would be if one knew one's aunt, adult child or grandparent was stuck there, unable to join him or her in Ireland. This is a cruel and inhumane set-up. Family is everything. It is where our lives begin. It is our fundamental link to our past and a bridge to our future. It is the anchor for all of us. We have stood in this Chamber, and many more times in the Dáil, condemning the harrowing scenes that we have seen, so let us do something meaningful and pass this Bill.

I was involved in the original International Protection Act and many of these issues were raised at the time, but we were advised that all worries or concerns relating to the Bill were overstated, that this was the European norm and it had to happen and needed to be guillotined because of time sensitivity. It had to happen because of the direct provision report, and if it was passed, we would get a single procedure mechanism which every NGO and every international organisation was calling for us to have. After it was passed, the President, for the second time in his term of office, had to call the Council of State to see if it was constitutional. Now we have a situation of asylum seekers being handed 60-page documents to go through of which they have to make some kind of sense. The Seanad is now debating an amendment to the legislation in order to give justification to family rights of asylum-seekers. I have deep reservations about the capacity of the Minister's Department to deal with this issue. Running right through his Department is a suspicion of anybody who comes to this country seeking asylum. I think there is mistrust and a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the problem. I cannot remember a single meeting that I had with a senior official in the Minister's Department when I was in it as a Minister of State, working with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, where the term "pull factor" was not used. I do not think the Minister's Department has any capacity to deal with this issue. The entire area of asylum, integration and immigration needs to be taken out of it because the Department comes to this issue with a justice and defence mentality, a law and order mentality, and does not come to the issue with a sense of humanitarianism or decency. The Department sees the issue as a problem. I have come to the conclusion that the Department believes that half the people who are seeking asylum, if not more, are just liars. I have to say, reluctantly, that that is the sense I get from working in the Minister's Department. It breaks my heart after all the time I spent in that Department and every direct provision centre I visited. I know the Minister lives close to one in Portlaoise. The parish priest there has to be greatly commended on what he has said about that direct provision centre. A group of NGOs was invited by that Department to sit around the table with Department officials to come up with a direct provision report, which was a compromise on everybody's part. On the day that the report was announced, I made the comment at the press conference that this was the report that would be implemented because the Department had signed off on it. The then Minister for Justice and Equality sat there and said that it gives food for thought. It is a disgusting disgrace that not a single letter of that report has been implemented by now. When we had the Action Plan for Jobs, we had three-monthly or four-monthly updates, great fanfare and press conferences to say what had been achieved and which recommendations had been fulfilled. What has happened in the two years since the direct provision report was published? A couple of easy to fulfil recommendations were followed through. Every NGO that took part in that process did so with the best will in the world, and many had been mandated to call for the abolition of the process and signed away that mandate when they signed off on that document as a compromise because they thought the situation would be improved. What happened? It was not implemented in full, mainly, I believe, because the people with concerns are people who are not politically powerful. It is a disgrace, and that is why I think the Department is completely incapable. It hurts me to say that because I know many of the people in the Department and worked very closely with them, but the ethos and sense in the Department is of no sympathy and no humanitarianism when it comes to this issue. I genuinely believe that it does not belong in the Department any more. I fully concur with what Senator Boyhan said. It is the height of hypocrisy for this independent Republic to go anywhere and talk to anybody else about immigration rights.What a joke. What an international joke we are to end up in the White House every year asking for something to be done for the Irish abroad when we will not regularise the undocumented here in this country on the same basis and we still have one of the most restrictive asylum systems. We are one of only two European countries which does not allow asylum seekers the right to work. It is the height of hypocrisy because no European country knows what a coffin ship is like more than the Irish; no European country knows what it is like to flee a country because of violence more than the Irish; no European country knows what it is like to flee a country because of hunger more than the Irish; and no European country has a more mean-spirited asylum system than the Irish. What I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party is that despite the fact we were involved in the original international protection Bill, and given the context at the time, we fully support this Bill. As the new Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister has the opportunity to implement the McMahon report on direct provision. It would be a stunning legacy for him to leave behind if we were finally to put paid to all of the wrongs in the system. There are 1,500 fewer people in the system long term than there were two years ago, and I understand this and great credit should be given to the House for raising the issue consistently, but I go back to the fundamental point that this issue does not belong in the Department of Justice and Equality because it is not fit for purpose to deal with it on a humanitarian basis. Its mindset is one of security and law and order and it is not one that truly understands the nature of why people must flee their country because fundamentally the Department does not trust them.
#JohnDolan	unknown-#JohnDolan-party	unknown-#JohnDolan-dob	unknown-#JohnDolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	215	I am very happy to welcome the new Minister for this brief to the House. I reiterate what a number of speakers have already said on the core resilience in family. All of us have an experience of family. Sadly, some people's experience is of not having a family. Thankfully, many of us have a family, whether we are well off, snug or poor. We understand the deep well of resilience that comes around people in trouble when they are part of a family. It is the first line of defence. The idea of having a shaved down definition of family, as we do in the 2015 Act, does no justice to the power and resource for good that is in family. If this definition continues, it will not serve Ireland and it certainly will not serve the people concerned, because everybody finds themselves in trouble sometimes, with health or other issues, and that person's family is the first and most potent port of call to deal with these issues. It is not this or that agency or Department; it is the family around the person who has the most positive influence. It is important for the State to have that. I find it very difficult to find words for the idea that people with mental health or other disabilities would be excluded. Sometimes the people involved are members of the particular family and other times the people have been taken in by the family. I find it difficult to think about the idea they would be left behind in a situation like this, and certainly to countenance the idea the State would willingly participate in it. Our reputation and global moral suasion are other issues at play. They are not a particular specific part of the Bill. We, the Department and the other Departments the Minister was in know very well the factors that force people out of their countries and into a refugee situation from states that very often have no respect for people and no respect for human rights. If Ireland, as a small nation, does what I certainly consider the right thing and the very doable thing, it can have greater moral suasion in the world context. We have heard about floodgates over the decades every time we went to move, for example, with regard to women being able to stay in the Civil Service after they got married. There would not be a public service without them now. There is also the issue of maternity leave. We must be very careful of what I describe as a tired argument about floodgates. The key to this is that we have made a decision that people can have refugee status, and now, to artificially or in some sophistry through definitions state a family is not a family, and we have defined it by just cutting the heart and soul out of it and just a couple of people qualify if they are under 18, does not serve us. The decision that will control the numbers is the decision that has already been made on the number of refugees we are in a position and are committed to take. Going half the distance by having a cut down version of what a family is will not serve us and will not serve the people involved. I ask the Minister and the House to reflect on these points.

I welcome the stakeholders in the Gallery. Many of them have worked for many years on this issue and on having a more humane approach to welcoming those who come from outside these shores to Ireland. I speak as somebody who is the granddaughter of an immigrant who came here and gained asylum, and made an enormous contribution to Waterford through Waterford Glass. I was delighted to see the Minister in Waterford recently at a commemoration of a famous Waterford citizen, John Hearne. This is an important Bill to support. I endorse absolutely what Senator Ó Ríordáin said about culture. We must be careful that we do not slip into a knee-jerk reaction when we see a Bill of this kind, and refer constantly to the language of floodgates and the pull factor, on which others have expressed eloquently. This type of language can just mask the real trauma and significant reasons people come here to seek asylum and sanctuary, and why we need to take a more generous interpretation, in particular on family reunification. I am happy to support the Bill and to endorse the comments of my Labour Party colleague.

In particular, I commend my colleague, Senator Kelleher, and her staff who have done exceptional work on it. I also commend civil society organisations such as Nasc, the Irish Refugee Council and groups such as Spirasi, which works with survivors of torture, other groups that have contacted us, and Oxfam Ireland, which has brought an important international perspective and the refugee crisis into the debate. I also thank all those who generously shared their stories with us. We have heard some of the stories, and I will not enumerate more of them. We know there are many more such stories, even among the very few applications for family reunification we have had in Ireland. Last year, we had only 288 applications. For every one of those there is a story and an often desperate and deep desire to be reunited with family. There is a story similar to those cases we have heard today. We could enumerate all of them but, as my colleague said, if even any of those cases could find satisfaction and peace of mind through this legislation it would be excellent. Others have spoken to the Irish sense of family and our own personal interpretations of family. I would be a little more specific in terms of saying that the definition of family, as it currently stands in this legislation, goes against the spirit of our public policy, which has increasingly been moving towards recognising the diversity of households and family. We have seen in the Child and Family Relationships Act, for example, and in the referendum on marriage equality that the Irish public have a deep desire to recognise how diverse family can be and to recognise ties of love and care in all their forms. Having worked with Older and Bolder, an organisation which brings together all those in the age sector, I can testify that older people in Ireland regard that grandparents are part of a family and they regard themselves as part of a family. The understanding is there in our culture, our history and in other areas of our public policy. The legislation we are proposing today, in restoring the Refugee Act 1996, brings us back in line with the spirit of the rest of Irish policy in this area and it also recognises that, in fact, even since 1996, Ireland has widened its understanding of family to give a deeper understanding of, for example, LGBT partnerships. As someone else eloquently said in regard to refugees in particular, it is important to recognise the diversity and interdependency of households. The concept of dependency is crucial. In this legislation, we are not simply talking of those who have a family connection but we are also talking about ties of dependency and those who rely on each other. That is very important to affirm and is at the core of the legislation we are proposing. Recent case law at the European Court of Human Rights, for example, cases taken against the Netherlands, show that while national legislators have their subsidiary rights, they also need to be aware of human rights law and obligations in this regard. As well as the message of generosity and compassion we have heard today, there is also a duty under our international obligations because, when we offer somebody refugee status, we are not simply offering safety and sanctuary; we also take on the responsibility to be the vindicator of their rights and to protect them in the fullest sense, and to ensure they can live and be free. Part of that is vindicating their right to a relationship and to family, and to all of the benefits that flow from that. Some of the striking arguments I have heard, as we move to develop this legislation, are those which have been eloquently put forward in regard to integration, namely, that we integrate better when we are with our family, that families are the unit on which society is often built and that by bringing people's families with them, we provide the avenues for connection and integration for those who have been afforded the right to live and stay in this State. We ensure that this living and staying, and becoming part of the fabric of this State, is made more practically possible and real by ensuring that their families are with them to engage in a new social environment. Accepting this legislation would be very much in the spirit of our current policies of integration. I note with particular concern the position of 18-year olds, who can be very vulnerable. Under the legislation as it currently stands, 18-year olds who are not married, and who themselves have no children, have no right to anybody. They are sent on their own to Ireland and they are on their own in the world. The age of 18 is a vulnerable time. People coming out of their teenage years into their youth are in a position where they do not have an entitlement, even, for example, to have a sibling such as a 13 year old sister or brother to be with them, or an aunt or uncle. There is a real concern about people who are left as very isolated units within our society and extremely vulnerable to exploitation. We know about the exploitation of minors internationally and we have seen horrifying statistics on that across Europe. Another very valid and important concern is in terms of targeting. When loved ones are left in another country, it is not simply that one would wish for them positive new circumstances. In many cases, people fear for them because of the circumstances of conflict or oppression which forced somebody to seek refuge while knowing that other people are in that position, which is of immense concern. We have heard terrible stories of people being shown videos of family members in great distress in their home country. That can be used as a form of exploitation, targeting and pressure. Again, the 12-month period is a real obstacle of concern. Those who have managed to escape unlawful detention may have family members who are still in unlawful detention. This is a route to safe and legal passage, which Ireland says it wants to promote. We talked in this House just a few days ago about wanting to move against trafficking. This is a very practical, pragmatic, implementable route to safe and legal passage for the families of those who have achieved refugee status. Ireland has a moral leadership potential in this regard. I appeal to the Minister. We heard of the concerns in the Department of Justice and Equality but I know the Minister has come from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I hope the Minister would bring with him from that Department a real understanding of the factors which have driven the refugee crisis worldwide and an understanding of the role Ireland has played, for example, in convening a high level UN meeting on refugees. In addition, Ireland has actively sought a role in the UN Security Council and is chairing the Commission on the Status of Women, given women are often particularly vulnerable to restrictive family reunification. I urge the Minister to bring his understanding of human rights and Ireland's role on human rights into his new Department and brief, and to take that and make it a transformative force for how we deal with these issues. I had hoped to enumerate the many problems with the International Protection Act but, given the constraints on time, I will look forward to future opportunities to do so.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	218	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House and to take part in this debate and engage with Senators on this important issue. The stated purpose of the Bill is to extend the scope for a refugee or a person eligible for subsidiary protection for members of their extended family to enter and reside in the State. As has been said by Senator Higgins and others, the Bill seeks to reverse some of the reforms introduced in the International Protection Act 2015, which was piloted through the House by my former ministerial colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin. That Act was debated at length in both Houses of the Oireachtas and was passed by the Seanad in December 2015 with widespread support, including from Fianna Fáil. Although the Bill as set out contains a number of provisions, most of these are already in the 2015 Act, as Senator Kelleher and others will be well aware. In essence, the new elements of the Bill are as follows. It widens the scope of the definition of "member of the family" in sections 56 and 57 of the 2015 Act to provide for a refugee or a person eligible for subsidiary protection to apply for a grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian to enter and reside in the State, or where the family member is already in the State, to reside in the State. It provides for permission to enter and reside or reside in the State where these family members are dependent on the sponsor or are suffering from a mental or physical disability to such extent that it is not reasonable for him or her to maintain himself or herself. It removes the 12-month time limit introduced for a sponsor to make an application for a family member to enter and reside in the State. It should be noted that the provisions in sections 2(a) to section 2(d) of the Private Members' Bill already exist in law under the International Protection Act 2015. There has been some confusion on that in the debate. For example, I heard reference to LGBT partnerships quoted as though in some way they were not applicable or covered by the 2015 Act, when they are and will continue to be. I heard reference also to the constitutionality of the 2015 Act. It seems bizarre to me that some Senators have neglected to refer to the fact this issue was one that was a factor in the debate at pre-enactment stage. It was reviewed by the Council of State at the invitation of the President, it was referred to the Supreme Court and there the matter lies.The reforms introduced in the 2015 Act sought to bring Ireland closer to EU norms as provided for under the EU family reunification directive. Ireland does not participate in this directive, however, we consider it good practice to align ourselves with mainstream EU practice, although our family reunification provisions are more expansive than these norms and more expansive than the provisions of most of our EU colleagues. In the context of the UK departing from the European Union, we should not depart too significantly from the EU family reunification directive. It is very important to bear in mind that a significant expansion, which would reverse the 2015 reforms in the family reunification area, could have consequences for our efforts to protect the common travel area after Brexit, which I am sure Senators will regard as an important priority.  It is also important to consider and be mindful of the many issues faced by those in need of international protection and the challenges faced by governments who wish to stand in solidarity with refugees and asylum seekers at a time of great challenge nationally and internationally. This is a challenge across Europe and a challenge for Europe. This Government, as the House will recall, has been to the forefront of responding in solidarity with our European neighbours in ensuring that Ireland’s response to this crisis reflects the wishes of our people to offer sanctuary and protection in times of strife and difficulty, especially for those fleeing conflict. I acknowledge the role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR’s, Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, Volker Türk. During his visit in June he stated that "Ireland’s comprehensive response to refugees shows a level of commitment that is urgently needed from all countries". He also stated: Ireland’s international engagement shows the power of all countries, no matter their size, to affect real change. In practical terms, Ireland has not been found wanting - it is supporting those developing and middle income countries hosting the majority of the world’s refugees. It is also providing opportunities for some of the most vulnerable refugees to be resettled out of precarious situations so they build a future for themselves and their families. Ireland is now resettling 520 refugees a year, a figure we strongly encourage the authorities to maintain into the future. Those are not my words; they are the words of the UN Assistant High Commissioner for Protection. I wonder whether the former Minister of State, Senator Ó Ríordáin had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Türk. I suspect he did in the context of his ministerial duties. In fact I am sure he did. If he did, I doubt he told the assistant commissioner the story which he told us this afternoon during what was a bizarre contribution for somebody who piloted legislation and supported it through the House from start to finish without casting any of the aspersions on his then Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, which we have heard this evening. I find the Senator's contribution bizarre but I will not have the opportunity to concentrate on it tonight. Perhaps in the future we might be in a position to engage on it. I find his comments, as a former Minister of State who recently left the office, to be extraordinary. I will use the word "bizarre" again because in the circumstances it might be appropriate. During his conversation with Mr. Türk I am sure the Senator will have heard his comments specifically on his analysis of Ireland's recent process on international protection in which he stated, "Recognition rates of refugees had returned to European Union averages, while crucial reforms of asylum legislation and decreases in average processing times showed that change is possible with the right levels of political commitment".  Ireland’s practical response ranges from the ongoing actions of our Naval Service in the Mediterranean, through our three-year rolling funding of food aid for Syrian refugees, to our voluntary opt-in to the European relocation and resettlements programmes - all of which have been well set out in this House. It is important to note in the course of this debate the fact that we have doubled our resettlement commitments under this programme and have worked tirelessly, with some recent success, to accelerate the intake under the relocation programme. Ireland is stepping up to the plate when it comes to assisting people in crisis. We have put considerable investment and time into supports and efforts to ensure we can offer meaningful protection to vulnerable people and we will continue to do so, which I believe reflects the will of the Irish people, who have always been generous in their response to crises and adverse and challenging humanitarian situations.  The former Minister of State, Senator Ó Ríordáin, made reference to Mr. Justice McMahon's working group. I am sure he will have been following the progress of our efforts in respect of the McMahon report. He will note that many of these recommendations have already been dealt with. I acknowledge the challenge which was put to me by the former Minister of State and others. It will be a priority for me in my Ministry to ensure that all of the recommendations of the McMahon report will be followed up on and implemented. I acknowledge the work of Mr. Justice McMahon and I will continue to engage with him.  Members will be aware that the International Protection Act 2015 commenced on 31 December last, a mere six months ago. It is a positive and comprehensive response across the board in an area which had not been reformed for decades. It is essential that the new Act be given the time to embed itself and to ensure that all of its measures are functioning properly, so that the humane and balanced single procedure process can respond more effectively to the needs of those who claim and qualify for asylum. This issue formed a major part of the debate in respect of the pre-enactment Stages in the Seanad and the Lower House.  The fact that the Government has, in its voluntary participation in the resettlement and relocation programme, prioritised families is testament to that shared concern expressed by Senators today. Similarly we have responded to the situation in Calais by bringing unaccompanied minors here under the care of Tusla. I am very reluctant, within months of the commencement of this important reforming Act, to begin to disassemble it on a piecemeal basis before the entire process has the opportunity to function fully in the reforming manner in which it was introduced and which was intended by dint of the votes of those in this House who supported it. It is important that this new legislation be allowed to deliver certainty for families far sooner in the process. We must be allowed to make real our commitments under our existing programme and must not reintroduce open-ended schemes that can only mean uncertainty, longer queues and a reduction in our capacity to plan and provide for those most in need of the protection which we will give them under the current legislation.  The House should not be blind to the proactive powers used by my predecessors and myself to respond in other ways to cases of humanitarian concern. When I talk about my predecessors I am not sure if I can include the former Minister of State, Senator Ó Ríordáin. He seems to have removed himself from the process in a way which I feel is most unfair to my Department and its hard-working officials, many of whom worked with him very recently. It is important that we fully respond to cases of humanitarian concern in respect of families and especially around vulnerability, as has been pointed out.  I am reluctantly opposing the Bill. In doing so I emphasise that existing avenues for the admission of more extended family members are already available under the provisions of the non-EEA policy document on family reunification, which allows beneficiaries of international protection and other non-EEA migrants residing lawfully in Ireland to make an application at any time. As Minister, I can and do apply this discretion as regards the economic conditions for sponsors set down in the policy document and in cases of humanitarian need. Such applications on humanitarian grounds are examined on a case-by-case basis and I intend to continue this practice. I would be very happy to report to the House on this matter from time to time as required. As outlined at the outset, I wish to realign our family reunification policies with those which exist across the European Union. The 2015 Act was written to closely align Ireland with mainstream European practice and its current provisions on family reunification are not only in line with other EU member states, but are in parts less rigid and more flexible than those which exist in other jurisdictions. The Bill before the House seeks to amend sections 56 and 57 of the International Protection Act 2015 by reintroducing section 18(4) of the repealed Refugee Act 1996 and thus replacing subsections 56(8) and 56(9) of the 2015 Act. This removes the time limits introduced for making an application and effectively makes the application process for family reunification open-ended. The International Protection Act 2015 provides for a greatly simplified and shorter duration route to family reunification for those who are in need of it, while continuing to protect the best interests of children and spouses. Some of the key changes introduced in the 2015 Act include a new definition of a "member of the family" to align more closely with the definition in the EU family reunification directive and to include spouses, civil partners, children of the sponsor, parents and siblings of the sponsor. Under section 56 of the Act, in the case of spouse and civil partner the relationship must have been subsisting on the date the application for international protection was made. It is important that there be time limits because they mean certainty, which, in turn, means planning and offering the best protection available. The new provisions of the International Protection Act 2015 provide specific rights for family reunification and a pathway to reunification for family members of those granted international protection that is less restrictive in terms of the application time limits and the economic conditions than in many other EU member states. Ireland does not apply any economic conditions for eligible family members under sections 56 and 57 of the 2015 Act and it provides a more generous time limit of 12 months from the date when the grant of international protection is provided for beneficiaries to apply for family members to enter the State. In the circumstances, this is sufficient to deal with the majority of cases. The 2015 Act was drafted to strike a fair balance between maximising the number of new persons the State can accommodate under the programmes, coupled with a fair and reasonable approach to family reunification, which is in line with, and indeed is more liberal than, the norms in other EU member states. This is not just a question of more resources but of real and practical limitations, all of which are well known to Senators from debates that we hold on a daily basis. I am also mindful that there are already individuals and families in Greece waiting to come to Ireland under our existing relocation programme. Ireland will meet its relocation commitment to Greece in full, with 459 persons of the allocation of 1,089 people already in the State and the balance to come here by the end of the year. These people must be our priority now and each of those persons will have an entitlement to apply for family reunification. We plan for each person granted status to apply for an average of four family members under the current programmes. This is a major challenge and places significant demand on our services. The proposed Bill renders accurate planning almost impossible and, with an open-ended process as proposed, this would make capacity planning for new intakes under resettlement and relocation even more difficult than the challenges we now face. The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality recently issued a report on immigration, asylum and the refugee crisis which examines the issue of family reunification. I daresay there are Members of this House who are also members of that committee. It did not recommend widening the scope of the definition of "member of the family" in sections 56 and 57 of the International Protection Act 2015 or the removal of the 12-month time limit for a sponsor to make an application for a family member to enter and reside in the State. I acknowledge, in particular, the contribution of members of the Fianna Fáil Party. They, having made valuable contributions to the debate on the 2015 Act, are now supporting this Bill. They also made valuable contributions to the work of the committee but they did not raise any of the points that now seem to be issues of priority. Six months after the enactment of the 2015 Act, it is timely that we have an opportunity to discuss the Act, the process relating to it and the issues with which we are dealing this evening. It is important to continue to review the practices and procedures under the 2015 Act. In the meantime and while we do so, I regret that, on behalf of the Government and for the reasons outlined, I cannot agree to this Bill.

I have been here only a year but this is the most depressing moment of my time in the Seanad, hearing a Minister be so cold, callous and out of tune with his colleague, Senator Conway, who spoke very well, and with all parties in this Chamber. I have to be blunt - the Minister's speech was a disgrace, an absolute cold-hearted disgrace. It is easy to take pops at Senator Ó Riordáin. We know Labour got it wrong in 2015 and, yes, it was warned. I quote Senator Ó Clochartaigh from 2 December 2015 when he described the Bill as a "Trojan horse" that is rolling back on the human rights provisions of existing legislation and boy was he right. None of us get it right all the time. I applaud Senator Ó Riordáin's speech this evening and those of my colleagues in Civil Engagement and Fianna Fáil. It seems everyone is wrong except the Minister; even his Fine Gael colleague is wrong because he is right. It is cold, callous and shameful. It is not surprising that the Minister is on record as supporting apartheid in Israel. We know where he stands on the political spectrum - somewhere to the right of Genghis Khan. He should be ashamed of himself. I was at a presentation yesterday and we were all moved by it. Is the Minister telling me that the people at the Migrant Rights Centre are making up these allegations and that there is no basis for these claims or is he just not prepared to listen? I recognise Fianna Fáil's support for this Bill. I appeal to Senator Conway and his colleagues to have some courage because their Minister has been nothing less than disgraceful tonight. It does not surprise me because that is the tradition from which he comes. Not everyone in Fine Gael is like that. There are people with decent views in all parties. Are we going to let these people down? Are we going to make sure that families cannot be united? We know the Minister wants to do that but surely to God, collectively, we are better than that. The Minister should be ashamed of himself. This is the lowest point I have witnessed in this Chamber.

I am proud to be associated with this Bill. I thank my colleagues and I particularly thank Senator Kelleher for her role in it. All of the main points have been made. The International Protection Act 2015 might have been debated in these Houses but the Seanad and Dáil are very different now, with very different people in them. Senator Ó Riordáin might have been in the previous Government and will pay his penance for ever more for that but the rest of us were not. Had we been part of a Seanad that saw such a consequence come from the previous legislation, we would have made sure that it was not passed. I thank Fianna Fáil and Labour for recognising that sometimes Bills are passed and that we do not see their consequences straight away. Sometimes it is only on reflection that we see we should have done something else.Fine Gael should acknowledge that we do not get everything right all the time. It says more about us when we say, for example, that we should not have passed a Bill in its entirety and that we now have a chance to fix a part of it which would go a long way towards improving matters.  In general, the practical impact and effects of the International Protection Act have been extraordinarily concerning. We have all heard testimony about the vast and confusing new applications forms being issued. Refugees who have been in the system for years have been forced to start new application processes within unfairly tight deadlines and where the translations of the application forms into their native languages have been done using the Google translate site. I do not know whether the Minister has ever translated any text using that site, but sometimes it gets it completely wrong; therefore, I can only imagine what is being produced from it. People are signing forms without understanding what they involve because they are extremely scared about the prospect of deportation and opening themselves up to legal challenges as a result. Is the Minister confident that the Bill is fit for purpose? Since we are considering ways in which it could be improved, will he consider conducting a full review of the Act and some of its clear failings in practice? I was going to go into what "family" means, but, as the previous speakers articulated that so well, there is no point in doing so. I will finish with a quote from the late Tony Benn which adds to what Senator Paul Gavan said, "The way a Government treats refugees is very instructive because it shows you how they would treat the rest of us if they thought they could get away with it."

I am very disappointed that the genuine concerns expressed which are evidence-based and based on the real life experiences of people on the ground were not considered. The people concerned are finding that the new order, the new regime, is not humane. It is not working for them, despite the best of intentions, in the way intended when the Act was put in place, but as I was not here at the time, I do not know as I did not contribute to that debate. It is brave for a Minister or any of us in our position to reflect on the reality of the information coming to us and say we did not expect or intend it to happen, but now that we are seeing it happen, we will take stock and reconsider. Rather than being harsh with Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, I thought it was incredibly brave of the Minister to say what he did. He did not have to be here tonight; he could have been somewhere else and could have been paired. He could have avoided this debate, but he did not. He came and reflected on what he had been part of. We have all been in such situations. I have been responsible for many vulnerable adults and not everything for which I was responsible was always right. Sometimes the people around me and I got it wrong. The problem with that is, particularly in not getting it right for refugees and helping their families to connect with them or making it harder rather than easier, that it has a devastating impact on thier lives. I welcome Fianna Fáil's support for the Bill, which was given with caveats. All we want to do is reflect on a recent Act and highlight the problems arising to see if we can make things better, all in the spirit of family. As a citizen of this country, I do not want to be regarded as someone who gives with one hand and takes with the other and who has a mean-spirited attitude. Refugees are persons who need refuge and protection. We need to consider the merits of every person's case and understand that, like all of us, he or she comes from a family system. I heard a woman in Cork speak recently. Her mother has breast cancer, but she cannot bring her to this country and is suffering as a result. I do not know how I would feel in that situation. If it would not be good enough for me, why should it be good enough for her?  I am very disappointed the Minister is not able to support us. I am sure we will disagree on many issues, but I am very disappointed he will not hear us out. I am very sad that he is unable to take on board the genuine comments we have all made across the House. I appreciate the support of my fellow Senators, including the Minister's colleague, Senator Martin Conway, who would like to see the Bill proceed to the next Stage when we could tease out some of the points the Minister and others have raised in order to reach a better conclusion and do the right thing by people.

The convention, agreed and adopted in 2013, is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects of mercury. The convention focuses on a global and ubiquitous metal which, while naturally occurring, has broad use in everyday objects and is released to the atmosphere, soil and water from a variety of sources. Controlling the human sources of releases of mercury through its lifecycle has been a key factor in shaping the provisions under the convention. The provisions of the Minamata convention include: a ban on new primary mercury mines; the phasing out of existing ones; the phasing out and phasing down of mercury use in a number of products and processes; control measures on emissions to air and on releases to land and water; and the regulation of the informal sector of small-scale gold mining. The convention also addresses interim storage of mercury and its disposal once it becomes waste, as well as broader health issues. Ireland officially signed the convention in October 2013 at the diplomatic conference in Kumamoto, Japan.  The amendments before Senators today insert a new Part 8 into the Bill which will effect a ban on primary mercury mining in Irish law - implementing one of a number of actions necessary to allow Ireland to ratify the convention in 2017. The new section 224 provides definitions for a number of terms used throughout this new Part 8 such as "mercury", "mercury compound" and "primary mercury mining" - defined as "mining in which the principal material sought is mercury" - which reflect what is provided for in the convention. Section 225 makes it clear that the holder of a prospecting or retention licence will continue to be allowed to search for traces of mercury where the purpose of such exploration is to assist in the identification of other minerals. In addition, the use of mercury or mercury compounds for laboratory-scale research continues to be permitted. Section 227 proposes that a person who prospects for a primary mercury deposit commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class-A fine of currently up to €5,000 or on indictment to a fine not exceeding €250,000. Where the Minister authorises a person to mine any minerals or ores, such authorisation shall not permit extraction of mercury as a primary product or extraction of ores of mercury for the purposes of production of primary mercury. Extraction of trace quantities of mercury in the course of extraction of other minerals, ores or compounds will continue to be permissible provided the purpose of the extraction is not to produce mercury in metal or concentrate for sale or export. Such traces would be regarded as contaminants to be removed during the processing of the ore. Section 228 proposes that a person who carries out primary mercury mining commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class-A fine or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €250,000.Amendment No. 60 focuses on a legal anomaly that the Office of the Attorney General has requested be addressed in respect of the Continental Shelf Act 1968. The issue arises as a consequence of past transfer of function orders and departmental title orders. The issue was identified in the context of drafting the provisions for the forthcoming maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill in regard to the introduction of a licensing regime for offshore renewable energy and offshore natural gas storage activities. The Minerals Development Bill, which is already amending section 4 of the Continental Shelf Act, represents the first opportunity to address this issue. The amendment will allow my Department to continue to progress proposals for offshore renewable energy and offshore gas storage. The Continental Shelf Act asserts the State's right to the seabed and subsoil outside our territorial waters, that is, our exclusive economic zone, EEZ, and designated extended continental shelf for the purpose of exploring such seabed and subsoil and exploiting its natural resources. Section 5 of the Act is a key element in the consent process for the placing of structures on the seabed in the EEZ and the continental shelf. Sections 5, 7 and 12 of the Act currently reference two separate Ministers. Subsection (5) of the Act currently requires that the two Ministers each grant their consent for the construction of structures or the removal of objects from the seabed. Section 7 of the Act authorises one Minister, with the consent of the other Minister, to make regulations prohibiting or regulating the discharge of oil, sewage and other harmful substances. Section 12 relates to inquiry powers under the Act that can be exercised by either Minister. Over the years the functions of the two Ministers in respect of these three sections have come to vest with a single Minister, that being the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. However, the section continues to refer to two separate Ministers. In order to address this issue, the proposed amendments combine the references to the two Ministers into one Minister, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The amendments also propose to introduce a new subsection (2A) into section 5 of the Act, requiring that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment consult with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding the safety of an allocation before granting a consent under the section. These amendments will allow my officials, in liaison with the Office of the Attorney General, to proceed with setting legislative provisions to regulate offshore renewable energy projects and gas storage projects beyond the foreshore by way of the issue of consents under the 1968 Act. Amendment No. 1 amends the Long Title of the Bill to reflect that the Bill includes provisions in respect of the Minimata Convention on Mercury and the Continental Shelf Act 1968.

In the schedule to the Minerals Development Act 1940, dolomite and dolomitic limestone were listed as substances to be regarded as minerals within the meaning of the Act. When developing the general scheme of the Bill, it was felt that this reference required clarification and consideration was given as to how best to define dolomitic limestone. This is quite a difficult technical proposition and the formula that appears in the definition of "minerals" in section 2 of the Bill was arrived at following discussion and consultation. In the Seanad debate on the Bill, Senators raised several concerns regarding the practical application of the definition of "dolomite" and "dolomitic limestone". In addition, on Second Stage in the Dáil, several Deputies reiterated these concerns. My officials have advised me that the practical difficulties associated with establishing whether a deposit contains dolomitic limestone are such that it would be best to remove dolomitic limestone from the list of substances that are regarded as minerals for the purposes of the Bill. In respect of the mineral dolomite, I am advised that this does not present the same technical difficulties and there is no reason why this substance, which is of higher-end value than ordinary limestone, should not continue to be regarded as a mineral under the Bill.

Amendments Nos. 8 and 11 are proposed in the interests of consistency and clarity. These amendments will result in the alignment of text in section 9(1)(b) and section 34(1)(b) relating to the extraction of drill cores from land by the Minister in the case of section 9 and by the licensee in the case of section 34. In each case, prior approval of the landowner must be obtained and, where the landowner cannot be found, the permission of the occupier of the land must be sought. Amendments Nos. 12 and 25 replace "is convicted of an offence" with "commits an offence" in sections 36 and 81, that is, a person renders themselves liable to a fine as a result of committing an offence and not on being convicted of an offence. Amendment No. 43 is a correction of a minor error in the wording of section 198(2)(b)(iii) where the word "licence", which should follow the word "mining", has been inadvertently omitted. Amendment No. 44 amends section 200(1), which clarifies that the Minister may bring summary proceedings for offences prescribed under sections 32(5), 33(4), 36(4), 191(4) and the proposed sections 227 and 228.

However, both the application and the existing licence must relate to different minerals. The existing licensee whose interest is in, for example, minerals A and B has, in effect, a standing statement of interest over other minerals in the area of his or her licence. In the event that a new and different applicant applies for, for example, minerals C and D, the sitting licensee is entitled to be notified of the new application and afforded the opportunity to submit a competing application within a specified period. However, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, it is not considered appropriate that the identity of the minerals applied for by the new applicant be revealed to the existing licensee. Amendment No. 9 corrects an error in the existing text that would have required the Minister to notify the existing licensee of the additional minerals applied for in the new application.

Compliance with the directives will be a condition of both the prospecting and retention licence. In accordance with custom and practice, any directives issued under this section would be reviewed at regular intervals to ensure they remain relevant. The Department currently issues guidelines for good environmental practice in respect of mineral exploration activities. On Report Stage in the Dáil, Deputy Stanley proposed that environmental practice directives should be reviewed by the Minister at least every five years. This amendment was accepted.

JVAs are commercial arrangements between licensees and the other potential investors to allow access to further funds for exploration. Typically, the incoming joint venture partner earns in by funding or by undertaking further exploration and if the project continues, they will be assigned a portion of the licensee's rights and obligations. It has always been the policy to encourage JVAs in efforts to maximise the potential for further discoveries. However, nothing in any such agreement can supersede or supplant the Minister's right to reduce the liabilities of the licensee. Nevertheless, it is considered appropriate that the Minister should be aware of the agreement in advance and that officials will be able to advise the licensee on provisions in the agreement that may present difficulties in the future. As originally drafted, the section did not allow for advance scrutiny of JVAs. Unless the joint venture results in an assignment which can only take place with the written consent of the Minister under seal, the licensee will continue to be responsible for all obligations under the licence notwithstanding any other agreement entered into by the licensee with third parties.

Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 to section 75 make it clear that the mining licence fee payable per annum through the life of the licence will also include an element that is payable on grant of the licence. Payment of this portion of the fee is a condition of granting the licence under section 64. Amendment No. 24 to section 80(1) clarifies that the obligation on the licensee to provide information, such as production figures, is not only necessary to calculate royalties payable but also to calculate mining licence fees. Amendments Nos. 20 and 22 were proposed by Deputy Stanley on Report Stage in the Dáil. They amend sections 75 and 76, respectively, to ensure that regulations establishing mining licence fees and royalty rates are reviewed every five years.

The section provided that where the tonnage or value of State-owned minerals in a location is small, and where it is more efficient to do so, that rather than granting a mining licence, the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may sell such minerals, these minerals becoming excepted minerals, that is, that the Minister would not have the exclusive right to work them. The provision was originally intended as enabling the efficient development of small-scale State-owned mineral deposits. On Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad, Senator Ó Clochartaigh opposed section 82 on the grounds that he did not wish to see privatisation of State mineral assets, no matter how small. He considered that it would be better for such minerals to vest in the Minister and for a mining licence to be required for their development. On Report Stage in the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, accepted an opposition amendment to delete section 82. However, for procedural reasons in the Seanad, the amendment fell. This amendment now effects the deletion of section 82.

It empowers the Minister to designate an area as a rehabilitation area, allows for adoption of a rehabilitation plan and for persons other than the Minister to exercise the functions of a rehabilitation authority. Section 135 permits the Minister to delegate the functions of the rehabilitation authority to a person, a local authority or the EPA under such terms he or she considers appropriate. Since the Bill was published, responsibility for the EPA has transferred to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and, therefore, the requirement under section 135(2) for the Minister to seek the written agreement of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government before authorising the EPA to act as a rehabilitation authority is no longer appropriate. Amendment No. 34 reflects this transfer of functions. Section 135(3) requires the rehabilitation authority to indemnify the Minister and the State in respect of the exercise of its functions as a rehabilitation authority. Amendment No. 36 amends section 135(3) to exclude local authorities and the EPA from the obligation to indemnify the Minister and the State as they are emanations of the State.

Where any activity is permitted that may have a significant effect on the environment, the public has a right of participation in, and ease of access to justice to review, decisions. This would normally be addressed through the planning process but where planning is not applicable, the Minister is subject to the obligations under the convention in respect of any relevant decisions. General provision is made for this in sections 203 to 206, inclusive. These sections are intended to apply the same obligations where a person or body other than the Minister, that is, a person authorised under section 135, prepares, revises or adopts a rehabilitation plan. The Attorney General has advised that section 137 is no longer considered necessary and may be deleted. Environmental impacts in respect of rehabilitation plans will be dealt with through the planning process. Amendments Nos. 37 to 39, inclusive, effect this. Amendment No. 46 is a technical amendment which has been recommended by the Office of the Attorney General regarding compliance with the Aarhus Convention in respect of public participation in activities that may have a significant effect on the environment. This amendment sets out the criteria which must be considered by the Minister in respect of exploration activities to determine whether an activity may have a significant effect on the environment, and thus whether article 6 of the convention in respect of public participation shall apply.

The new section deletes all wording after "subsection (4)" and this means information relevant to the proposed decision in regard to taking account of the public interest is no longer defined. We have a concern about that. With regard to amendment No. 39, which deletes lines and inserts a new subsection, the new section removes the phrase "take due account of the outcome of the public participation in its decision" and replaces it with "take due account of the outcome of the public participation in its preparation or, as the case may be, revision, of the rehabilitation plan". We are of the view that the original wording is stronger.

Under existing minerals legislation, state mining leases require the lessee to fully work minerals under their lease terms. The modern mines at Navan, Lisheen and Galmoy have been better equipped to extract full mineral potential of the mine material than older mine sites. There is some industry interest in re-working of mine waste at legacy mine sites. However, this is at an early stage and will be driven by the economic potential. In 2015, the Geological Survey Ireland commissioned a short call project entitled An Economic Assessment of Irish Mining Waste, which was undertaken by Aurum Exploration Services. The project aimed to analyse samples from mine waste sites across Ireland.Of the nine sites sampled, Avoca returned the most positive results, particularly the spoil heaps. The study recommended further analysis of waste dumped at Avoca. Unfortunately, the majority of historical mine sites sampled were reported to have no economic value. The provisions of the Bill facilitate the potential re-use of abandoned mines and associated waste. The definition of "minerals" in section 2 includes all substances, including scheduled minerals that occur naturally in or on land or that occur in extractive waste. However, Deputy Lawless's amendment identified an omission in the Bill as published - the important role of the Minister in promoting sectoral research and innovation. While the Department has commissioned research, such as the Indecon report, and it has facilitated research activities by the Irish Centre for Research in Applied Geosciences, iCRAG, on an administrative basis, it is important that this role is formalised within the Bill. The amendment also identifies two new focuses for research: research into recycling, re-using the reclaiming of extractive waste where this is environmentally sound, thus supporting the concept of the circular economy; and research that may create opportunities where re-use of mine waste could contribute to the rehabilitation of a legacy mine site. As a consequence, the amendment was accepted.

The statement sets out the Government's economic and fiscal strategy over the short and medium term. This strategy revolves around six key pillars: ensuring sound and sustainable public finances; managing public expenditure to ensure maximum return on taxpayers' resources; targeted increases in public investment; reforming the tax system to ensure it is growth-friendly; ensuring inclusive growth and facilitating access to finance, especially for small and medium enterprises, SMEs. On economic developments, the economic outlook in the statement is as set out in the stability programme update. Last Friday, the Central Statistics Office published the outturn data for 2016 and preliminary data for the first quarter of this year, which confirmed the Irish economy continues to perform strongly, with growth of 5.1% recorded last year, the highest in the EU for the third consecutive year. The latest data also provide clear evidence of continued momentum in the economy this year, with annual gross domestic product, GDP, growth of 6.1% recorded in the first quarter. The Department of Finance is forecasting GDP growth of 4.3% this year and 3.7% next year. From 2019 onwards, GDP is expected to grow broadly in line with the potential growth rate of the economy, with positive contributions from both exports and domestic demand. In this context, I should highlight that GDP is clearly overstated as a measure of living standards in the case of the Irish economy. Last week, the CSO published an alternative measure of the size of the economy, so-called modified gross national income, GNI*, which is estimated at €189.2 billion, far lower than the GDP figure of €275.6 billion. This new indicator will help us in our formulation of appropriate policies by giving us a better understanding of what is happening on the ground. It also confirms that economic expansion has been very strong in recent years. Economic growth is a means to an end and not an end in itself. It enables us to pursue our goals of advancing social progress, promoting inclusivity and providing high quality public services. The labour market remains the best barometer of economic trends. Encouragingly, we have had 18 successive quarters of employment growth, representing an increase of over 230,000 jobs since the low point of the crisis. The latest data show that the pace of expansion in employment picked up to 3.5% year on year in the first quarter of 2017, representing the addition of almost 69,000 jobs. The number of people in employment has exceeded the 2 million mark since the second quarter of 2016 and is now at its highest level since the end of 2008. Crucially, the improvement in employment is more balanced than before, with increases in a number of sectors rather than being concentrated in construction, as happened previously. In parallel, the unemployment rate fell to 6.3% in June, down from a peak of over 15% in early 2012. The return to positive net migration last year for the first time since 2009 is another clear sign of the positive momentum in the labour market. This progress is expected to continue. The Department of Finance projects that an additional 55,000 jobs will be created this year, while the unemployment rate is expected to fall below 6% by year end. Over the medium term, employment growth is expected to remain robust and on this basis, by the end of this decade there will be more people at work in Ireland than ever before. In this context, it is important that the budgetary policy mistakes of the past are not repeated and that a counter-cyclical policy is pursued so as to not contribute to overheating the economy. The Government is acutely aware of this. In terms of fiscal policy, recent developments show that the public finances are continuing to move in the right direction. Following a slightly disappointing performance in the first quarter of 2017, tax receipts in the second quarter have stabilised and have been much more robust, with cumulative receipts to the end of June coming in broadly in line with target at just 0.5% below profile. This represents a robust year-on-year increase of 4%. As a result of the strong performance in the second quarter, we are now well positioned to achieve the overall annual tax target of €50.6 billion for 2017, which would be the highest in the State’s history. The pre-crisis period saw very large increases in expenditure. While these increases helped address key infrastructure deficits and provided the resources for significant improvements in public services and social supports, they were ultimately unsustainable. A very painful period of consolidation was required to repair the public finances. Over the last three years, budgetary policy on expenditure has focused on prudent and sustainable increases in expenditure, averaging 3% per annum, below nominal growth in the economy. These increases have allowed additional resources to be directed towards key Government priorities, including in health, housing, social protection and child care. Over the medium term, we will look to continue with moderate and sustainable growth in expenditure to deliver improvements in our public services and infrastructure on a prioritised basis. This approach will help ensure that we avoid the need for sharp fiscal retrenchments in the future, which can be highly disruptive and damaging to our social and economic fabric. Turning to the fiscal outlook, a general government deficit of 0.4% of GDP is projected for this year - unchanged from budget 2017. In addition, it is important to point out that the fiscal objective is to balance the books, that is, to achieve a structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP. I am pleased to point out that we are on course to achieve this medium-term budgetary objective, MTO, next year, which is a remarkable achievement given where the public finances were almost a decade ago. The mistakes of the past will not be repeated. Increases in public expenditure will be sustainably financed and not reliant on cyclical revenues. The fiscal rules are designed to ensure that fiscal policy enhances economic growth and macroeconomic stability and this is something which should be welcomed. The Government recognises the emerging capacity constraints and is also cognisant of the need for budgetary policy not to contribute to overheating the economy. In this context, the limited resources that are available will be prioritised towards those areas where needs are greatest. In future, we need to focus on the fiscal stance and not just the fiscal space. In other words, we need to make sure that budgetary policy is appropriate in supporting sound macroeconomic conditions. Ireland’s general government debt to GDP ratio, having peaked at just under 120% in 2012 and 2013, has fallen rapidly in recent years and is now estimated at 72.8% last year. This is below the euro area average and is set to reach the 60% of GDP target mandated by the Stability and Growth Pact in 2022. While the gross government debt ratio has fallen considerably in recent years, this arises from distortions in our GDP data. Last week the CSO published an alternative measure of the size of the Irish economy, the GNI*, which adjusts for these distortions. This new measure is used to scale our debt. The debt ratio was 106% last year. This is why it is important to focus on continuing to reduce public debt and that is why careful and sensible management of the public finances is needed. The Government will continue to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio until the 60% target legal threshold is achieved and, thereafter, will work towards reducing the ratio to 55% of GDP ratio. Once the major capital projects have been completed the Government will target a further reduction in the debt ratio to 45% of GDP. The Government will maintain a rainy day fund with our annual contribution of €500 million, beginning in 2019. This will be the year following our achievement of our medium-term objective. This is half the size of the contribution originally envisaged, reflecting the need to address emerging capacity constraints. Additional allocations, however, will only be made with due regard for the capacity of the economy to absorb the additional funding. I shall now turn to the fiscal space. The summer economic statement sets out that net fiscal space over the period 2017 to 2021 is €11.2 billion. I want to emphasise that the net fiscal space is the amount that remains after providing for pre-committed policies. This means that overall public spending will be around €60 billion next year. It is important to note that the focus shifts towards the totality of expenditure and not just incremental changes. This is what the Taoiseach was referring to when he discussed the hidden fiscal space. It is important that the fruits of the economic recovery are felt as widely as possible. Fairness matters to the Government. I believe we would all agree that a properly functioning housing market is integral to our economic and social well-being. With this in mind the Government is reviewing its housing strategy to address this. From my own perspective, the affordability matter will also be looked at in this review. While the latest economic data all point to an economy with considerable momentum, a continuation of robust growth cannot be taken for granted in light of the significant challenges facing the Irish economy. Principal among these challenges is the UK’s exit from the European Union, the uncertainty associated with the policy stance in the US and rising protectionist sentiment internationally. With the magnitude of the external risks we face, we must bear in mind that domestically we also face a number of challenges. As a small and open economy, the best way to improve the resilience of the economy to weather inevitable economic shocks is to maintain an appropriate fiscal stance and pursue competitiveness oriented policies. That is what the summer economic statement sets out and what the Government will continue to do.

I would not be saying those kinds of things. I am delighted that a former Member of this House and a former member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach is doing so well for himself. It is a good example and long may it continue. I congratulate the Minister of State again. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy for his opening remarks on the summer economic statement for 2018, which estimates a fiscal space for next year of approximately €1.2 billion. After pre-committed measures for 2017 the remaining fiscal space is around €530 million and this is ignoring the new public service pay deal. Although it has yet to be finalised that pay deal is expected to cost approximately €180 million. This will leave a fairly tight restricted fiscal space. The Fianna Fáil confidence and supply agreement with the Government, and with Fine Gael in particular, clearly states that there should be no surprises when it comes to the budget - as is the case with any other issue. With regard to budget 2018, the basis for Fianna Fáil support will be if the budget adheres to the traditions in that confidence and supply agreement. Chief among the conditions is the commitment to the 2:1 ratio in favour of investment in public services over the cutting of taxes. We reiterate that any changes to universal social charge, USC, must be primarily directed to the low and middle-income earners as stipulated in the confidence and supply agreement. There has been a lot of commentary from the Taoiseach and the Government on the future of the USC but it is blatantly clear that its removal, as promised by Fine Gael in the lead up to the last general election would be completely unsustainable given that it would leave a €4 billion black hole in the State's finances. It must also be remembered that the modest changes to USC in last year's budget cost the State €335 million. Fianna Fáil would support any cut to USC as long as it is directed at low and middle-income earners and if it is fiscally sustainable. Despite much commentary on the merger of USC with PRSI the Minister has confirmed that such a change would not be possible for the next budget and that such a change would likely have an impact on the State's finances and its impact must be properly evaluated. We await this evaluation from the tax strategy group. Any change must be sustainable and be directed at low and middle-income earners. These income levels relate to people who have yet to feel the full benefit of the economic recovery outlined in the figures contained in the summer economic statement. This puts substance on the term "a progressive budget". It is because of the risks facing our economy that Fianna Fáil is committed to the establishment of a rainy day fund in 2019. This is also clearly stated in the confidence and supply agreement. The reason for this rainy day fund is to save for the inevitable downturn in the economy in the future and will assist in smoothing spending over that period. In last year's summer economic statement the Government had promised, on paper, the rainy day fund and consultation with the Oireachtas. This has not yet materialised and in recent weeks we have heard disconcerting remarks from the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, on the rainy day fund. We are glad the Government has now committed to this rainy day fund. The Government would like us to believe that it has been leading the way when it comes to capital investment but unfortunately the evidence shows that nothing could be further from the truth. The Government has been hugely lacking in ambition and taking money from the rainy day fund in 2019 onwards and using it for capital investment can hardly be called radical thinking. The Government has neglected alternative sources of funding for capital expenditure and especially around the 10% rule on the use of public private partnerships. It has been indicated that this may be reviewed and such a review would be welcome to allow further investment in our economy in those areas that are needed such as education, health, transport and so on. There are projects that would be ideal for public private partnerships and could also be facilitated using the European Investment Bank. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund has around €3.6 billion invested in the international markets.This funding needs to be reassigned at a quicker rate back to the domestic economy. Fine Gael is not thinking radically or ambitiously enough about capital expenditure. Senator Kieran O'Donnell will probably allude to the M20 because he manages to get it into every speech he delivers, so I will leave that to him. However, I know-----

I will be very surprised if he does not mention the M20 or Limerick, or both, in his contribution. That is not to say I do not listen to him; I always do, and it is usually of benefit to me to do so. The confidence and supply agreement clearly stipulates adherence in full to domestic and EU fiscal rules. In 2016, Ireland fell short of the structural balance rule and only passed the expenditure benchmark because of a once-off conversion of the AIB preference shares. According to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, we are set to break both the structural balance rule and the expenditure benchmark rule in 2017. While sanctions are unlikely, we need to monitor this closely into the future. We cannot continually breach these rules and expect to get away with it. Much work remains to be done on budgetary oversight. I congratulate my former constituency colleague in the Stillorgan electoral area, Deputy Josepha Madigan, on becoming the new Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. In 2016, the fiscal space was revised upwards from €500 million to €1 billion and then, a week before the budget, up to €1.2 billion. It is very hard to formulate fiscally responsible policies based on figures that keep changing. There had been much speculation about the help-to-buy scheme instigated by a previous Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. The current Minister has now suggested the scheme may be dropped. It is clear that house prices have risen significantly and eroded whatever benefit certain people may have derived from the help-to-buy scheme. In fact, it could be argued that the scheme has just put upward pressure on house prices. Fianna Fáil has been clear that the independent impact assessment under way should have been carried out in advance of the introduction of the measure in the first place. At the time, the Minister made comments that were unhelpful, and there was enough confusion in the market without the Minister adding to it. First-time buyers are now wondering whether they should apply and whether the help-to-buy scheme will be continued, so the scheme needs to be examined. Prices are rising very significantly and I am not sure whether the measure, whatever its intention, has been of benefit to consumers generally. In summary, budget 2017 was a move towards a more progressive budget. This was down to commitments that Fianna Fáil fought for and secured in the confidence and supply agreement, most notably the 2:1 ratio in favour of investment over tax cuts. We will continue to work with the Fine Gael Government and others in that Government to ensure that budget 2018 is yet more progressive than those seen in the past. I wish the Minister of State all the very best in his new role. We will be there to support him when he is being fiscally responsible.

That was in the last couple of years of the disastrous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, when it was trying to convince the people that everything was rosy. The House will remember "Keep the recovery going". The fact that we had to wait until the very last days of term for the statement this year shows how at sea this Government is - or perhaps it was seeking the advice of Fianna Fáil before publishing it. Journalists and taxpayers looking for any sort of detailed plan or some scent of policy or vision are left bitterly disappointed. It is pretty clear there is no plan here, just a stalling exercise while the Government tries to come up with a new plan after the last one disintegrated so badly. Does the House remember the plan that presumably is never to be discussed? I refer to the plan to abolish the USC. That was the reckless, populist position Fine Gael ran away with during the election. Fianna Fáil was going to go 90% of the way to abolition. It was never going to happen and it never should have been suggested, and we know that now. However, have the so-called parties of the centre learned nothing? I heard Deputy Paschal Donohoe at the MacGill Summer School say the centre must hold at all costs to maintain and grow the country's economy, which I thought was quite amusing. Now the great scramble for the new ideas begins, and this is probably where Senator Kieran O'Donnell will come in. There must be serious questions being asked in Fine Gael head office about all this. The challenge for Fine Gael is how to dress up a broken promise as something else or how to present a budget that addresses the challenges facing the country when our sovereignty is so limited by the rules to which we signed up to the effect that we can only have €350 million extra to spend. I am sure the Minister of State wants to hear some positive suggestions. He will know that my party is unique in presenting a fully costed alternative budget full of choices. There are some very straightforward choices. By scrapping the help-to-buy scheme the Government will give itself an extra €40 million in spending power. Developers will be €40 million less well off but the damage done by the scheme will be ended. Betting duty remains very low; it does not even cover the horse and greyhound fund, which needs to be topped up from other moneys. These might not be universally popular choices, but our space is limited and choices need to be made. Of course, the biggest choice of all is what to do with the little fiscal space we have. For my party, the answer is clear: spend it, invest it and do not waste it on tax cuts that benefit the wealthiest most of all. We have no problem saying we do not favour net tax cuts. We cannot afford them. We need an honest debate about tax. There is too much focus on the marginal rate, as if we can just compare marginal rates across the EU and fool ourselves into thinking we have high tax burdens. A recent EU report laid out the facts:The overall personal income tax burden in Ireland, as a percentage of GDP, is generally considered relatively low compared to other EU countries, in part due to low contributions to the social security system. A recent OECD report shows that the effective average tax rate for a single earner at the average wage is the second lowest rate among those EU members who are members of the OECD ... and well below the OECD average. While it rises sharply with income, particularly in the case of childless single earners, it remains below the EU21-OECD average across all income levels and different family types.These are the facts. Some influential groups would have us believe that the average Irish worker is somehow more burdened by tax than his or her fellow workers across Europe. This is simply not true. What those arguing for more and more tax cuts are arguing for is American-style low tax rates. However, they never have the courage to tell us that this also means American-style public services. For too long in this country they have got away with pretending their tax-cutting agenda can somehow work alongside European-style public services. There are positives in this statement. The net debt ratio is falling even outside the distortion of last year's growth. The economy is growing, unemployment is falling and bond yields remain low. On a macro level, things have worked out in our favour without a doubt. However, let us consider some of the figures. There were 357 people on hospital trolleys or crammed into wards earlier last week, 2,777 children in emergency accommodation in May 2017 and 91,600 households on local authority housing waiting lists. There were 484,346 people on hospital waiting lists, 51,698 of whom were waiting for over 18 months. The fact is that our economy and our society face massive challenges, from Brexit to US tax plans, but the most immediate threat comes from politicians and political parties that have learned nothing and are leading us down the road to ruin again. The whole story of an economy or a society is told not just through economic statistics. The so-called rainy day fund issue is a red herring. This is not an issue for October's budget. It suits Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to make it one but this is just theatre. It is raining. This year, it is pouring down for thousands of families that are homeless. It is lashing rain for those who have been waiting years for important medical treatment.It is insulting to talk about a rainy day fund while people are being soaked. It is also deeply dishonest. It is not a rainy day fund. If the worst repeats itself and there is a sudden economic downturn, the fund cannot somehow be thrown onto the fire. The rules would still apply. As we know, they are badly designed, but one of the worst features is that when things go badly, they make them worse. If things go south, having a rainy day fund will be of no help. It is not a rainy day fund but merely a way of taking money out of the economy.  The summer economic statement is a statement of confusion which shows that the Government has no idea what it is doing. It is a big idea that has proved completely unworkable and the Government has been falling around looking for a plan. We are stuck in the ideological straitjacket of the fiscal rules, compounded by the right-wing ideological stance of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The Minister has one advantage. Nobody expects him to present a coherent budget with any vision or strategy. The Government has set the bar so low that we can only hope some sense will prevail. The idea of tax cuts should be thrown out; the help-to-buy scheme should be abandoned and extra revenue should be raised in a sustainable way to make the long-term investment necessary. That is what is needed, but no one is holding his or her breath. In rural Ireland we are certainly not holding ours. The investment required in rural Ireland in broadband and infrastructure provision is not going to be made owing to the fiscal space available. When people hear us talk about a rainy day fund, they find it extremely difficult when they cannot access basic services in rural Ireland.  I wish the Minister of State well, but I find the summer economic statement disappointing. There are huge challenges ahead.

He is certainly putting in the work this week in terms of time and quality. I am bemused by some of the debates that take place in this House. I was a Member of the Lower House in September 2008 when the crash occurred. I remember the panic on the night of the guarantee of the Fianna Fáil Government, after which the economy and the finances collapsed. We could not borrow on the open market to the extent that the troika, the moneylenders, had to come in. Unemployment fell through the floor and public investment in all areas virtually disappeared. Within a relatively short time we are virtually at full employment again and seeking to run a balanced budget which anyone running a home wants to do. It is all very well to talk about spending here and there, but, ultimately, if one cannot pay, it is a problem. We could not pay our way from 2008 in managing the public finances. What has increased significantly, however, is the national debt which is now approximately €200 billion which is unsustainable in the long term. Therefore, we have to bring it down. In any economy there is a need for full employment in order to have a balanced budget and investment and from which the taxes flow that enable the Government to provide public services. Public services cannot be provided unless people are paying income tax, corporation tax and the other taxes related to employment. They allow the Government to deal with those who are less well off via social welfare and other payments. That is where fairness comes in.  I always find Sinn Féin's position slightly amusing. It speaks about what should not be done, but it never states what it would do. It does not talk about the wealth tax or the extra income tax rates it would bring in. It is all very well to be the hurler on the ditch, but the party has seven MPs who were elected to represent the citizens of the North at Westminster. However, they are not doing so. That is an abdication of responsibility. The party is, effectively, drawing the Queen's shilling but doing nothing for it. It cannot have it both ways. Everything is choreographed and everybody goes along with the message. These are my views which are borne out by what I have seen.  We have come out of a winter of discontent which began in September 2008. I take from the summer economic statement that we want to have a balanced budget by the end of 2018, that we want to put an extra €500 million into capital projects and €500 million, rather than €1 billion, into a rainy day fund. I agree with this. Our long-term focus has to be on investing in capital infrastructure projects. For me, that is the key. Senator Gerry Horkan has helpfully reminded me of the M20 project.

They include investment in hospitals. We need an extra 90 beds at University Hospital Limerick, for which funds should be made available. In the budget we need to look at those in receipt of the old age pension and other social welfare payment which I believe should be raised. We speak about the amalgamation of USC and PRSI, but that does not take away from the fact that we should be looking at reducing what is being charged. If someone is earning €32,800 a year which works out as €600 a week, he or she will pay at a rate of 49% on every euro earned above that figure, which is punishing for the ordinary working man and woman I represent.  No party has a monopoly of the people it represents. It is my view that I am here to represent everyone. I take exception to the polarisation of politics and someone saying he or she is left-wing and thus has to vote for a left-wing party. In Fine Gael we look to ensure the self-employed can provide jobs and taxes in order that we can look after the less well-off. I want to be able to create an environment in which every unemployed person can find a job. I do not want to see long-term unemployment but positions being created for people. Our system is imperfect. For a long time it has been structured in such a way as to discourage people from moving from long-term unemployment into employment. We need to look at the structural changes needed, which I know are being looked at.  One issue which came up during our debate yesterday on the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill 2017 was that of life policies, in which I know the Minister of State has an interest. There are insurance companies which sold policies to people on the basis that there would be a capital sum to pay their taxes on their death. The people concerned now find that they have contributed far more than the value of their policy. One man who is 93 years old has put €20,000 more into the policy than it is actually worth. That issue needs to be looked at and I hope it will be. There are challenges to be dealt with in the forthcoming budget. We have to reduce the burden on the squeezed middle and families. We have to look at ways to provide for an increase in different areas. We have to make progress on capital projects. The M20 project is very important in Munster, but it is also about having a balanced budget.That is not about polarisation, it is about looking after all sections of society. I abhor this polarisation of the political domain being done by parties at the moment. Sinn Féin is doing it, so is Solidarity, and I take grave exception to it because I am there to represent all.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	299	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It is not about polarisation. When we look at the Summer Economic Statement we need to be clear of the facts and which indicators we choose to prioritise and focus on. I had urged one thing of the previous Minister for Finance, which I had hoped to see more of in this economic statement, and I hope we will in the next. Among the things the Government has focused on in taking stock and in considering key economic and fiscal developments a few things are manifestly missing. These are crucial if we are to be serious about staking financial and fiscal stock. One is the environment. The entire Summer Economic Statement fails to refer to the environment, or the potentially huge externalities and costs associated with it. It does not refer to it as an area where we need to look to for indicators for where we are going. We know that we are moving towards environmental considerations being a huge part of our budget due to impositions from Europe, but there is no reference to it in our taking stock or in our broader indicators of success. That needs to be part of our economic statements. I am not talking about the detail of policy, but the key indicators as to whether we are developing a sustainable economy, with sustainability as a key concern, which we have heard that it is. The indicators of our labour market refer to levels of employment, but what we do not see are indicators and marker points regarding the quality of employment. There may be good information on that but it is not in the report and it should be. My colleagues spoke about the ordinary working man, but in Ireland the median income is €28,500, so the ordinary working man and the average person is not on the higher marginal tax rate, he is on the standard rate and some two thirds of the population are below that higher marginal rate. That is the statistical fact. For the ordinary working woman, the figures are much lower again. The latest figures available are from 2014, we are awaiting figures from the CSO and I hope they will have improved, but then 50% of women were earning €20,000 or less. That is what the figures were in 2014. In 2015, over 16% of Irish workers were in material deprivation, compared to less than 5% in 2007. If we are restoring and bringing employment back to pre-crash levels, we need to bring the quality of employment back and ensure that we do not have workers who are in deprivation. I welcome the fact that a JLC was recently agreed, but it is real concern in the hospitality industry which will be of concern to the Minister of State, who will be lobbied heavily on the VAT rate. The hospitality industry has still not fully engaged with the JLC process but we must ensure that the investment that the State has effectively made through this ongoing tax incentive is distributed to the wider economy through its workers. These are indicators which must be considered to ensure that economic development is genuinely sustainable and balanced. One crucial area which is missing here, and in the statement of the budgetary process, is the commitment to equality and gender proofing of the budget. The commitment is in the programme for partnership Government. I have met with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are looking at this area and developing it. I am not suggesting that nothing is happening, because I know that there are officials in the Department who are looking at this area, but they deserve to see equality and gender equality indicators included as part of this statement. It is imperative that we move forward on that and I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could elaborate on how the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, and Finance plan to work across all Departments to ensure that the commitment to equality and gender-proofing is achieved and how this fits in to the budgetary process, including whether an equality statement will be produced to accompany the budget, as is the case in Scotland. A crucial aspect of equality and gender proofing is that it is not merely about expenditure but also tax. There is a real concern in Ireland over the problem of income inequality, which has been recognised by the OECD and others. The share of gross income going to the top 1% of earners in Ireland has increased from 34% in 2011 to 39% this year. Imagine a household. It would not make sense that if so much of its income went to one person, and that where there was such an imbalance we would not ask more of that person. We need to look at this if we are genuine in our concern about this imbalance. The Minister for Finance has spoken of balance and if he is genuine he needs to look at this imbalance. For 39% of gross income to go to 1% of the population is a grave imbalance and a serious concern. Over half of the increase in total income over the last five years has gone to the top 10% of earners with the bottom 50%, that half of the population earning below €28,500, receiving just 6% of the increase. We need a recovery, but it must be one that is balanced and that reaches out across society. We know that is what makes it sustainable. IMF research conducted in over 100 countries over at 30 year period shows that when the income of the bottom 10% is increased, GDP growth and national development rises; when the income of the top 10% is increased, development slows in the medium term. This is research that the IMF has produced. We know this is good policy. It is not a question of whether one is on the left or right, it is a question of good economics and recognising that even the IMF and the OECD, bodies which previously advised certain approaches be taken, have now changed their views. They all say we need to invest in equality if we want a sustainable future.

I am tired of being told that we are not suggesting things. I am explicitly suggesting to the Minister of State that he examine the 126 separate tax expenditures, including private pension tax relief which research has shown to disproportionately benefit those on top incomes and does not fulfil our pension agenda. The troika memorandum of understanding asked us to change it and no solid argument has been put forward for maintaining it. It is a tax relief which must be looked at. Let us examine all our tax expenditures and ask if they meet all criteria, and even if they are good, ask if they are better than an investment in social infrastructure. What are the benefits for society in the investment in further strengthening our childcare infrastructure versus a tax relief going to very few? We need to weigh these up and put them on the table when the Government is making its evaluations and considerations. Finally, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, of which I am a member, has put forward concrete proposals regarding lone parents and pension equality in Ireland. These are both direct equality and gender equality issues. As part of the gender and equality proofing which the Government has committed to, I urge it to take action on those two issues.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-19 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	302	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him every success in his new role in the Department of Finance. I also thank him for his help and advice to me during his term here in the Seanad between 2011 and 2016, which I very much appreciated. I listened to Senator Conway-Walsh speak about the lack of vision. We set out a clear vision in 2011 which was about bringing down unemployment. We brought that down from 15.1% down to 6.3%. There was a clear vision with clear targets which we exceeded. There are over 225,000 people working now who were not working in 2012. We had a net outflow of people from the country.People were leaving because the jobs were not here. There will be a net inflow into the country this year. This is because people see this country as a good country in which to live and work. I recently spoke to someone from Poland who is working in Ireland. While the cost of living in their own country is far lower, the wages they would receive would also be far lower to the extent that it would be quite difficult for them to live in their own country on the kind of earnings they would get. We face a number of major challenges but we have a clear vision about where we are going. Areas we need to work harder on include housing, health and infrastructure development. In looking at infrastructure, some of my priorities would be the Cork-Limerick road. I know Senator Kieran O'Donnell would refer to it as the Limerick-Cork road but to me, it is the Cork-Limerick road. It is very important. The north ring road on the northern side of Cork city is another area where infrastructure that is hugely lacking needs to be put in place. If we are talking about development outside Dublin, we need to focus on places on places like Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and other major centres outside Dublin. To do that, we need infrastructure. An issue relating to Cork on which I must focus involves hospital facilities. I have already outlined here the need for capital expenditure in that area in Cork. There has been a population increase of 130,000 people over the past 30 years between city and county. This is nearly the same figure as the entire population of Kerry. Not one additional hospital bed has been opened during those 30 years. We need to prioritise that. It is not just about Cork. It is also about making sure some of the medical services are developed outside Dublin. Sub-specialisation is now taking in place in health services. We need to make sure it is not all focused in Dublin. We need a centre of excellence for Munster where major areas of health can be developed as well. That is very important in respect of infrastructure. In respect of the capital programme, we need to make sure we are putting it into something like a new hospital facility because even if we start in the morning, it will still take a minimum of five years to get it there. We need to start dealing with that issue. I have spoken about the positive side but one thing I am bit concerned about is the fact the figures relating to health in the summer economic statement are distorted. We have gone from 97,003 people working in the health service to more than 108,000. The statement says that 10,000 or 90% are front-line staff. That is not true. I have identified that more than 2,000 additional people are working in administration and management in the HSE in the past two years. I had to extract that figure. Trying to get the information was like pulling teeth. The HSE tried to camouflage the figures. The number of directors has gone from 201 to 289. Those are the most senior positions in the HSE. That is an increase of 43.5%. If we look at the number of doctors, which is in the statement, we can see that it has gone up 1,436, but that was to deal with the working time directive. We need to look seriously at this issue. Services have been improved but we have a lot more work to do and we must not let it run like a rudderless ship, which it seems to be in some areas. It is a major issue that we now need to tackle in addition to infrastructure development and hospital care. The last hospital built in this country was built in 1998. We need to prioritise that area and I ask the Minister of State to take that on board. I also ask him to look at the figures in the summer economic statement. They are a bit distorted and we should take that on board.

I had the pleasure of hearing him discuss a Commencement matter yesterday so he is no stranger to this House. I congratulate him on his achievement in becoming Minister of State. The summer economic statement is a very important statement for the House itself. It gives a good indication of where this State is going and how we are developing. In many ways, it is like a roadmap. Other Senators said we needed a roadmap when we had grave issues in 2008 and 2009. We evolved and changed. We had to because we were literally in a very dark place. We have come out of that dark place. Unemployment has dropped to 6.3%, which is an amazing figure and something we must be proud of. The number of people in employment has increased to more than two million. However, we have problems we need to look at, and how we address them will be key to the development of this nation. We are proposing a new national planning framework in 2040, which is a very important document that will provide a roadmap for the next 20 years or more. We need funding to deliver it but we also need people to deliver it. One of the key issues we face is the lack of people to fill vacancies. We have spoken about the labour market. Unfortunately, the skilled tradesmen who are required to ensure we can build our way out of this housing crisis are not there. Ensuring we have enough skilled labour to keep the economy going will be the challenge of the next decade. It is amazing how the unemployment rate can go from 16.2% to 6.3% and we are approaching the 4% rate that is considered to be full employment. How we deal with it will be a challenge for the nation. We have seen an injection of €500 million into capital projects. There are many areas that many Senators have spoken about, but the rural side of things can never be forgotten. Yes, we need huge infrastructural investment in hospitals and schools, but if we are to rebalance Ireland, infrastructural projects in rural towns and villages must be prioritised. I am talking about areas like Bandon which is a thriving town that is gateway to west Cork but which needs a relief road in order that it can develop. Projects like that need to be prioritised in plans. If we do not prioritise areas like Bandon, we will not have the development we want in rural Ireland because if we open up Bandon, we open up west Cork. When we look at plans, particularly the national planning framework or the review that has been proposed, we need to ensure these are prioritised. They are very important. The initial statement by the Minister of State is very positive and I wish him well. I hope he will deliver on the promise that we can have better rural development.

I know he will carry on his duties with excellence. I am delighted he has been made Minister of State and I wish him and his family every success. He is following in the footsteps of his father, which is another great honour. Fine Gael has a vision for our country of reducing unemployment and ensuring it is the best small country in the world in which to do business. It is one in which we are a fair and compassionate society with a thriving economy that is inclusive of all parts and all peoples and where we can ensure the fruits of a growing economy are spread equitably and fairly among all sides. This summer economic statement is very important because it is about ensuring we protect and sustain our economic growth which is important to our people and which is about ensuring there is a balance between a reduction in taxation and an improvement in services. While we have challenges in housing, health and infrastructure, that is why we have the action plans for education and jobs, Rebuilding Ireland and multi-annual funding for the construction and provision of social housing. Many of my colleagues mentioned infrastructure and as a person from Cork city, I find it very important that Senators Colm Burke and Kieran O'Donnell stated that the Cork to Limerick motorway, the M20, should be prioritised and expedited. As we speak, the vision of the Fine Gael Party in Government, the new and refurbished Páirc Uí Chaoimh, has been reopened and there is a celebration with the first match being played there tonight. It is a tribute not just of the men and women of Cumann Lúthcleas Gael but of the last Government, which was willing to invest in a stadium that could be part of a rugby world cup bid and the vital infrastructure of the sports capital for our country. I pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the former Tánaiste, former Deputy Eamon Gilmore, on their vision in support of that facility. Tonight, in my city of Cork, we are celebrating the opening of a new stadium. I have not heard anybody complimenting it but, of course, we were told we have no vision in Fine Gael. Senator Burke also correctly stated the need to invest in the provision of hospital facilities. I know we have the national children's hospital coming on stream but Senator Burke is right. We have not invested in new health facilities but we need to do so. In particular, in Cork city there is a crying need for the opening of a new and modern hospital. The former Ministers - Senator Reilly and the current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar - saw a project chaired by Mr. Michael O'Flynn and we have seen an analysis that indicates a need for investment in a new health care facility in Cork city. Equally, the convention centre will be important for Cork and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has given capital funding for that. That will be another ask of the Government. My final point on infrastructure refers to the M28 and the lack of understanding from An Bord Pleanála. This is not linked to the economic statement but there has been a lack of meaningful engagement from An Bord Pleanála with the residents of Rochestown and the lower harbour, who wish to have their views taken on board. We are all for that infrastructure but the process must be done in a meaningful way. The ship of State has been turned around with courage and leadership, both from the Irish people and us in the Fine Gael Party. We cannot allow the polarisation of our country to take hold. The centre must hold in politics. That means responsible, meaningful and tangible results must come from the Government in looking to balance the budget while investing in capital infrastructure along with the rainy day fund. We must ensure jobs are maintained and we protect ourselves from extreme views, which offer very little other than high tax and high spending. Nothing else comes from them. My question to those on the other side of the House who purport to be people of fairness and equality is whether they want to see a wealth tax, an increase in corporation or income tax or do they want to see the people we spoke of tonight - the risk takers, the entrepreneurs, the public servant or private worker not on big money - staying in employment. We must continue to take responsible actions on behalf of our people. I commend the Minister of State on his speech and on the summer economic statement. I look forward to this autumn's budget, where we will see the fruits of this statement come to the homes of so many people who require an increase in home care packages in the disability area, for example. The disability inclusion strategy was launched this week. With investment in better economic times we must prioritise those who need our help most.

I know everything is not perfect but by God we have come a long way since the banking crisis and troika came to town to take over the nation's finances. I wish other Deputies and Senators would take the opportunity to say that as far too often we speak of negatives and what is wrong. Many problems have been remedied or are in the process of being remedied. I served on the finance committee with Senator Conway-Walsh and I consider her to be somebody of intelligence and ability. I find it disappointing she trots out the same Sinn Féin stuff that comes from so many others. She states the marginal tax rate is not a big issue but she should make no mistake that it is. The higher tax rate comes in at €33,800. That can be put into context. This is one of the few jurisdictions anywhere that a person hits the higher tax rate before reaching the average industrial wage. I meet representatives of companies seeking to relocate here and their first issue is not the percentage rate of marginal tax but rather how quickly our jurisdiction hits it. We are the third or fourth earliest of the OECD countries in hitting the marginal rate. I want people to be able to earn more and pay less tax. They can then spend money how they see fit. That will generate more income and lead to more employment. It is the real benefit to the economy. The big change between the 2007 Administration and the 2011 Administration was the inability to keep making cuts. For the 2011 Government, others were in charge and it had no choices. The reality must be dealt with. I read today a definition of an ideologue; when ideology comes into conflict with reality, an ideologue will always choose ideology rather than reality. We have been getting people back into work and everything is based on that. There are 2 million people working in the State and I have never heard Sinn Féin stating that is quite an achievement in a short spell. I have never heard Sinn Féin state that 36% of the people working in this State pay zero tax. I support the idea that people in low pay would pay low taxes. Many of those people are part-time workers and can only work part-time.

The individual does not earn the money to pay the VAT. It is the State's money. It is the tax taken from somebody else that is used to keep people out of poverty, and I absolutely and fully support that. The reality is some people pay no tax in the State. I will put it on the record. We have figures from the Irish Tax Institute. The quantity of tax from somebody earning €35,000 - barely on the marginal rate - is 12.5 times the tax of somebody paid €18,000, although that person only earns twice as much. We can push up those figures a little more. Workers on €75,000 will pay 51 times the quantity of tax of somebody on €18,000. There is a line that gets around this jurisdiction that people who are working and paying higher rates of tax are paying practically nothing but they are paying a huge quantity. In the State, 10% of people working earn over €100,000 and they pay 52% on everything over €33,800. They pay a lot of tax. We have taken 400,000 people from the universal social charge net. When the Fine Gael-Labour Government came to power, the universal social charge came into effect at €3,000 but the threshold is now €13,000. We have done everything we can to reduce the burden of taxation on the lower-paid.Now, however, we need to allow people who are in the middle range of taxation to earn more money, pay less tax and choose to spend it as they see fit. A couple of other points are important. Senator Conway-Walsh and her colleague in the Lower House referred to the 1,000 people in emergency accommodation. This is not the 1980s when they would have been banged into a little mobile home at the back of a plot. They are in houses. That may not be perfect, but we are doing our best to try to deal with the issue. These are the results of what happens when a nation goes bankrupt and a government of the people elected by the people no longer has the choice to do what it sees fit. People have heard me describing it as the lost decade. Senator Kieran O'Donnell referred to September 2008, which was when the banking emergency happened. We are now discussing budget 2018. We have lost a decade. We are trying to catch up, but one does not catch up overnight. What we have done in repairing the finances and balancing the budget has been remarkable. It is as remarkable as the people who stayed and worked in Ireland during that decade and paid very high taxes. It is those people who should be commended. Regarding the 91,000 people on the housing list, Senator Conway-Walsh did not mention that they were in houses. They might not be in local authority housing, but they are in rented housing and significant moneys go towards what was the rental accommodation scheme and is now the HAP scheme. These citizens are in houses. As a teenager, I canvassed and knocked on doors in my county. I remember the mobile homes and little caravans out the back. I do not want to return to those days. We are a long way from them. In terms of rural Ireland, Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the proposed M20. I will call it "M20" instead of naming a city first. I could end up in trouble between the Senators from Limerick and Cork. That project is important. The capital programme will be reviewed and announced in November after the budget. Senator Buttimer's point about Páirc Uí Chaoimh was also important. Not everywhere will get a large company like Northern Trust in Limerick or Pramerica in Letterkenny. These companies employ 1,300 or 1,400 people, which makes them magnificent employers. There are other ways of improving the regionality of an area. For example, an area can have a Páirc Uí Chaoimh, Lansdowne Road or convention centre. As anyone who has heard me speak about the capital programme knows, I agree that not everything has to be in Dublin. I saw an interesting CSO statistic. Approximately 60% of the population live within 20 km of the sea, which is remarkable. Most of our urban areas are on the coast. The larger urban areas - Drogheda, Bray, Wexford, Waterford, Limerick and Galway - are all on the coast. We must link up our cities better. When I am encouraging a company to invest in Ireland, the first issue that it raises is the standard of our roads, not towards Dublin, but between the other cities - from Waterford to Cork and from Cork to Limerick. Limerick to Galway is pretty much there, but what of from Galway to Sligo? If we really are serious about rural Ireland, we must reduce these deficits. That is to be announced in the capital programme. A great deal of work is under way in that regard and we are improving in many respects. Regarding the labour market, I am pleased that a large percentage of the 230,000 jobs are full time rather than zero-hour contracts. There is a pretence that these are only poor jobs, but they are not. There is more gender equality in the sector for which I have responsibility - financial services - than in many others. I am dealing with female CFOs, CEOs and so on, which is good. I would like to pursue this matter. As to lone parents, the elderly and the social protection budget, let me revert to 2011 when the income tax take was €11.5 billion and the social protection budget was €20 billion. Practically no jurisdiction paid out twice as much in social protection than it brought in in income taxes. People should not ignore that. I wish to touch on a final point. The national debt is €200 billion. As I have told Senator Conway-Walsh previously, approximately €30 billion of that debt is bank related and €45 billion is the pre-crisis national debt. The remainder comprises the deficits that we ran for a decade as a result of the nation being bankrupt and the collapse in our income and cyclical taxes. We have now put ourselves into a space in which we can balance the 2018 budget. Subsequently, we will be able to invest further in health, education and those other sectors that are important for the State's correct development. It is critical that we not decry the considerable good work that we have done. This is a political Chamber, as is the Lower House, but when we have done a great deal well, we should not be afraid to say so.
