            <p eId="para_4">It would be inappropriate for me to discuss the detail of any individual employee. My Department has civilian staff employed at various military installations throughout the country to support the Defence Forces in tasks such as the upkeep and maintenance of military infrastructure and equipment. The grades are spread across a wide spectrum and include craft workers such as electricians, carpenters, plumbers, and welders; specialists, including health care professionals; and technicians and general operatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> All new entrants as civilian employees are subject to vetting and security clearance processes similar to those for Defence Forces' recruits.  Security is kept under review and my officials work closely with the Defence Forces in relation to such matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_6">Many of us were shocked to hear that a man employed as a security officer - not as a craft worker, a plumber or an electrician to which the Minister of State just referred - at Haulbowline by the Department of Defence has been linked to the New IRA and has just been sentenced to serve five years in jail for possession of firearms and ammunition.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">Will the Minister of State indicate if the contract of employment has been terminated? This is not a discussion about an individual as such but about the particular contract and if it has been terminated. If it has not been terminated, why not? Is it the case that the Department of Defence has written to the convicted man in Portlaoise Prison, telling him that he has 15 days in which to make a submission on or objection to his contract being terminated? Will the Minister of State explain how it is even possible that this was considered? How has the person responded and what is the Department's view on his response? Let us be very clear: he was not a craft worker but someone employed in security at the naval base who checked people as they came on and off site. This is very serious. Will the Minister of State tell the House if the contract has been terminated and, if not, why not?</p>

            <p eId="para_8">As I have stated, it would be totally inappropriate for me to discuss the details of any employee, be they a member of the Defence Forces or a civilian staff member of the Department of Defence. The case is widely known and I will not get into the details of the employee. As the Deputy comes from a legal professional background, she knows well and understands the reasons I cannot, either inside or outside the House, get into the details of any civilian employee.</p>

            <p eId="para_9">The Minister of State is well able to throw across the assertion that because I am a legal professional I should understand the reasons I am unable to ask questions in the Chamber, but I am here in my capacity as a Deputy and spokesperson on defence. In this House I am entitled to ask the Minister of State questions to be answered by his Department. Perhaps he might answer this question. When did the individual last carry out a security duty? The Minister of State can answer that question as it has nothing to do with the case in hand. The man pleaded guilty in the Special Criminal Court to possession of a handgun, a sawn-off shotgun and ammunition. He also pleaded guilty to possessing firearms, including a magazine suitable for a 9 mm parabellum pistol, and a double-barrelled sawn-off shotgun. He further admitted to possessing 14 rounds of 9 mm ammunition and eight shotgun cartridges. The Minister of State has acknowledged that the case is well known. He might also be able to answer if he is satisfied with the vetting processes in place for hiring people to fill these positions? As this question is not directly related to the individual concerned, the Minister of State can answer it. Does he believe it might be wiser to have only Defence Forces personnel acting as security at military installations?</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> The European Committee of Social Rights has considered a complaint submitted by EUROMIL, a European umbrella body for military associations, on behalf of PDFORRA, concerning the lack of certain rights for military representative associations in Ireland. In a non-binding ruling the committee concluded that prohibiting military personnel from the right to strike was not in breach of the European Social Charter but that the charter was breached by prohibiting the representative associations from affiliating with a national employee organisation such as the ICTU and in respect of the right to bargain collectively. The Government welcomes the conclusion of the European Committee of Social Rights that the prohibition on the right to strike for members of the Defence Forces is not in violation of the European Social Charter.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> It should be noted that the basis for the complaint pre-dates a number of significant Government initiatives. In relation to collective bargaining, the Permanent Defence Force representative associations participated in the negotiations last year on the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 which were held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. The PDF representative associations were afforded equal standing to other public sector trade unions and representative associations during the negotiations. Both PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, have accepted the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 which provides for increases in pay, ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement, with the focus on the lower paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> It is critically important that the Defence Forces be fully operational at all times. The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service. The Defence Forces have provided valuable support on many occasions for the civil authorities in maintaining vital services. This was seen most recently in the response to the severe weather event.  In that regard, I record my thanks to members of the Defence Forces, Civil Defence volunteers, civil servants and civilian employees for their particular contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> The right to affiliate with the ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective. A key concern is that such an affiliation would carry obligations that would be incompatible with military operations and the roles assigned to the Defence Forces. Members of the Defence Forces have a range of parallel complaint and adjudication mechanisms in law to compensate for the limitations on their access to the normal industrial relations machinery that applies in wider society. They include the redress of wrongs process, a Defence Forces ombudsman and a conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. Since its inception in the early 1990s, the conciliation and arbitration scheme has provided the framework to progress many successful negotiated agreements between Defence Forces management and the PDF representative associations. There have, however, been many changes to the industrial relations landscape in the intervening period. In that regard, I have initiated a fundamental review of the scheme to ensure it will remain efficient and effective for all parties. In January I appointed Mr. Gerard Barry to conduct the review. While the focus of the review will primarily be on the operation of the Permanent Defence Force conciliation and arbitration scheme, I have directed that the review consider the findings of the European Committee of Social Rights and this has been incorporated into its terms of reference. It would not be appropriate at this stage to pre-empt any conclusion arising from the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">The extraordinary efforts made by soldiers during Storm Emma and other storms show the lengths to which members of the Defence Forces are willing to go in the interests of the State, over and above what is expected of many other parts of the public sector. However, they had to fight the State tooth and nail in the case they took to the European Committee of Social Rights. The case was defended by the State and the ruling is a vindication of PDFORRA's decision to take it. The complaint was made under Articles 5 and 6 of the European Social Charter and the Minister of State lost. While he has said the ruling is non-binding, I expect the State to live up to the commitments to which Ireland signed up in the European Social Charter. What steps will the Minister of State take to ensure the full collective bargaining rights, not partial rights, all other trade unions or representative organisations have are given to members of the Defence Forces?</p>

            <p eId="para_27">As I have said, I welcome the findings of the EUROMIL case and made sure they would be part of the conciliation and arbitration scheme review. In the first instance, I will wait until the independent chairperson of the conciliation and arbitration scheme publishes his report. I expect and hope that all the issues in the EUROMIL case will be looked at in terms of the entire scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> I made sure that I did not sit on the findings, and instead acted on them straight away. I could have not included them in the terms of reference, but I included them later in order to act on this issue straight away. I take the findings of the EUROMIL case seriously, and I welcome them. Once the review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme is published by Gerard Barry, I will consider the report.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Obviously, I welcome the Minister of State's review and it is to be hoped it concludes quickly. Does he expect, even at this stage, that legislation might be required given the changes he has implemented in the meantime? We have seen the effects on the families of members of the Defence Forces and personnel when they were not able to enjoy full collective bargaining rights. I also welcome the decision in full and the fact that it stated that the imposition of an absolute prohibition on the right to strike was proportionate. It is important that was found. One of the key findings of the committee was that the complete ban on affiliation with ICTU was unjustified and cut across the charter.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">The Deputy is well aware that on many occasions PDFORRA asked to become an affiliated member, or to take up associate membership, of ICTU. These requests create significant challenges from a governmental and societal perspective. The Deputy understands that. I am willing to ensure that all these issues are taken into account under the conciliation and arbitration scheme review. I will consider the review once it is published. I have asked that PDFORRA, RACO, the Department and the Defence Forces participate fully in the review. We have a once-off opportunity to put in place a conciliation and arbitration scheme which is fit-for-purpose, part of which will involve the findings of the EUROMIL case.</p>

          <speech by="#LisaChambers" eId="spk_21">
            <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_31">I put it to the Minister of State that he is hiding behind the conciliation and arbitration scheme review. I welcome the fact it started in January, but we still have no definite timeline for completion. It serves the Minister of State well to be able to refer back to the report and say that everything is fine until he receives the review. The fact that the case was taken to the European Committee of Social Rights tells him that we have a problem, and that the current system is not working and undermines the rights of members of our Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> The European Committee of Social Rights upheld the entitlement of Irish armed forces to better collective bargaining and negotiating rights. However, it also found that the Government is entitled to restrict the right of military personnel to strike. For my part and that of my party, I wish to be very clear. I welcome both findings. When one talks about the challenges to Government and the societal challenge of those members of the Defence Forces seeking membership of trade unions, it concerns the area of strike action. It is accepted by the representative associations and by most of us in the Chamber that it is not permissible for members of the Defence Forces to go on strike because it is not in the interests of the public. Does the Minister of State accept the findings of the committee, given that he opposed them? Will he respect them and, more importantly, act on them?</p>

            <p eId="para_33">I am not sure if the Deputy read the press release and statement I issued on the conciliation and arbitration scheme. I said from the beginning of the scheme that I expected the report to be published within six months. I am not hiding behind the conciliation and arbitration scheme review. Had I not included the EUROMIL case in the terms of reference, I presume the Deputy would have jumped up and down today and said I should have included it. Now that I have included it, she has said I am hiding behind the conciliation and arbitration scheme review. That is not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> From the minute the findings of the EUROMIL were published, I insisted that they would form part of the conciliation and arbitration scheme review. I hope that PDFORRA, the Department, the Defence Forces and RACO all fully participate in the conciliation and arbitration scheme review, and this case is part of that. I hope the findings of the EUROMIL case will be included in the report from the independent chairperson. I accept the findings of the EUROMIL case.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">I can assure the Minister of State that I will not be jumping up and down to make any point. I am well able to make my point without that kind of carry on.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The committee found that restrictions may not go so far as to suppress entirely the right to organise, such as the blanket prohibition on professional association of a trade union. It also said it had not been established why matters like issues of public safety and national security could not be discussed in the course of national negotiations by Government and military representatives. It found that a complete ban on affiliation was neither necessary nor proportionate, particularly as it deprived the representative associations of an effective means of negotiating. It held that the mere hearing of a party on a predetermined outcome would not satisfy the requirements of the European charter.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> Most importantly, the committee said it could not conclude that the military representative associations were meaningfully consulted on pay during discussions on public sector agreements. What the Minister of State needs to take from that is that actions are required. A review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme is not sufficient. The committee said that representative associations were not properly consulted about pay and that an absolute ban on association is not necessary or proportionate. The Minister of State did not answer my question. Will he respect the findings of the committee and act on them?</p>

            <p eId="para_38">As I said in my original reply, the complaint predates a number of significant Government initiatives over the past 12 months. PDFORRA and RACO were very much part of the public service pay agreement and the negotiations. The EUROMIL case was ongoing while negotiations took place. There have been a number of changes since my appointment. I want representative associations to be at the table and form part of the negotiations, which is only right and proper. They may not be recognised unions but they are representative associations for all members of the Defence Forces. I am happy to say that RACO and PDFORRA subsequently signed up to the public service pay stability programme, which is welcome. I fully accept the findings of the EUROMIL case. I will wait for the outcome of the conciliation and arbitration scheme review to be published to determine the next step.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I am advised that 1,902 personnel left the Permanent Defence Force in the three-year period from 2015 to 2017, inclusive. This includes 459 personnel who did not complete initial training to qualify as three-star privates or officers. Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel. This is not new and the Permanent Defence Force has always had a level of turnover that far exceeds other areas of the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">For example, in the three-year period 2010 to 2012, 1,903 personnel left the PDF. Going back further, 2,282 left in the three-year period 2001 to 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> To balance personnel turnover there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level. During 2017, 751 personnel were inducted into the PDF. This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> Unlike other areas of the public service, and due to the nature of the duties performed, overtime payments are not available to members of the Defence Forces. A military service allowance is paid to all ranks up to the level of colonel. Military service allowance is designed to compensate for the special disadvantages associated with military life. This includes unsocial hours of duty, exposure to danger and the restrictions inherent in military discipline. In addition to basic pay and military service allowance, a range of duties attract additional allowances, including security duty and Naval Service patrol duty. Overseas support allowance is paid to members of the PDF participating in overseas military operations on direction of the Government. Certain positions in the Defence Forces also attract specialist pay, with some 3,554 positions in the PDF establishment attracting technical pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">

            </p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Defence Forces pay is increasing in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement, with the focus of the agreement once again being on the lower paid. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 will also restore pay scales to all public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, earning up to €70,000. The reversal of cuts to allowances will also be considered in the context of the agreement. The first instalment of an increase of 1% on annualised salaries due from 1 January 2018 has been paid to members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> The starting pay for newly qualified three-star privates and their Naval Service equivalents, inclusive of military service allowance, is €27,257 gross annual earnings, with scope for further income from duty allowances. This is a significant increase on the €21,800 per annum which was the amount prior to the implementation of the increases in pay received through recent pay agreements. The starting pay for a corporal, including military service allowance, is in excess of €37,000 per annum. The first point on the pay scale for a sergeant, including military service allowance, is €40,000 per annum. As I have outlined, further increases are due under the pay agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The working family payment, formerly the family income supplement, provides a means to supplement the income of working families, be they employees in the public or private sector. Family income and the number of dependants are the key variables in determining eligibility. Pay levels in the public service, including the Defence Forces, relate to requirements for specific positions and are not determined having regard to unique family circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> I have previously stated that there are difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialists in the PDF. This includes pilots and certain other technical specialists. The Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with examining recruitment and retention challenges in the defence sector in more detail. The Public Service Pay Commission has commenced this work and has requested detailed information from the Department of Defence. Defence management is preparing its submission, which will be sent to the commission in the coming weeks. The Public Service Pay Commission is due to complete this exercise in the second half of 2018. The findings and proposals arising will be considered at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> The capabilities maintained by the Defence Forces are based on detailed consideration of capability requirements and agreed by military authorities. With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">Why are so many members of the Defence Forces on the working family payment, formerly known as the family income supplement? This is a disgrace. Those who serve our country dutifully should not be paid so little that they are forced to take a supplement that, in the Government's own words, gives extra financial support to people on low pay. I will describe to the Minister of State how little those in the Defence Forces are being paid. They make about €420 for 48 hours' work a week, including some weekends. By comparison, the minimum wage is €9.75, and someone on the minimum wage working 48 hours a week would make €468. Many in the Defence Forces make less than the minimum wage. How is this acceptable? Furthermore, unlike gardaí and other public servants, those in the Defence Forces are excluded from the European working time directive, which means they are not eligible for overtime. This means members of the Defence Forces work long hours for little to no pay. It is therefore no surprise that 2,890 soldiers of all ranks have discharged from the Defence Forces in the past three years. The number one reason for leaving is known to be issues with pay and contracts. This turnover rate leads to chaos within the Defence Forces and a lack of structure and consistency needed for a military organisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">Some of the issues the Deputy has raised in what he has just read out form part of what is called "details supplied" in the question he asked. That is okay; I accept that. However, he refers to the high number of members of the Defence Forces on the working family payment. Less than 1% of the total staff of the organisation is on family income supplement - between 100 and 104, according to the latest figures I received in December 2017. The information he has provided under "details supplied" states there are considerable numbers - far higher than the numbers I have given - which is totally inaccurate. The working family payment is there for a reason, as the Deputy has rightly said, namely, to assist hard-pressed families. This depends on how many kids a member of the Defence Forces has. I have not got time to read it out to the Deputy now but I will send him a note on the pay increases that have been put in place for members of the Defence Forces. There will be full pay restoration under the public service stability agreement for anyone earning under €70,000 per annum. I will get the Deputy the full reply to the question on pay restoration. He was good enough to raise the email I received. I will get him a full reply-----</p>

            <p eId="para_70">The Minister of State says there are only so many people on what we will call the family income supplement. No one should have to be on it. People in State jobs in the Defence Forces should earn enough money every week to sustain themselves and their families. They should not have to seek assistance from another arm of the State, namely, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, to allow them to balance their budgets. That is quite simply not acceptable. I am very proud of the work of members of the Defence Forces. The Minister of State knows that when something goes wrong in our country, they are the first people to be called. If there is a problem internationally, if our assistance is sought, we have always been at the forefront. I did not come here to pick a fight with the Minister of State. He might like to pick a fight with me over nothing but I will not rise to that. I ask him to treat these people with the respect they deserve and ensure they have proper remuneration for the excellent work they do. I know in my heart and soul that the Minister of State appreciates their work as well. I urge him to fight at Government level to improve their lot. That is what I am asking him to do in a very ordinary and respectful way, as he would expect me to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">I have been doing that and will continue to do so, but we must abide by the public service pay stability agreement as well, and I think the Deputy understands the reasons we must do so. He stated no one should be in receipt of family income supplement. There are members of the Defence Forces who have particular roles or ranks and have no children, or perhaps one or two kids, and then there are those who do the very same job at the very same rank and who could have five, six or seven children. I believe the State should be there to assist those who might be struggling. This is why the family income supplement exists. There is a myth that more than 1,000 members of the Defence Forces are in receipt of family income supplement. This is untrue and unfounded. There are just 100 to 105 members of the Defence Forces in receipt of family income supplement, 1% of the total organisation. The number of people on family income supplement in the Defence Forces, including members from the Department of Defence, must be considered broadly.</p>

            <p eId="para_73">I am keen to hear the Minister of State's views and plans for the development of military barracks in the greater Dublin area. We have the Baldonnel site, Casement Aerodrome, McKee Barracks on the north side and Cathal Brugha Barracks. Is it possible to improve our military operations and the conditions for the Defence Forces? We could look at the Curragh and other potential sites as well and in the process use the likes of the Cathal Brugha Barracks site instead for cost-rental public housing. The Minister of State will be aware of this because we had a Private Members' Bill in this regard. This would be of huge benefit to tackling the rental crisis gripping our city at present, particularly the south side of Dublin. Has he considered, and will he consider, reorganising our military infrastructure in the Dublin area to help facilitate this and to give the Army better facilities as an outcome of this approach? If not, why not?</p>

            <p eId="para_74">My Department’s focus is the development and improvement of the physical environment and living conditions in existing military facilities to ensure that the Defence Forces have the capability to deliver on all roles assigned by Government. This is achieved through the Defence Forces built infrastructure programme. The programme is designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities of the Defence Forces. It is predicated on operational requirements and is compiled on a priority needs basis by my Department in conjunction with the military authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> The capital element of the programme focuses mainly on infrastructure projects, including the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of facilities. In any one year, the programme provides for new project starts and for the continuation of building projects already under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">Some €35 million worth of projects are currently at various stages of implementation, ranging from design to construction. Some €14.2 million has been provided for the delivery of these projects in 2018. In addition to capital projects, ongoing works are required under the programme to ensure the upkeep and repair of barracks and other military facilities. Approximately €9 million has been provided for these works in 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> To develop a strategic perspective on military infrastructural requirements into the future, the White Paper on Defence identified the need to develop a rolling five-year capital plan that takes account of the capability priority needs of the Defence Forces. This plan, which is based on a comprehensive survey of military infrastructural requirements, has identified potential projects at all the locations referred to by the Deputy in his question. The plan will be finalised in the coming months. It will provide a comprehensive framework for the roll-out of infrastructural developments over the next five years on a priority needs basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> More generally, the White Paper sets out the policy framework for the development of the Defence Forces in the period to 2025. To facilitate this, the 2018-27 national development plan provides for a capital allocation of €541 million for the five-year period to 2022. The national development plan recognises that defence provides part of the societal bedrock which allows society to function and thus contributes to national well-being across political, social, economic and environmental elements. This investment emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring the Defence Forces have the capabilities needed to deliver on all the domestic and overseas roles assigned by the Government as set out in the White Paper.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">There is a chance that the process in which the Minister of State is engaged will look at strategic allocation to and investment in barracks. I think our Defence Forces have lost out and have been short-changed. They did not do well during the difficult period the country went through. More than anyone else, the members of the Defence Forces were affected by pay cuts and under-investment. This can now be seen in a variety of ways. I have been told by people who are close to the ground and have experience of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces that soldiers are now moving all over the country. People are coming down from Finner Camp to do barracks duties at Cathal Brugha Barracks. This involves a huge amount of travelling, which is one of the reasons for the high turnover of people within the Defence Forces. We do not give them enough support and resources. This is an opportunity for the Minister of State and the Defence Forces to modernise. This should not just be about a five-year capital programme involving €30 million or €50 million, as the Minister of State has mentioned, but it should be about thinking big with regard to how best to organise our defence operations in the Dublin area. Some 227 acres are available at Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel, which is not a small site. Lands are also available at McKee Barracks and Cathal Brugha Barracks. Other nearby facilities include those at the Curragh. Will the Minister of State avail of this opportunity to tackle the housing crisis? More than that, in his role as Minister of State with responsibility for defence, he has an opportunity to change the game by investing in our Defence Forces in a way that will give them a really modern and top-of-the-range facility in one of the locations I have mentioned.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">These two very important military installations which are in strategic locations in this city are vital for the Defence Forces. I hope every Member of this House understands why we need military installations at such strategic locations within the city. Projects worth approximately €5 million are at different stages, including design, tender and construction, at Cathal Brugha Barracks at the moment. There are absolutely no plans for the Defence Forces to move out of Cathal Brugha Barracks or McKee Barracks, which are two vital installations. I understand that there are housing needs but I am sure plenty of other vacant public sites across the city can be used for housing purposes. When the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, served as Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, he started to compile a register of all vacant lands owned by the State. I presume there is plenty of land within the greater Dublin area that can be used without having to touch Cathal Brugha Barracks or McKee Barracks at any stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">I am afraid it is not the case that there is plenty of land in the area we are thinking of. I am particularly interested in Cathal Brugha Barracks, which is in my constituency. The area in question is at the heart of the rental crisis. I assure the Minister of State that there are no other lands within the city area. What are the strategic military reasons for needing to have two military bases in the city? What is the strategic military risk that would arise if we had just one such facility? I suggest that if we concentrated on one facility, we could really modernise it by putting in first-class facilities. We could get funding to turn it into a top-of-the-range modern facility. Is it not true, as I have suggested to the Minister of State, that we have ended up with the worst of all worlds as a result of the military organisation we have done? Cathal Brugha Barracks has not been updated and kept up to standard. Soldiers are having to travel from all over the country to operate there. It is not worked in a co-ordinated manner. Is there not an opportunity here to think outside the box in a way that would improve facilities while helping to address the housing crisis, which is something we need to do? While I accept the need for certain security details, such as tracking money out of the Central Bank, I do not see why all three facilities are needed in Dublin city at this time. I suggest that Dublin's strategic military interests could be served from McKee Barracks and Casement Aerodrome, which is a half-hour ride down the road. Having armoured vehicles going through the main streets of Ranelagh and Rathmines is not a clever approach in many ways. What is the strategic reason for needing two facilities in the heart of the city?</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_95">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 47 and 58 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> EU battle groups are designed to give the EU a rapid response capability which can be deployed in support of crisis management or humanitarian operations under the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy and in support of UN-mandated missions. Battle groups are designed to have the capacity to deploy within five to ten days of a Council decision and to be deployed for 30 days, extendible to 120 days. The UN strongly supports the development of EU battle groups as a capability that could be made available in support of UN-mandated missions. It supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities in the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability with like-minded states. Ireland's participation in EU battle groups supports Defence Forces capability development and interoperability and demonstrates Ireland’s commitment to the development of EU crisis management capabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_97"> Ireland's continuing active engagement in EU battle groups enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the EU's rapid response capacity. I refer particularly to the role battle groups can play in reinforcing UN operations. Participation in EU battle groups supports Ireland’s international security and defence policy and enhances our bilateral relations with other contributing member states. Ireland has participated in EU battle groups on a number of occasions, commencing with the Nordic battle group in 2008. Ireland participated in the German battle group in 2012 and 2016. On 6 February last, the Government approved Ireland's participation in the German-led EU battle group 2020, which will be on standby for the second six months of 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> The proposed Defence Forces contribution to the German battle group will involve a special operations task group. The group will comprise a special operations forces platoon - Army ranger wing, engineer specialist search capability, explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, capability, and a security platoon together with staff posts at both the operational and force headquarters. The exact numbers and composition of Ireland's participation remains to be finalised and is a matter of ongoing discussion with battle group partners. The total number of Defence Forces personnel expected to be involved will be approximately 148, which has yet to be decided upon. However, this level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be called on to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate. The battle group will also involve Ireland’s participation in a joint field exercise-manoeuvre training of all the German battle group elements, which is planned to take place in Germany in early 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> The Government decision to participate in the 2020 battle group does not presume any future decision on deploying the Defence Forces on an actual battle group operation. Ireland's participation in an actual battle group operation would, as always, be subject to the usual triple lock requirements of a UN mandate and Government and Dáil approval, as appropriate, in accordance with the Defence Forces Acts. Ireland continues to retain the absolute right to determine for itself, on a case-by-case basis, whether it will participate in any particular battle group operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> Discussions are ongoing on the battle group memorandum of understanding, MOU, which is an agreement between the participants comprising the battle group, namely, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Ireland, Croatia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. This sets out principles regarding the operation, deployment and management of the German-led battle group. While the advice to me is that Dáil approval of the MOU is not required, in the interest of transparency, I have decided to proceed on the basis of a voluntary invocation of the procedure under Article 29 of the Constitution and to seek the approval of Dáil Éireann for the MOU once it is finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">Many Members of the Dáil have been raising the issue of Ireland's participation in EU battle groups for a while now and how our involvement is in accordance with our stated principles of neutrality but the Government's response is to always hide behind intentionally opaque language. Last month, we even had the Taoiseach translating the term "battle group" into the French term "force tactique" and saying that would be a better term to use, presumably because even the term "battle" is too much of an indicator of the purpose of these groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> When the Government talks of any military matters, it is always in terms of peace, security, stability, crisis management and the progress of our forces in the area. While that skewing of the language of war carries on, the arms industry tightens its grip on policymakers in Europe and we trundle on towards the objective of an EU military. Will the Minister of State clarify exactly the type of crisis for which we are preparing? Our involvement in battle groups has seen our troops being trained in the use of armoured personnel carriers armed with 13 mm cannons, grenade launchers and other such advanced weaponry. What application does the Minister of State see for such training in the future?</p>

            <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_104">I am very much supportive of our participation in battle groups. It is worth noting that we participated in Nordic-led battle groups in 2008, 2011 and 2015. We participated with the UK in 2016 and, to date, no battle group has ever been deployed in a military operation. It is worth noting these matters when people start to scaremonger and say the flood gates will open, we are heading into battle and this is an EU army. It is not any of those things. It is about being prepared to deploy our troops on UN-mandated missions in which we will be involved in peacekeeping, peace enforcement, conflict prevention and in providing assistance to humanitarian operations. That is what the Irish Defence Forces do and what we are committed to doing. It is what we have always done and will continue to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_105"> Will the Minister of State confirm to the House if eight to ten persons will be involved? That is what has been reported. I understand that Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia and the Netherlands are also involved. Will the Minister of State confirm to the House if that is his information?</p>

            <p eId="para_107">Just because the Nordic battle group or the UK battle group were not deployed does not mean that the German battle group will not be deployed. It is appropriate it is called a battle group given the history, the way this was starkly outlined recently in a European Commission document on the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and the way it was also quite starkly outlined by Jacques Delors that the intention of those who are at the helm of the EU project is an EU army. Therefore, the term "battle group" is quite appropriate. Will the Minister of State confirm what exactly are the tasks that fall under the peace enforcement task, to which Deputy Chambers referred, that this battle group may take upon itself in the near future?</p>

            <p eId="para_109">I advise Deputies Chambers and Ó Snodaigh that the memorandum of understanding is being prepared and I do not want to give a number until I have the exact number as I do not want to mislead the Dáil in any way. I agree with Deputy Chambers that no battle group in which we have participated has ever been deployed to date. Having spent last week meeting members of our Defence Forces deployed on missions involving the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, UNTSO, and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, they would say that the experience they gained in a battle group with respect to interoperability, working with like-minded nations and so on is extremely important when they are deployed on a UN-mandated mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> Deputy Wallace spoke of the possible missions a battle group could be called upon to participate in, be it crisis management or humanitarian assistance missions. I agree with the Taoiseach when he said that the term "battle group" is quite unfortunate. The Government has been trying to change it and I understand a previous Government led by the party of which Deputy Chambers is a member also tried it change it at European level. People wrongly interpret the term "battle group". It is not that we are going into battle. We are participating in something that will give us capability, experience and interoperability which we cannot get by having our troops in barracks. The experience they get through participating in a battle group is extremely important when they go to participate in UN-mandated missions, common security and defence policy, CSDP, missions or other missions. This is about working with like-minded nations. It is extremely important that our troops have the experience of working with the participants of other countries when they participate with them in missions. Such participation provides the opportunity for our troops to gain the experience of working with like-minded nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> If we are to become full members of the battle group and if we are to be tasked on a mission that the battle group is called to participate in, approval for that will have to come back to the Dáil. It is not that we will participate in such a mission on a nod and wink basis. That would have to come back to the Dáil. Deputy Wallace voted for or against such a proposal previously.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">That vote does not give me any comfort given that the two largest parties in the State are both of a hawkish nature. The Minister of State is saying that the term "battle group" is unfitting. That reminds me a little of PESCO. The Government pretends when it comes to this but the Europeans do not pretend in the same way. They are a bit more open about it. They do not call it a battle group for nothing. If the truth be told, we may end up in a battle situation. The Minister of State cannot guarantee that is not possible. The Europeans admit that. In the same way, PESCO is a far more serious animal than our State wants to acknowledge.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> To keep up with our gung-ho allies, Ireland will have to spend more on military technology. Our defence budget is going to increase and it will not be spent on the wages of the Defence Forces. As for the idea that being involved in a battle group is good for our Defence Forces and prepares them for peacekeeping missions, our Defence Forces already have a very high reputation in peacekeeping without ever going near a battle group. That argument does not hold water.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> We do not think that Ireland should have anything to do with the military affairs of European countries which like to promote the arms industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">It has become a self-sustaining industry. The Minister of State knows that the global military spend this year will be the highest since the start of the Cold War. It is madness.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">Deputy Wallace has said that the Dáil vote would not give him any comfort. What would not give me any comfort is sending our troops out on peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions without having been properly trained or without the experience they need. That is why it is important to participate in battle groups and to engage with other like-minded member states. To give an example of where this has worked very effectively, we worked with the Finns in the Nordic battle group. We then went on to partner with them in Chad and Lebanon. We trained with another member state and another country, worked together and went on to serve on a peacekeeping mission. This is a very clear example of the benefit of working within an EU battle group.</p>
            <p eId="para_119"> We have a triple lock in place. There are no absolutes in this life. We have very clear checks and balances. If ever a battle group is to be deployed, the Dáil must vote first. We will have our say in this House as the democratically elected representatives of this country. That gives me great comfort because it is how our country is run and has always been run. To date, we have only ever participated in UN-mandated missions and the UN fully supports these battle groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">I do not underestimate the ability of the Irish Defence Forces to train their own troops. They have done so for many years and that training has stood the test of being on UN duties around the world. The honourable tradition of the Defence Forces' deployment on those duties is being undermined by the actions of this Government and the previous one in aligning themselves with EU battle groups and the proposals that I believe go towards an EU army, as I have outlined in the past. Does the Minister of State not accept that the title of "battle group" was not unfortunate but was quite deliberate, given what I said earlier about the Commission and those who are at the helm of the EU? They are not daisy pickers. It is a battle group in terms of the idea and the tasks. I ask the Minister of State what tasks exactly are involved such that a battle group can be sent. It is not just about peacekeeping. There is peace enforcement, taking sides, going into battle with an opponent if it is not willing to accept the diktats of the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">The possible missions in which we can participate include crisis management, humanitarian missions and issues surrounding that. Before we actually participate in such a mission, it has to come under the triple lock. It will come back here for Deputy Ó Snodaigh, every other party and every other Member of this House to vote on. That is only right and proper. Deputy Wallace spoke about the two largest parties voting in favour of this. That is democracy. If he had a party of about 100 members who thought like himself, then we would be voting differently. That is the way it is. We have to respect the democracy of the Chamber and the people who participate in an election to return Members here.</p>

When Alan Shatter was Minister for Justice, he claimed that the Garda Síochána had no role in the inspection of foreign state or military aircraft at Shannon or other airports because they enjoy sovereign immunity. In effect, this means the Government allows the US military to take whatever or whoever it wants through Ireland, regardless of the human rights, security and other consequences. I know the Defence Forces are not responsible for inspecting the planes but they are playing a role in facilitating the US use of Shannon Airport as a military base to go on to destroy lives and places in other regions without us giving a damn.</p>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of aid to the civil power, ATCP, which in practice means to assist An Garda Síochána when requested to do so. On each occasion that the support of the Defence Forces is required, An Garda Síochána issues a form C70 to the Defence Forces to request their assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> Since 5 February 2003, the Garda has requested support from the Defence Forces at Shannon Airport on occasion. The cost of the presence of Defence Forces at Shannon Airport performing aid to civil power duties with regard to United States of America military aircraft landing at Shannon Airport in 2017 is €180,579.81 for 293 deployments. For security reasons, it would not be appropriate to disclose the details regarding the number of personnel assigned to each deployment.

            <p eId="para_131">The planes are not being inspected; we do not care what the Americans do in Shannon. Yesterday was the fifteenth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. The role this country has played in facilitating the destruction not just of Iraq but several other countries in the region is an absolute shame. We are still doing so. We should learn some lessons from Iraq and should remember it. Not only do we still owe an enormous debt to the people of Iraq, the war's goals also remain in place, namely, expanding US military domination, controlling oil and pipelines, facilitating US business, promoting the arms industry, and building an empire of military bases. The wars raging across the Middle East today find their origins in the Iraq war. We need to remember that it was Bush's occupation of Iraq that gave rise to ISIS. That terrorist organisation germinated in the cells of prisons in which Iraqis were being held. Is Ireland ever going to learn that America is not going to the Middle East to promote democracy? It has supported dictators there for many years. It is creating untold hardship, destruction and misery.</p>

            <p eId="para_132">The Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána have primary responsibility for the internal security of the State. The Defence Forces are deployed on the basis of aid to the civil power, in practice on the request of An Garda Síochána. Accordingly, any security assessments that the Deputy has mentioned or decisions to seek support from the Defence Forces are matters totally for An Garda Síochána. Members of the Defence Forces assist An Garda Síochána under the provisions of aid to the civil power. I have repeated this in the Chamber on numerous occasions, although the Deputy might not agree with me. In the first instance, the security of the State is the total responsibility of An Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces assist. During the weather crisis, there was an incident in Tallaght when the Defence Forces responded to a request by An Garda Síochána under aid to the civil power.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, said that the Garda had no role in inspecting military aircraft because they have sovereign immunity. The writer, Sinan Antoon, an Iraqi living in New York, said this week that the invasion of Iraq is often spoken of in the United States as a blunder or even a colossal mistake but that it was a crime and those who perpetrated it are still at large.</p>
            <p eId="para_134"> Fianna Fáil and the former Progress Democrats, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, Fine Gael and the Labour Party and, now, Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance have facilitated the US using Shannon as a military base to create unbelievable destruction and hardship. More than 1 million civilians who were not involved in any armed struggle have been killed by the Americans and Ireland was party to it. It is a bit like carrying the murderer to the scene where the killing takes place. In allowing Shannon to be used for military purposes we are facilitating a crime. We need a rethink on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_139">I am advised that Tafenoquine is being developed for the prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax malaria and is currently not available in Ireland. As I have indicated to the House in the past, fundamentally the choice of medications for use in the Defence Forces is a medical matter that should be decided by qualified medical professionals. In the Defence Forces, these are decisions for highly qualified medical officers having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. I have been advised by the military authorities that currently the Defence Forces has no plans to include Tafenoquine in its formulary of medication.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">I am not a medical expert and I cannot make findings in regard to new or previously used drugs, but I have seen the affects of a drug that was previously deemed fit for purpose but has had devastating affects in defence forces across the world, namely, Lariam, or mefloquine as it is medically known, which it is now proposed to replace with a sister drug, Tafenoquine. I am asking that at the very least an instruction be given that this drug be tested for prolonged use in military circumstances. We know only too well the detrimental effect that the use of Lariam has had not only on Irish soldiers but on others in larger military organisations around the world which no longer prescribe Lariam. Before we go down the road of even looking at any new drug, we should look at the experiences of larger defence forces.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">On the Deputy's point regarding the withdrawal from sale in Ireland of Lariam by Roche Products, I understand that decision was based on a commercial assessment. As Minister with responsibility for defence, my first priority is to ensure that Irish personnel deployed to missions where malarial issues arise are given the best medication possible, and in this regard I am dependent on the advice of medical personnel. The advice I have been given on this occasion is that they are supportive of the medication that is currently being prescribed. </p>

            <p eId="para_142">We have massive problems in this country arising out of the prescription of Lariam. Even with international evidence mounting, the withdrawal of the drug from the market for ordinary consumers, the admission of the UK armed forces that they made a mistake in prescribing it and that it has caused serious harm to soldiers, we still have not made any moves to address the issue. That is remarkable. The issue has been raised many times in this Chamber, including by others before this Dáil was constituted. Why are we are ignoring the evidence that people's health is being severely harmed by this particular drug and why is it not the drug of last resort? There is always an argument for retaining it lest nothing else works, but something needs to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">There is a Dáil motion which instructs the Government to end the use of Lariam. In withdrawing the sale of Lariam from the Irish market, Roche Products (Ireland) Limited has taken that decision for the Government. I do not foresee the Defence Forces trying to source Lariam on the black market when soldiers are being sent abroad. My question is in regard to Tafenoquine which is being touted around the world as a replacement for Lariam. According to the experts in medicine, medicines ending in "quine" are not suitable for prolonged use. We are not medical experts but we can make findings based on the evidence presented to us, not only in this House but from inquiries in Canada, England, Australia and the United States. I ask the Minister of State to heed those findings, please.</p>

            <p eId="para_145">I thank the Deputies for their questions. In response to Deputy Wallace's question, I have not taken Lariam.

            <p eId="para_155">I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 42 and 53 togther.</p>
            <p eId="para_156"> The Naval Service continues to fulfil all roles assigned by Government and, on a day-to-day basis, undertakes a broad range of tasks, including fishery protection, security operations, diving operations and other supports. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently approved the deployment of Naval Service personnel and assets in support of Operation Sophia. The establishment of the Naval Service is 1,094 and, as of 31 January 2018, the strength of the Naval Service is 1,051. The military authorities have informed me that the Naval Service was administering 17 applications for discharge in January 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_157"> The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. The White Paper on defence recognises that continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces, providing young, motivated and enthusiastic personnel to replenish military formations for operational deployments. In this context, there is significant ongoing recruitment to the Permanent Defence Forces and this is a long-term trend. Recruitment plans have been developed to address vacancies in the establishment and also to replace personnel who have exited the Defence Forces. There is also an ongoing programme of human resources development within defence organisations, part of which is aimed at ensuring that there is an appropriate work-life balance. The Chief of Staff is actively addressing matters to this end and I have initiated a review of the criteria governing contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_158"> There have been significant improvements in pay for members of the Defence Forces under the Lansdowne Road agreement, with the focus of increases being on the lower paid. Both PDFORRA and RACO have signed up to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 which provides for further pay increase of between 6.2% and 7.4% over its lifetime. Under my direction, the Department of Defence has previously brought issues relating to recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force to the attention of the Public Service Pay Commission. The commission is further examining these issues in its next tranche of work. A departmental civil-military submission is currently being prepared and I am aware that the representative associations have also been requested to make submissions by the commission. I will continue to work closely with my Government colleagues and civil and military management to ensure that the Defence Forces can continue to deliver the capabilities required to discharge all roles assigned by Government.</p>

            <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_159">At the end of last month, a newspaper report claimed that in January 2018 more than 30 members of the Naval Service had asked to apply for discharge. The situation was described as "unprecedented" and "worrying" by PDFORRA. Concerns have been expressed at the wealth of experience being lost at one end of the scale and at the number of younger personnel who are jumping ship only a couple of years into their careers. PDFORRA president, Mr. Mark Keane, says that only a couple of the 33 members who had so far sought to be discharged in the past month were actually eligible to retire this year. That suggests young, able and very experienced personnel are getting out fast. The figure cited averages to approximately one member per day. If that continued, the Naval Service would lose one third of its personnel in one year. Mr. Keane says seasoned petty officers and leading seamen with a wealth of experience are among those seeking to leave the service, which will have a serious effect on the level of corporate knowledge within the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_160"> What is the Minister of State doing to address this serious loss of experienced personnel from the Naval Service? What is he going to do to train new persons coming into the service given that extent to which middle management and those with experience are leaving and unavailable to train recruits?</p>

            <p eId="para_161">As I stated in my original reply, there are a number of initiatives and pay increases in place. The establishment of the Naval Service is 1,094 and on 31 January 2018 its strength stood at 1,051. Recruitment is ongoing within the Naval Service. As with the Air Corps and the Army, there are vacancies and I understand that there is recruitment for skilled people. I am happy to confirm to the House that the Defence Forces assures me it can carry out all the duties assigned by Government and set out in the White Paper on Defence. I am confident that the Naval Service is carrying out all requests and assignments related to sea fisheries protection, participation in Operation Sophia and drug interdiction.</p>

            <p eId="para_162">This is a little bit like Groundhog Day. We keep talking about pay restoration and ongoing recruitment, but while recruitment has been stepped up, we are running to keep still and not actually increasing numbers. The Minister of State has not addressed the very clear issue that over 30 personnel in one month have sought a discharge in circumstances where only a couple of them were actually at retirement age. Clearly, the measures the Minister of State has adopted to date are not having the required impact. The Minister of State has also not addressed what we are going to do to train new personnel if experienced personnel are lost. What are we going to do to address the brain drain and the loss of corporate knowledge? Taking in new personnel is one thing, but how are we going to retain the personnel we have? The White Paper on defence is not being implemented properly. A Defence Forces climate survey was published in 2015 but we have seen no marked change in the approach of the Department or the Minister of State's office to address the issues which were highlighted in that. It is nearly three years since its publication. What is the Minister of State doing to address the fact that more than 30 personnel have sought a discharge in one month?</p>

            <p eId="para_163">I have introduced a range of measures on foot of the climate survey, including a review of contracts, a review of the CNA scheme and a review of pay and conditions. The Defence Forces themselves have advanced a more structured and monitored mentoring programme, improved notice of courses and improved transparent selection of courses, more direct communication between senior leadership and the general body of personnel, improved internal communications, improved notice of travel requirements for duties and a review of centralisation and duration of career courses. These are all issues that were highlighted in the climate survey and they are being monitored. A working group has been put in place in the Defence Forces and I have brought in a range of measures. The full strength of the Defence Forces should be 9,500 and they are fully funded to reach that level. I have actively arranged recruitment meetings to see exactly where we are on the figures in the Defence Forces but it is a matter for Defence Forces management to ensure they are brought up to that strength of 9,500. The Government provides the budget for that.</p>

            <p eId="para_167">I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together. As part of a whole of Government approach, my Department is engaged in forward planning with the other Departments involved in addressing all issues relevant to the UK decision to leave the European Union. The progress made as part of the first phase of the Brexit negotiations offers encouragement in relation to Border issues whereby a significant commitment has been made to avoid a hard border.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">Of itself, the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union does not give rise to additional Border control requirements at this time. Therefore, there is no reason to revisit earlier decisions on the closure of barracks. The closures enhanced the operational readiness and deployability of Defence Forces personnel and, with other measures, involved the redeployment of personnel from barracks, headquarters and administrative posts to front-line operational units. This has improved the effectiveness of the Defence Forces without in any way reducing the quality of the military contribution. In that regard, as I have outlined previously, it is, of course, important to note that primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspects of Border control rests with An Garda Síochána, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities related to their particular mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_169"> Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of aid for the civil power which, in practice, means providing assistance and support for An Garda Síochána when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support for the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces on security matters and regular co-ordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department will, of course, continue to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address potential issues that might arise in the area of defence as a consequence of Brexit.</p>

          <p eId="para_170">Last Friday, with Deputy Billy Kelleher, I met a group of Alpha-1 patients who were on the drug Respreeza and who told us their stories and individual case histories. From 2006 onwards they had been part of a clinical trial involving the drug, which slows down the progression of emphysema in patients with severe Alpha-1 deficiency. From 2010 onwards they had been part of a compassionate access programme which had been ceased by the company, CSL Behring, in September 2017. Following discussions the company made the drug available again, but the HSE refused to administer it. There was an unedifying impasse and in the intervening period two patients, Anna Cassidy and Marion Kelly, died. A compromise was then reached. It will last until May. All of the patients I met had been on the drug for years. All had reported the benefits of the drug for them, to which their families testified. I met Marion Kelly's sister, Niamh. Marion had been the youngest of the cohort of patients who had benefited hugely from Respreeza. Niamh Kelly said that when Marion had come off the drug, she deteriorated rapidly. All of the patients I met had deteriorated rapidly once they had come off the drug. Anna Cassidy and Marion Kelly should never have died. That they did is a very sad reflection on all concerned - the company, the Government and the service provided. They died while there was an unedifying row taking place and the drug was lying in a warehouse. A third party is administering the drug as part of the compromise reached. </p>
          <p eId="para_171"> There are articles in <i>The Lancet</i> and <i>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine</i> which confirm the efficacy of the drug in slowing down the progression of emphysema in the cohort of patients in question. In the United States 6,000 people are on Respreeza, while the authorities in Germany, France and large parts of Italy reimburse the cost. As the European Medicines Agency has approved the drug, why has Ireland not done so? Professor Noel G. McElvaney in Beaumont Hospital has been the lead clinician in this area for quite some time. Why do we ignore his expertise? He is the only European member of the Alpha One Foundation. The Minister for Health has said he wants engagement and asked the HSE to engage with the company. It has not engaged. There has been no engagement. Will the Government intervene to ensure a physical meeting will take place between the company and the HSE to have the issue resolved and ensure reimbursement will take place? That is the only way the matter can be resolved. If it is happening all over Europe and the United States, why is it not happening in Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_172">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I do not have a note on it to hand, but I have some knowledge, given that the matter has been in the public domain and from discussions I have had with the Minister for Health about it. It is the policy of the Government to endeavour to ensure patients in Ireland will have access to new medicines. That has been our policy for a very long time, but we also have a duty to make sure medicines are effective and that the price taxpayers pay for them is reasonable in order that more people can be treated and more services made available to patients who need them. It has been set out in legislation for quite some time that the Government does not decide on which medicines should be reimbursed. That is decided by the HSE's national drugs committee which takes the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. There is expert advice which is put together by doctors, pharmacologists and economists - people who know about these things - who pass it on to the HSE's national drugs committee which then makes a decision on whether the cost of a medicine should be reimbursed. As the Deputy will be aware, decision on reimbursement is not the same as a decision on licensing. That is the process involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> We have had some interesting discussions in recent weeks on when politicians should and should not intervene in a legal or statutory process. This is a statutory process, of which the Deputy will be aware, because the legislation was passed by the Oireachtas to set up the system the way it is. The experts in the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics give advice and the HSE's national drugs committee decides. That is how it is done, but that is not to say Ministers cannot request that meetings take place. I will certainly speak to the Minister and ask him to encourage the company to engage with the committee. That would be the right course of action to take. </p>
          <p eId="para_174"> One very sorry feature of this affair is the way the manufacturer behaved. When a patient is put on a new drug, either as part of a trial or a compassionate programme, it is standard practice for companies not to withdraw the medicine. While a decision might be made not to extend it to new groups or new patients because of efficacy or the high cost involved, it has been standard practice for a very long time for companies to allow patients already on a medicine to continue to receive it. The company in question has behaved very badly and unethically in not providing the medicine for patients already on it. I hope the Deputy will join with me in echoing that sentiment.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">The bottom line is that two people have died. The Taoiseach can talk about systems all he likes, but more people will die if the issue is not resolved. The system described by him is not working; it is failing. Professor McElvaney has been the lead clinician in this area for well over a decade. He has worked on the Alpha-1 gene and Alpha-1 deficiency and his expertise has been ignored. In respect of the Helsinki Declaration, about which the Taoiseach spoke, the company was wrong, but, equally, the Government and the HSE were wrong because the declaration is very clear. It states that "in advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post-trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial". Our side - the Government - is not stepping up to the plate. It can act in a hands-off way all it likes, but that is not going to work. In respect of the insecurity the people in question face when they wait while nothing is happening, what is happening is inhumane. The Minister asked the HSE, but it has ignored him. There have been no meetings and no engagement. The company acknowledges fault and spoke to Niamh Kelly, the sister of Marion Kelly. It is willing and anxious to engage. All we are talking about are 21 patients on the island, but we go on about being hands-off and how it is this and that system. For God's sake, let us bring some humanity back to the health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_179"> This morning's quarterly report from the Residential Tenancies Board makes for very grim reading. Average rent levels in Dublin, the greater Dublin area and across the State are utterly scandalous. Yesterday I raised with the Tánaiste the issue of the working poor or the just-getting-by class, as I described them. I set out for him in the clearest way the manner in which these workers and families were struggling and today these scandalous rent figures have been published. They reflect the fact that the Government's stated ambition to achieve rent certainty or affordability is clearly failing. Its policy is failing. That average rent across the State is €1,054 is a cause of shame and disgrace. It is unaffordable for working families, people at work who get up very early in the morning, work very hard and have the modest aspiration of having a secure roof over their heads. What is the Government going to do? The situation is clearly not sustainable. When will the Government introduce real rent certainty?</p>

          <p eId="para_180">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as a cuid ceiste. Tá innéacs náisiúnta cíosa an mBord um Thionóntachtaí Cónaithe le foilsiú inniu don ceathrú deireanach de 2017. Taispeánann sé gur ardaigh cíosanna príobháideacha 6.4% ar fud na tíre i gcomparáid leis an tréimhse 12 mhí chéanna in 2016. Mhoilligh an ráta fáis le gnáthchíosanna a ardú 1.1% idir mí Dheireadh Fómhair agus mí na Nollag 2017 i gcomparáid le 2.5% idir mí Iúil agus mí Mheán Fómhair 2017. I am very aware, like everybody on this side of the House, of the pressures people are under when it comes to rising rents. The Deputy referred to people who get up early in the morning, are just about managing and have to work very hard to cover the cost of rent, after which they have to meet other costs such as child care, as well as the general cost of living. People face difficulties in trying to pay rent, while at the same time trying to save money to buy their first home. I do not know if the Deputy had a chance to listen to "Morning Ireland" this morning on which the head of the Residential Tenancies Board spoke about the figures. She spoke from a very informed and balanced point of view. I encourage people who are interested in the facts to listen to the interview because it was very informative.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> The index shows that in the fourth quarter of 2017 rents rose by 6.4% across the country. The rate of increase is slowing. The figures show that standard rents increased by only 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 2.5% in the third quarter. They indicate that in Dublin, for example, rents are increasing at their lowest rates since 2013. That indicates two things to me. It indicates that the market is beginning to stabilise and that what people are willing and able to pay is much closer to what landlords are able to charge. It also shows that the rent pressure zones are starting to work. Of course, these are new tenancies and for new tenancies, rents have increased by 6.4% in the last year and that rate is slowing. For existing tenancies, the rate of increase, with some exceptions, is 4% or less.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">Tá sé seo ar fad cloiste againn cheana féin. The Taoiseach has sung that song previously. It is very alarming that he is simply satisfied that the runaway levels of rent inflation have started to abate. It seems, in the Taoiseach's mind at least, that the mission has been accomplished. In Dublin average rent stands at €1,511. As it happens, I heard the interview to which the Taoiseach referred and the woman in question was very well informed, but let me tell him who is even better informed. The best informed people on this issue are the families and workers who are expected to find over €1,500 simply to cover their rent. By the way, they are many of the same people who are in insecure work, on low pay and up early and hard at it and simply cannot make it.</p>

If that is his view, it is not one I share with him. I again put it to him that we need real rent certainty and affordability in Dublin and across the State.</p>

Therefore, I certainly have not been able to sing this song previously because it is four or five years since it would have been possible to make that statement. Notwithstanding this, the Government is acting. We have already introduced the rent pressure zones by which most tenants are covered and which ensure that, except in some exceptional circumstances, rents increases are lower than 4%. In addition, other actions involve strengthening the enforcement powers of the Residential Tenancies Board and new legislation targeted for publication this term which will make it an offence to break the RPZ guidelines.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">This is World Down Syndrome Day and I know that the Taoiseach will want to join me in sending good wishes to all members of the Down's syndrome community and their families in Ireland and throughout the world. I wish I could say services for people with Down's syndrome and other intellectual disabilities were even adequate in the State, but, sadly, they are not. Under the Disability Act 2005, the assessment of need must begin no later than three months after receiving a completed application form and be completed no later than three months after the date it begins. A constituent of mine who was told that her daughter would have to wait 12 months for an assessment of need made a complaint to the disability complaints officer. At the time she had complaint No. 1111 about the assessment of need process and was told that there was a five to six-month delay in even responding to complaints. Is that right in this day and age? The child in question was referred in May 2016 for an assessment of need and there is no sign of any such assessment coming down the tracks. It is likely that it will be May of this year before the child is assessed, which is truly shocking. Recently I received two separate telephone calls from parents whose children were attending the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in south Tipperary suffering from severe social anxiety and other mental health issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">These children have been referred to the early intervention and disability services team for an assessment of needs but they have been told to expect delays of 12 to 18 months. Can the Taoiseach imagine those households, the anxiety, pressure and stress on the parents? These children were due to start secondary school in September and have no services. Even the fact they have received urgent referrals from CAMHS should be sufficient to ensure they are seen to but that is not sufficient. There are major issues, even after the assessment, where children who have been assessed are left waiting for occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy among other services. What is the Government doing to address this? Along with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, it ratified the UN convention last week. I was told by the same Minister of State that a major reconfiguration of the therapy resources for children with disabilities, aged up to 18 years, was well under way. The national programme, Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, from zero to 18, was supposed to bring staff from different services providers together into children's disability network teams. It has not happened. Will the Taoiseach give us some assurance that this will happen? When will it happen? Is there any point to ratifying conventions and having Disability Acts passed if we do not put our money where our mouth is and put the people in place to deliver these services?</p>

          <p eId="para_198">I thank the Deputy for raising this question and reminding us of the day that is in it. I am not in a position to comment on individual cases. I do not have the information to hand and, for reasons of privacy, I should not do so anyway. If the Deputy wants to pass that on to my office or that of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability affairs, I will certainly have it examined. We absolutely acknowledge that there are unacceptable delays for people waiting for their assessment of needs. With regard to what we have been doing, to give a few examples, the Deputy mentioned that after decades of delays under many previous parties that served in government, we have now passed a Dáil resolution to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will travel to New York to deposit the instrument of ratification in the period ahead. We also made a major change relating to medical cards. The Deputy will know that for years, particularly when other parties were in power, people with disabilities, particularly children, had to fight for their medical cards. We changed the law last year to ensure that any child with a severe disability in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance had a medical card as a right, irrespective of their parents' income. Some 10,000 additional medical cards were provided that way and 40,000 children no longer faced reviews of their medical cards. The Deputy will recall that the Government led by the party opposite took €11.50 a week from people with disabilities and carers. We have started to reverse those cuts. The first reversal was last year and the second reversal will happen next week, when there is a €5 per week increase in the disability allowance and carer's allowance. We intend to fully reverse those cuts to people's welfare payments in the next budget, and more. We fully reversed the cuts to the respite care grant and, later this year, we will extend the doctor visit card to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance.</p>

Instead of a €5 million spin machine, would the Taoiseach install mirrors in his office and get a gramophone that will tell him that he is in power, in government, that it was not like that when he got here, that he has been in power for seven years now and should stop blaming the past for everything? He should have someone to pinch him every day to remind him that he is in power and should not be tweeting about something else. He is not even remotely engaged with the people. There are over 1,100 constituents in Tipperary alone waiting for these services. When will the Minister of State put in place psychotherapists, occupational therapists and others? Going to America will not fill many of those positions. In Clonmel alone, those vacancies have been compounded and the dreadful situation in south Tipperary clearly needs to be addressed urgently. What is the HSE doing to ensure that the vacancies in the intellectual disability services are being filled? I suggest that it is doing nothing. It is time for the Taoiseach to get real, cut out the spin and get some substance into his Taoiseach-hood before it passes him by. The people will not be interested in spinning when he goes out to knock on the doors. They will be waiting in the long grass and the grass will not be cut either.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I have given the Deputy many examples of the kinds of things that the Government has done in the last seven years, such as a major increase in funding for disability services, the almost total reversal of the welfare cuts made by Fianna Fáil for people with disabilities, and the extension of medical cards as a right to children with severe disabilities. They are very real things which have really made a difference for real people. We have targeted three things we particularly want to do this year with regard to disabilities. The first is a significant improvement in respite. Some 12 new respite houses will open across the country. We are confident that we will get them all open through the course of the year. The Deputy will know that respite is a lifeline for families. Sometimes, the fact that they can get some respite keeps them going.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">De réir mar a thuigim, tháinig an Taoiseach isteach sa Dáil aréir agus chuir sé in iúl gur polaiteoir é a chuireann béim ar fhreagraí díreacha. Táim ag tnúth le freagraí díreacha anois. Táim ag díriú isteach ar chúrsaí meabhairshláinte. Tagaim ó chathair atá ag fanacht le hionad nua. Tá ionad síciatrach ann. Tá 45 leaba istigh ann. Tá níos mó ná 50 othar san ionad sin. Chomh maith leis sin, tá cuid de chosmhuintir na cathrach páirteach i bpatról slándála ag iarraidh daoine a choinneáil ó na huiscebhealaí de bharr go bhfuil sé ar intinn acu lámh a chur ina mbás féin. Sin an cúlra atá agam ón gcathair.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> An pointe ginearálta atá á dhéanamh agam, agus an cheist atá á cur agam, ná cá bhfuil an t-athbhreithniú ar A Vision For Change? Sin plean forásach cuimsitheach. Ba é an tréimhse ama a bhí i gceist ná 2006 go 2016 - tréimhse deich mbliana. Insan fhís sin bhí chuile rud - idir an fhís agus na rudaí a bhí le déanamh. Anois táimid in 2018 agus, in ainneoin na ngeallúintí uilig mar gheall ar athbhreithniú, fós níl athbhreithniú againn. An rud atá léite agam ná athbhreithniú ar litríocht idirnáisiúnta ó thaobh chúrsaí meabhairshláinte de. Thóg sé sin dhá bhliain agus 12 seachtain. An dáta atá ar sin ná mí Feabhra 2016. Thóg sé go dtí Iúil 2016 é sin a fhoilsiú. Tá sé foilsithe anois agus táimid fós ag fanacht ar athbhreithniú ar an doiciméid A Vision For Change. Tá sé ráite linn go bhfuil grúpa maoirseachta - nó oversight body - bunaithe agus tá duine i gceannas air, ach dhá bhliain agus trí mhí tar éis an phlean sin a bheith críochnaithe níl athbhreithniú fós againn. </p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil an Taoiseach ró-thógtha le miotas so níl mé ag súil le freagra indíreach. Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach go díreach stádas an athbhreithnithe sin. Cá bhfuil sé? Cé atá i gceannas? Cé mhéad cruinnithe a bhí ag an ngrúpa maoirseachta seo? Cén scála ama atá i gceist ag an Rialtas maidir leis an athbhreithniú atá geallta? I mo thuairim féin, níl gá le athbhreithniú mar tá sé ráite gurb é an t-aon fhadhb a bhí leis A Vision For Change ná nár cuireadh é i bhfeidhm.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">Aontaíodh creatlach oibre a chinnteoidh go gcríochneofar obair an choiste maoirseachta roimh dheireadh na bliana. The A Vision for Change oversight committee was convened in October 2017 with the objective of updating the A Vision for Change mental health strategy. A work plan has been agreed and will ensure that the work of the oversight group will be completed before the end of the year. The priority considerations of the oversight group include but are not limited to primary prevention, early intervention and positive mental health; integration of care and delivery systems between primary and secondary services; development of e-mental health responses; workforce planning, forecasting and skill mix, including mechanisms to attract and retain staff; the emerging needs of vulnerable groups such as people with comorbidities and specialist needs, as informed by the relevant programmes; the development of research data and evaluation capability to ensure achievement of best mental health outcomes can be demonstrated with the resources available; and proposing policy changes or enhancements that will benefit all those engaged with mental health services, with a particular emphasis on social inclusion and the needs of vulnerable groups, with the focus on reducing stigma and discrimination. The oversight group is determined that its work will focus on developing measurable outcomes and has emphasised the importance of stakeholder and focus groups in the formation of final recommendations. Those consultations are anticipated to commence in the near future. Subgroups have considered how best to build on existing policies and resources and have agreed there should be a focus on identifying gaps in current policy.</p>

Ní féidir an t-ionad nua a oscailt de bharr easpa foirne. Ba mhaith liom dul ar ais go dtí mo chéad cheist. Bhí mé ag súil le freagra díreach. Cén uair a bheidh an t-athbhreithniú críochnaithe? Tá ceist eile agam. An bhfuil na tuarascálacha léite ag an Taoiseach? Níl gá le athbhreithniú eile. Bhí an tuarascáil a d'fhoilsíodh i mí Iúil 2017 ag caint faoi "light refresh" - b'shin an méid - ós rud é go raibh chuile rud clúdaithe in A Vision for Change. Níl aon gá le haon rud eile ach A Vision for Change a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá gá le beart leis an straitéis sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá sé seo ráite ag na haltraí síciatrach, ag an gCoimisiún Meabhair-Shláinte agus ag chuile dream, ach tá an Taoiseach fós ag caint faoi tuilleadh athbhreithnithe.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">I do not have any specific information on the psychiatric unit in Galway but the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, who has responsibility for mental health and older people, will revert to the Deputy with a detailed response. In terms of the issue more generally, the A Vision for Change review will be completed by the end of the year. We look forward to doing that. As the Deputy is aware, over 70% of the staffing need identified in the existing A Vision for Change document has been achieved and we are looking at new and more modern ways to deliver mental health online, with trials being progressed to overcome some of the staffing challenges. The budget for mental health services has significantly increased by almost €200 million since 2012, from €711 million to €910 million, a 28% increase. We have committed to a further increase of €55 million in 2019.</p>

Mar is eol dó freisin, tá raic ar siúl faoi láthair maidir leis an mhéid atá ag tarlú le Cambridge Analytica agus Facebook. Tá daoine ar fud na hEorpa agus ar fud an domhain buartha agus feargach faoin mhéid atá tar éis titim amach. Mar is léir anois, tá sé scanrúil nach raibh aon saghas cosc ar na comhlachtaí móra maidir le eolas príobháideach an saoránach. Tá mé ag súil go mbeidh an Bille seo os comhair an choiste sar i bhfad. Tá sé tábhachtach go n-admhaíonn an Rialtas go bhfuil gá ann reachtaíocht a chur i bhfeidhm chun cosc a chur leis na comhlachtaí móra seo.

          <p eId="para_227">I am advised that the Bill was rushed through the Dáil before Christmas without proper and due consideration. The experts who have since examined it have stated that it is riddled with technical and legal flaws and, in particular, presents serious unintended consequences for the democratic process itself. For example, the definition of "political end" in the Bill is so broad that the Bill essentially prohibits the spending of public money on any kind of online advertising on any matter dealt with or funded by the State. It could even prevent a public meeting organised by a local authority about a landfill from being advertised online. Although I am sure Deputy Lawless was well intentioned, this is perhaps a case of poor legislation being rushed through the Dáil------</p>

Maidir leis an raic atá ann faoi Cambridge Analytica, mura gcuirfear srian reachtúil ar na comhlachtaí seo, cuirfidh an chumhacht atá acu alltacht agus sceon ar dhaoine. Tá an Bille um Chosaint Sonraí 2018 ag dul trí Thithe an Oireachtais faoi láthair. The Department of Justice and Equality yesterday published an amendment to section 43 of the Data Protection Bill, ostensibly to the end of restraining companies such as Cambridge Analytica. However, the amendment is not good enough. It does not properly define when data can be used for political purposes and, as it stands, leaves the data of citizens wide open to abuse. Consent is key. Citizens should know for what purpose their data is being gathered and used. Ba chóir don Aire, an Teachta Flanagan, athdhréachtú iomlán a dhéanamh ar an mBille. Does the Taoiseach accept that the provisions as currently drafted, including the new amendment, in regard to data use for political purposes are contrary to the European general data protection regulation, GDPR? What protections will the Government offer to ensure people are protected from abuse of their data?</p>

Obviously, there were earnest protests from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, indicating that this would be the last time such an appointments system would be allowed, but seeing as he has allowed many judges to be appointed, that remains to be seen. When will the Judicial Appointments Bill be brought forward on Report Stage?

          <p eId="para_241">In the education section of the programme for Government the Government promised to establish "a new relationship with students" and also promised to improve accessibility to third level education. I wonder what the Taoiseach thinks in that context of the row that took place last week between students in Trinity College, who were forced to occupy college buildings over attempts to introduce absolutely extortionate repeat exam fees of €450; to increase on-campus student accommodation to €240 per week; to further increase, for the third or fourth year in a row, postgraduate fees and non-EU student fees as well as dramatic increases in registration fees in recent years. I went to Trinity College a couple of times last week and the students said their relationship with the college authorities was broken. They said trust had completely broken down and they were appalled at what this meant in terms of access, in particular for working class students, and they wanted to know that the Government and politicians would back the students in their fight against those extortionate fees.</p>

          <p eId="para_245"> As reported by Lara Marlowe and Pat Leahy in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, was asked what would happen if the proposed referendum on the eighth amendment was lost. She replied: "The people who have brought us, and who have been very vocal on this issue for a number of years, they are certainly not going to accept a No." While declining to say directly if the Government would call a second poll in the event of a rejection, Ms Doherty said she envisaged the pro-choice movement would strongly push for one. The remarks have caused significant concern among those who are campaigning in good faith to retain the eighth amendment. Is it the intention of the Government to campaign for another referendum if the proposed repeal of the eighth amendment is unsuccessful? Those remarks go to the heart of the fears many people have about the entire campaign and the mockery and sham of the democratic process. Is there collective Cabinet responsibility and will the Taoiseach restrain the Minister and ask her to withdraw her remarks or is it what will happen and we are only hearing about it in a leak such as this? It is shameful.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">The programme for Government commits that significant Exchequer resources are invested in both current and capital spending in the higher education sector. As other Deputies have raised, in Trinity College, the Taoiseach's own alma mater, in recent weeks the burden of investment in education has fallen squarely on the shoulders of students with the introduction of a €450 flat fee for supplemental exams. The Minister has just said that the protests and the ongoing negotiations have nothing to do with the Government but at the heart of this issue is the Government's lack of investment in higher education which is leading to those stealth fees being imposed on students. The current situation in Trinity College is that the students are waiting for the ongoing negotiations with the university administration to conclude and the exams are only a month away, which is causing unnecessary stress for the students. What plans does the Taoiseach have to further invest in higher education to prevent universities from resorting to demanding those types of fees from vulnerable students in the future?</p>

In the investment plan outlined in Project Ireland 2040, we have also set out investment plans for €2.2 billion in the third level sector overall. We have very considerable ambitions for the improvement and growth of the third level sector as a key element in achieving balanced regional development. We have big ambitions for the third level sector and they are endorsed very clearly in the ten-year spending plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">The Rebuilding Ireland programme has some very ambitious targets for providing homes by county councils this year and in future years. A very basic commodity must exist in order to achieve real traction in tackling the crisis and building homes for people, namely, land. I rarely hear speakers mention the word "land" in debates only people roaring and shouting that they want houses. They must think they are built on thin air because I do not hear people talk about that very basic commodity of land. In County Meath, bar one landlocked piece of land, we have no publicly owned land and consequently we cannot build council housing estates. I asked the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Mr. John McCarthy, about that at the Committee of Public Accounts two weeks ago and he said the Department would not get into the business of funding the buying of land. If we do not have publicly owned land, where the housing crisis is at its worst, and we do not intend to buy it so that we can build on it, is it not the case that the problem will only get worse?</p>

Last week, I welcomed that the Taoiseach and other Ministers were selling Ireland all over the world to the best of their ability. Two of our greatest sports heroes, Gary and Paul O'Donovan, from the world class Skibbereen rowing club, are also selling Ireland all over the world, both on and off the sporting field. Gary and Paul are a media magnet, prompting calls last week from the Australian media for their tourism bodies to sign them up to sell Australia. Before we lose such valuable assets to that country, will the Taoiseach work with Fáilte Ireland to provide funds for both Gary and Paul to promote Ireland when travelling all over the world?</p>

After committing to engage, and negotiate a new contract, with the branch managers last October, on reaching agreement on the remuneration aspect of the issues raised the Department ended the talks, refused to engage and put an outright end to negotiating with the branch managers' association, bizarrely citing competition laws, which makes no sense. The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, needs to put the proposed payment structure in place, as already agreed, treat the branch managers fairly with a contract that actually deals with the issues they have raised, and produce a revised list of the work and services they are expected to provide. The treatment of the branch managers has to be described as appalling. It is a sad reflection on Government and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. Will the Taoiseach ensure there is engagement with the branch managers, that the remuneration package, as agreed, will be rolled out and put in place and that all the other aspects that have been raised will be dealt with by him?</p>

I understand that because of the software in the Revenue Commissioners some people who applied for the help-to-buy scheme were given a commitment in error by the Revenue Commissioners that they qualified for the scheme. Following an audit of the help-to-buy scheme, letters issued on 7 and 8 March regarding this issue and people are being told they are no longer entitled to join the scheme. They are being told they will have to repay the money, pay a fine of €3,000 or €5,000 and an interest rate per day of a percentage of that. Depending on how that is calculated, it comes to more than €100,000. Is the Minister taking control of this very serious issue?

The Taoiseach knows the weather has had a very bad effect on farmers. There are no cattle out. There is a scarcity of fodder and a massive increase in the cost of fodder they can buy. Farmers need money right now. Representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association are in town today, and I welcome them to Dublin. They are a great organisation fighting on behalf of our farming community but if the remaining GLAS payments cannot be issued, surely an advance payment can issue immediately if there are problems in particular cases. Farmers need their money now, not next month or in a couple of weeks' time. Anybody who has cattle in a shed and is running out of feed is trying to buy feed. There is no grass growing. The Taoiseach might not know about grass growing under his feet but I can tell him there is no grass growing, and that is causing an awful problem for farmers throughout the country. I ask the Taoiseach to please get this issue dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">Louth County Council has received €2.2 million from the European Regional Development Fund and the council has matched the funding through development levies, so it has €4.4 million to spend in Dundalk. That money has to be spent very soon. The council intends to spend the money on Clanbrassil Street and Church Street, leaving out Bridge Street and an adjoining street. It was hoping the €4.4 million would do the job. Louth County Council has agreed to expand the design to include Bridge Street plus the adjoining street. That will mean we will know how much it will cost and what is needed. However, Louth County Council has no money but it has made a commitment that it will match the funding. In terms of Brexit, we do not know whether we will have a soft, hard or no border. Dundalk needs this development, which will take between 12 to 18 months to complete. It will be a shame if only half the job is completed. I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is in the Chamber.

          <p eId="para_286">I raise the issue of afforestation in County Leitrim which has been highlighted previously in the House. More than 18% of County Leitrim is under forestry. Arable land is being bought for plantation, with townland after townland being bought up and planted. People can no longer exist. This practice must be curtailed because European policy is that not more than 17% of a county should be under afforestation. The amount of land in County Leitrim under forest far exceeds 17% and the figure will continue to increase unless something is done. It is wrong that people who are not farmers are receiving grants to plant land, particularly in an area in which there is excessive forestry.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">I note the Deputy's comments and concern. Afforestation and more forestry are part of our response to climate change and very much part of our climate action plan. At the same time, I acknowledge that, for many people, having to live beside a forest or in a heavily forested area impacts on their lives and residential amenity. I will ask the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Andrew Doyle, to furnish the Deputy with a more detailed answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_290">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to give the Residential Tenancies Board investigative powers and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I hope the Government will not stand in the way of this legislation which will improve the powers available to the Residential Tenancies Board in the growing rental market. More than 325,000 properties are leased in private accommodation and housing assistance payments are made in respect of 32,000 of these units. The absence of necessary regulation in this area has resulted in compromises being made in respect of health and safety, overcrowding and the way in which tenants are treated. For this reason, we have introduced the Bill to improve the powers of the Residential Tenancies Board to allow it to initiate investigations and, where necessary, pass the results of same on to the relevant authorities. This is in addition to other measures the Fianna Fáil Party is seeking to introduce to give local authorities the power to implement a system for certifying properties for rental purposes similar to the national car test. In the meantime, it is necessary and appropriate to make this amendment to resource the Residential Tenancies Board and improve its powers and ability to ensure tenants' rights are not compromised in any shape or form. There has been an unwillingness to address this matter in the way in which one would expect. I ask the Government to allow the Bill to proceed to the next Stage in order that the relevant committee will have an opportunity to make the improvements proposed and enhance the position of everyone concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_447">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_448"> As I previously informed the House, a review is currently being undertaken into the work of the strategic communications unit. This review will be concluded before Easter. The results of this review will inform the future structure, role and work plan of the unit. </p>
            <p eId="para_449"> A clear instruction was given from the SCU to the media buyer that all media partnerships needed to be clearly identifiable as such. This was to be achieved by the use of the wording, "brought to you in partnership with Project Ireland 2040" or "brought to you in partnership with Project Ireland 2040, an initiative of the Government of Ireland". A decision was not taken to ask that the advertorial should resemble news reporting. I am happy to refute that allegation once again.</p>
            <p eId="para_450"> In keeping with previous national development plans, Project Ireland 2040 is being communicated to citizens through media partnerships. Content partnerships were established with the following media outlets:<i> The Irish Times</i>, the INM Group, the Examiner Group, Journal Media and a suite of 30 regional newspapers. While the full spend will not be finalised until the end of the campaign, an indicative budget of €1.5 million was allocated for Project 2040. However, it is now envisaged that this will not all be spent. No meetings were held with editors of regional newspapers. In the development of content partnership agreements, management and editorial staff of national newspapers were met by staff members.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_209">
            <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_451">I made a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland which made me look at the codes of the authority. One particular code states, "A marketing communication should not mislead, or be likely to mislead, by inaccuracy, ambiguity, exaggeration, omission or otherwise." There is, at the very least, ambiguity in respect of some of these advertorials. That is being kind. They resembled and could have been interpreted by the reader as a normal editorial as opposed to an advertisement. Lines were significantly blurred as a consequence. I asked some parliamentary questions and I got replies to them last night. I was shocked at the amount of money being spent on advertising. That is a separate issue and I do not want to conflate the two issues because I think the strategic communications unit is causing a serious problem. The Taoiseach would not be reviewing it if it was not.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> One company was paid just under €250,000. I am flabbergasted at the amount. Some of this is cross-departmental. There is a significant issue in respect of value for the money that is being spent. I do not want to conflate the two issues. The strategic communications unit is a serious blurring of the lines between politics and the public service. That does neither politics nor the public service any favours. It should not just be reviewed but should be dispensed with.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_210">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_453">In yesterday's petty and self-regarding speech from the Taoiseach, he again questioned why we should be talking about this at all. I must remind the Taoiseach that it was he who made this a personal priority and devoted significant Government time and resources to it. After only nine months in office, the Taoiseach is becoming increasingly intolerant of people challenging him. We have reached a serious moment where he believes he owns the Government while Parliament should stay quiet and get out of the way. That is the only way I can interpret his behaviour on this particular issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_454"> It has been leaked by his staff that the official who oversees the unit will report that everything is fine with the unit and that any mistakes were made by outsiders. It appears to be the Taoiseach's position that he will use this closed internal review to declare vindication and move on. Yesterday the Taoiseach said the Dáil has no right to interfere in a purely Civil Service matter. That is a serious construct to put on matters. Documents released under freedom of information legislation show that it was the Taoiseach who instructed the unit be established, recommended its head and brought a memo to Cabinet to finalise its establishment. At every stage, this was a political process led by the Head of Government who is directly and constitutionally responsible to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_455"> Will the Taoiseach respect the will of Parliament or will he carry on regardless? Will he continue to deny the right of the Dáil to a say on the matter which he and his Government are involved in as it is a Government political priority? Will he indicate the national newspaper editors met by his staff, which he outlined at the end of his answer? Does he accept policies determined by him are open for parliamentary scrutiny and accountability?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_211">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_456">Yesterday the Dáil debated a Sinn Féin motion calling for the disbandment of the strategic communications unit. If he were wise, the Taoiseach would take heed and credence of that. Questions have arisen not just about value for money - I do not wish to conflate the issue of advertising either as Deputy Catherine Murphy has said - but, more importantly, the appropriate uses of public moneys. It is a communications disaster to ignore the fact that those questions have now arisen, not simply among political rivals or those who, as the Taoiseach said, may wish to dent his popularity, but among the general public and taxpayers who actually fund all of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_457"> For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Taoiseach stands by a review that is internal in its nature and whose independence, irrespective of the qualities of the persons involved, comes into question. I cannot understand why he is clinging to this so rigidly. The smarter way ahead, and what would communicate a progressive message to the public we serve, would be if the Taoiseach stated he is willing to stand this unit down and in a collegiate and non-party way that we put our heads together to decide the best and most efficient way to enhance all of Government communications. Members are more than able to participate in such a project. It would certainly demonstrate bona fides on the part of the Taoiseach. So far, however, blindly, arrogantly and in a high-handed way, he has suggested the Dáil has no business to ask questions on this matter. That is quite an outrageous position for any Taoiseach to take.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_212">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_458">The Taoiseach has made many comments on the strategic communications unit since it became a matter of controversy, including saying the unit itself was getting in the way of the communication of the Government's message. Has he inputted into the review himself in his own reviews?</p>
            <p eId="para_459"> Regarding the Sinn Féin motion before the House, if Dáil Éireann votes for the abolition of the unit, will the Taoiseach respect and implement that instruction?</p>
            <p eId="para_460"> As the unit is currently extant, is it still advertising? Will the Taoiseach agree that full transparency on the type of advertising needs to be made now?

Was there an allocated budget planned for local radio advertising by the unit? If so, how much was it?</p>

I am sure I will not always be Taoiseach. I have immense respect for the House, having sat in many positions in it. I also obviously understand the separation of powers and the different role that Parliament has to the Government. A Government's role is executive and it makes decisions. The Parliament's role is legislative in that it passes primary legislation and can annul secondary legislation.</p>

When they are not backed up by evidence, the decent thing is to withdraw them. There has been much of that. Making stuff up is not showing respect for the House. I just heard a Member say that I said the Dáil should not ask questions. I never said that. I do not believe people should make stuff up. That is not respectful to the House. I do not believe conspiracy theories are respectful to the House either. There have been so many of them. I am waiting for people to allege that I was somehow involved in the assassination of JFK on the basis I visited Dealey Plaza in Dallas last week. Conspiracy theories are beneath people and disrespect the House. Misquoting people is too.</p>

            <p eId="para_484">What I will do is take into account the vote on the motion when it happens and I will also look at the review that is being carried out by the Secretary General to the Government. I think the right thing for the Opposition parties to do would have been to wait for the review before tabling the motion. It would be the correct procedure if the review is under way to wait for that review to be done, particularly if it is going to be done in a few weeks, and after that to table the motion. I suppose it was a political move to pre-empt that by tabling the motion in advance of the review, even though the review is already under way. That is just politics. It was a political tactic and I can live with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> On conspiracy theories, every theory is not a conspiracy theory but there have been plenty of them. The Deputies can check the record from yesterday and I hope they will have a laugh reading some of the bizarre conspiracy theories that some Deputies came up with yesterday, even involving Donald Trump in all of this, which was one of the odder ones. A conspiracy theory is when you put two and two together and get 22, and there has been a bit of that, or when you join the dots and come up with a total fantasy. Conflation, of course, is where you take something related to a different campaign, like, for example, Creative Ireland, which was about local festivals and local arts events, and was a campaign that predated the SCU, and then assume it is the same for a totally different campaign. That is conflation.</p>

            <p eId="para_490"> I met representatives of a group of nationalists from civil society in Northern Ireland in Government Buildings on Tuesday, 27 February. I heard from the group their concerns about rights and equality in Northern Ireland and also discussed the current political situation in Northern Ireland and Brexit. I acknowledged the concerns of the group and pointed out that, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is cognisant of the concerns of all communities in Northern Ireland. I also emphasised the Government's unwavering commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and its determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions. I encouraged the group to reach out to civic unionism for cross-community dialogue on these issues for the benefit of all in Northern Ireland. I have also made clear that I am equally happy to meet representatives of civic unionism on a similar basis. Finally, I assured the group that the Government will continue to work with the nationalist and unionist communities, political parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government to support the formation of a new Executive, to further the peace process and to protect the interests of the island as a whole through the ongoing Article 50 negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_491"> I also met Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP, on 28 February in Government Buildings, along with Nichola Mallon. At the meeting we discussed the current political situation in Northern Ireland and Brexit. The SDLP outlined its concerns in the wake of the unsuccessful conclusion of the latest talks on Executive formation in Northern Ireland. I also had an opportunity to meet Mr. Eastwood in Washington last week, along with the Secretary of State and a number of other politicians who were represented there. I assured the SDLP of the Government’s continued commitment to working to support the parties, with the British Government, with the aim of having all of the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement back in operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_492">I very much agree with the Taoiseach when he says civic nationalism and civic unionism need to have a conversation and also that he would meet the group which drafted that letter from the civic unionist side of the public discourse. I think it is extremely important and very heartening that this initiative has been taken within the unionist community.</p>
            <p eId="para_493"> I met the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, on a recent trip to the United States. I am very sorry to report that, as yet, there is still no plan - not the outline of a plan, not the notion of a plan - coming from the Secretary of State, coming from Theresa May or, so far as I can ascertain, coming from the Government here in respect of those very issues that Colum Eastwood rightly raised with the Taoiseach around Acht na Gaeilge, marriage equality and legacy inquest funding, which are crucial. Civic nationalism is as one. The SDLP, Sinn Féin and others such as the Alliance, the Greens and People Before Profit are as one in demanding that these issues get sorted out. We cannot ask or suggest that everybody stands still because the DUP, unfortunately, and I do not want to get into recriminations, on this occasion, could not get the deal we struck over the line. It is not acceptable to say to people that, therefore, we freeze things.</p>
            <p eId="para_494"> I know the Taoiseach has called previously for the convening of the intergovernmental conference. I believe that is the framework within which those outstanding issues need to be named and a pathway forward identified. I think that can be done entirely within the structures and the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, and it is important that we protect the integrity of that agreement, as the Taoiseach knows.</p>
            <p eId="para_495"> It is good the Taoiseach is having these meetings but we can meet each other from here to kingdom come. At some stage we need to call it and we need a plan. What is the Taoiseach's plan?</p>

            <p eId="para_496">The SDLP has for a long time called for a British-Irish intergovernmental conference to be convened. I raised this issue yesterday with the Tánaiste and he indicated to me that he had raised this with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Has the Taoiseach raised the convening of an intergovernmental conference with the British Prime Minister and, if so, what was her response? As I said in statements on Northern Ireland in recent weeks, it would be a platform, for example, for both Governments to table the draft agreement that was virtually over the line with the parties involved in the discussions on the reconvening of the Executive in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> The two Governments, as guardians of the Good Friday Agreement, obviously have a responsibility to forge a path forward. Would the Taoiseach support the return of the civic forum for Northern Ireland that was created under the Good Friday Agreement in 2000 but which last met in 2002? The assembly voted to recall the forum in April 2013. It was proposed in the Stormont House Agreement in 2014 that a smaller civic advisory panel be established. Recreating it would, I think, provide a space for those in civic nationalism, as the Taoiseach has described it, and in civic unionism to have a forum to address some of the issues people are talking about in silos now.</p>

            <p eId="para_498">It was regrettable that the Taoiseach was not in a position to participate in full statements on Northern Ireland in recent weeks. His predecessors would always have contributed to such statements, especially at a critical moment in regard to the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> The evidence of recent days seems to be that the two Governments agree on nothing more than the general idea that it would be a good idea if the institutions were re-established. On two specific occasions the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have made public statements concerning what should happen next but, subsequently, these points have been rejected both on and off the record. Following last week's debate, the Tánaiste expressed support for the idea of changing the dynamic of the negotiations by making them genuinely all-party and potentially bringing in an independent chair. Does the Taoiseach support this, given I understand he did so at one stage? The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has said, however, that this should not happen and that it should be left up to the DUP and Sinn Féin to sort things out.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">In other words, it is the same strategy that has failed miserably in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste correctly supported the demand for the convening of the intergovernmental conference. However, it is being reported that the British Government is refusing to move on that demand. That suggests that, away from the banal generalities, the two Governments are at loggerheads on the basic strategy to resolve the issue, something that has not happened for more than 30 years. Does the Taoiseach intend to take any initiative on the matter? Will he insist on the negotiations being changed in order that all parties will have an input and that there will be an independent chair? At what point will he tell the British Government that it does not have the right to block the convening of the intergovernmental conference? What discussions has he had with Prime Minister May on the matter, specifically in the past three weeks? Why is there a growing divide?</p>

            <p eId="para_502">Does the Taoiseach agree with the suggestion of People Before Profit representatives in the North that, in the light of the political paralysis, we need a new civil rights movement to break the logjam and from the failed paradigm of green and orange politics? Since the civil rights movement that it tried to quell in the late 1960s and early 1970s, that paradigm has paralysed Northern politics. The issues that could break through it include extending marriage equality and abortion rights into the North. These issues cut across sectarian divisions, as does that of the Irish language. It is not the case that support for the Irish Language Act is limited to nationalists and Catholics. Growing numbers of Protestants are learning the language and support having such an Act. Should we not start to discuss building a new civil rights culture in which these and other issues could break through the failed paradigm of green and orange politics that is locked into the North's political structures?</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_503">From my conversations with people in my business in the North, I detect among civic unionism and nationalism, each of which is diverse - it is not fair to say anyone speaks for it; I would not agree with Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's claim to speak for civic nationalism because I do not think that is correct - and also among what I call the Agreement generation, people who were born after 1998 or who were too young to vote in 1998, a huge sense of frustration that the institutions are not working and that even when they were up and running, they were not really working in the view of civic society in the North. At least, that is my impression. There is huge frustration with all of the political parties in the North and a real sense that they are just not doing the people's business. It is so striking to see and I would not be surprised if we were to see falling turnouts at elections and so on into the future as a consequence unless there is some change.</p>
            <p eId="para_504"> What I intend to do more and more in my engagement in Northern Ireland is to talk more and more to civic groups, business, farmers, trade unions, campaign groups and also, in particular, younger people, the Agreement generation to which I referred. In that sense, I have some sympathy for Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's analysis that there are a lot of issues in Northern Ireland that transcend unionism and nationalism, orange and green. As I said last week in the United States, in the Library of Congress, it is my strong view that any right or freedom an Irish citizen has in Ireland or a British citizen has in Britain should also apply to British cand Irish citizens in Northern Ireland. Such rights include marriage equality and the recognition of native languages, as well as others. When I spoke in the Library of Congress, I set out what I thought should be the plan, that, after Easter, the two Governments - the UK and Irish Governments - should come together again to agree a joint paper or proposal, on foot of which they should have all-party talks. However, I am a realist, in that it is the case that the DUP represents a clear majority of unionist voters, while Sinn Féin represents 70% of nationalist voters. Therefore, there can be no agreement unless there is an agreement between these two parties. That is just the way the numbers stand. There is no meeting of minds with the British Government on this issue. The Tánaiste when speaking to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I in my last telephone conversation with the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May - I am not sure whether it was in the last three or four weeks, but it was recently enough - suggested the BIIGC be convened. While there has been no formal refusal from the UK Government, it certainly has not committed to doing so, which is a disappointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_505"> The political context is different - it is not the same as it has been for the past 30 years - and it is different for two very big reasons, the first of which is Brexit which has changed the climate and the weather around all of this issue, while the second is the UK Government has a confidence and supply agreement with the DUP at Westminster which does change the context. That is the reality of what we face, but by no means are we going to give up. We will keep pressing these issues. That is our solemn role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> On the civic forum, I have not given it much consideration, but I will give it consideration and certainly speak to the Tánaiste about it and seek his views.</p>

            <p eId="para_509"> I listened with interest to the Prime Minister's speech on Friday, 2 March - the Mansion House speech - in which she gave a number of important reassurances, including stating her overall goal of having a very close relationship with the European Union after the United Kingdom left. I particularly welcome her clear commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland peace process, the need to avoid a hard border and also the agreement reached between the United Kingdom and the European Union in their December joint report, over which she stands. Her speech included a number of signals about the type of future economic relationship there might be between the European Union and the United Kingdom, but it also recognised that the United Kingdom would have to face hard choices, given the constraints between some of its stated aims and objectives and the red lines it had set out, including departing from the Single Market and the customs union and rejecting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_510"> For our part, a close economic relationship and free trade are very much in the interests of Irish business, Irish citizens and public services, as is having a smooth transition period. I am concerned, however, that some of the constraints in leaving the customs union and the Single Market are not fully recognised on the UK side. Therefore, we will now need to see more detailed and realistic proposals from the UK Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_511"> I welcome the real progress that has been made between the EU and UK negotiating teams on the withdrawal agreement. The Government, as part of the EU 27, has pushed hard for sensible and practical approaches to citizens' rights, the financial settlement, the transition period and issues specific to Ireland. There has been progress on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. On Monday last the United Kingdom conceded that a backstop solution on the Border issue would form part of the legal text of the withdrawal agreement. It has also agreed that all of the issues identified in the European Union text will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution to avoid a hard border. Prime Minister May confirmed these agreements in her letter to President Tusk last Monday, in addition to reiterating the United Kingdom's commitment to agreements reached last December on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including the overarching guarantee to avoid a hard border.</p>
            <p eId="para_512"> Meanwhile, the Government has continued to work closely with Michel Barnier, whom the Tánaiste met as recently as Monday, the Commission task force and our EU partners as we prepare for the European Council later this week. I expect to see Prime Minister May at the meeting on Thursday. I also expect further guidelines to be agreed to by the Council to enable detailed discussions to begin on the European Union's future relationship with the United Kingdom. Progress on the recently published withdrawal agreement, including the Irish issues, will be important in the next phase of discussions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_513">I hope the Taoiseach will not continue the extraordinary and petulant line taken by the Tánaiste yesterday when he basically accused anyone who was questioning the Government of undermining the country. It has to be said there are very legitimate questions people have a right and duty to raise in discussing this issue. The Government's obsession with spin means that people are increasingly unwilling to take its claims at face value, which is an unfortunate consequence. The very direct issue is how the unagreed backstop text will be turned into a final text. Most non-Irish commentators have said Monday represented the kicking of the can down the road for a few months. The comfort of the Tory Brexit fanatics with what has been agreed to on Ireland suggests no significant progress has been made. Will the Taoiseach explain to the House the exact process between Friday and a final backstop text? Will he confirm that there will be no agreement to proceed to final status discussions until the final withdrawal treaty is completely finished, other than for the most minor of technical discussions? There is a real danger that the issue will be isolated down the road. Therefore, it needs to be brought to a head sooner rather than later.</p>
            <p eId="para_514"> On the east-west axis, people tend to forget that the east-west relationship is critical economically to the island, North and South. It is absolutely critical, not just in terms of the agrifood sector but also to industry, SMEs, the midlands and the west. There are times when the discussion takes place on Brexit and that dimension is not brought to the fore to the degree it should be. It is critical that we get the relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom right.</p>

            <p eId="para_515">I was going to raise the issue - it is probably better coming from me - of the tetchy response from the Tánaiste yesterday to a very legitimate question put by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Brexit. Those of us who are seriously grappling with every legal document, trying to be supportive of the Irish position and working as Team Ireland on this issue deserve better than that. The questions are legitimate. From what emerged from the discussions on Monday a view can be put on it that the European Union gave in to the United Kingdom on its position on the backstop, whereby the legal text drafted by the European Union interpreting its understanding of the December agreement was rejected by the United Kingdom. What we now have is an acceptance of the issue in principle by the United Kingdom but a legal text to be negotiated <i>sine die</i>. If one reads all of the background stuff - there are interesting articles in <i>The Guardian</i> today - there is real concern that in the context of the focus on the wider trade agreements, the Irish issue which the Irish Government included successfully in the phase one discussions will be more marginalised in the general discussion. When push comes to shove, there is a view among some commentators in Britain that the trade demands of the French and Germans and so on will at the end of the day ensure Ireland is pushed off its position. It is a very legitimate question to ensure we will keep our focus on what is important to us. I understand also the dialogue that there are some in Europe - the Taoiseach is very close to his colleagues in the European Council - who believe Theresa May's Government is hanging by a thread and that if they are pushed too hard, it will collapse. Therefore, it was important to cut her some slack last Tuesday. Perhaps that is the case and I will return to the issue in my pre-European Council statement later.</p>
            <p eId="para_516"> The east-west dimension which accounts for the bulk of our trade is as important as the North-South dimension. Both are critically important to the journey on which the country has been, economically and politically, in the past 30 years. We have to ensure we will not compromise it in whatever emerges. The Government has done a reasonable job, but it is also legitimate for us to continue to ensure our concerns will be the focus of the negotiating position of the EU 27.</p>

            <p eId="para_517">We are all concerned to ensure the European Union will hold the line in there being no hard border on the island and there being full protection for the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts. The indications are that our European partners understand this. Nonetheless, nothing is finished until it is finished and nothing will be achieved, in a legal sense, until it is written in a legal text and agreed to. There is a challenge in that regard. A worry I have is that periodically one hears from the British system some very far-fetched and outlandish technical solutions to have a frictionless border. Has the Taoiseach seen them off in the Government's dealing with Michel Barnier and the discussions he has had with Mrs. May? It reminded me a little of a motion passed at the last Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis which raised eyebrows. It was toll-free, M50-style crazy stuff-----</p>

            <p eId="para_521">The Europeans are very clear that they want to protect the Single Market which it seems trumps all else. Therefore, the stakes are very high for us. The British have not come forward with what they view as the backstop. I seek reassurance from the Taoiseach. I do not blame him for the inefficiency and the messing of the British system. It would be unfair to do so, but we have a legitimate expectation that he will keep the pressure on and hold the line. Have these technological wonderland musings been seen off? Have they been disabused of these notions?</p>

            <p eId="para_522">It is always legitimate for the Opposition to ask questions about the Government's work on Brexit. It is the job of the Opposition to ask such questions and I have no difficulty with it. I do not expect to receive blind support from it, either on the North or Brexit. I ask for support and those with influence at a European level, whether in their transnational party groups or other contexts, to use it. Parties have done this. I acknowledge that the party leaders represented in the House have done it in their contacts with MEPs and the respective parliamentary groups, of which they are members. I am grateful for this on behalf of the Government and the people generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> On the Irish protocol which essentially is the backstop, there will now be a process of talks which will involve the United Kingdom on the one side and Ireland and the task force on the other. The meetings have been scheduled and will occur in Brussels, which we think is the most appropriate place for them to occur. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and there will be no withdrawal agreement finalised until everything in it is finalised, including the Irish protocol, unless a better solution can be found in the interim. I have seen some commentary suggesting option A and option B, as I call them, have disappeared. They have not. It is still a possibility. It is still open to the British to come forward with option B and option A and if they do, we will examine them. It makes sense to talk about the final status and trade now. We should not agree by any means, but we should talk about the final status and trade precisely for the reasons mentioned by the Deputies. </p>
            <p eId="para_524"> The east-west dimension and the trade that occurs between Britain and Ireland are important to the economy, the agrifood sector, SMEs, jobs and many different things. We want to conclude a free trade agreement or better with the United Kingdom because it is in the interests of the economy, the people and jobs to do so. It is also possible that in coming to such an agreement we may be able to resolve or largely resolve the issues related to the Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. One of the things the British have put forward in some of their papers is a customs union partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">I do not know what the difference is between a customs union partnership and a customs union, but if a customs union partnership is something very close to a customs union, that would solve many of the problems that may arise between Northern Ireland and Ireland and we could have a bespoke arrangement to deal with the aspects that could not be solved. That is one of the ways it might go but it is impossible to predict at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_526"> The transition period will run until 31 December 2020. No changes will occur therefore until the first day of 2021. The UK has agreed, although this was not its position some time ago, that the <i>acquis </i>will apply during that transition period. The rules of the customs union and the Single Market will apply even though it will have no influence on or say in them. That is welcome because it gives public services, people and businesses the best part of two years to plan for any permanent changes that may take place. I acknowledge that it is very difficult to plan for permanent changes when we do not know what they are. That is why it is important that we conclude matters sooner rather than later.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> In answer to the final question, we have not seen any technical solutions from the UK Government that we consider workable. We have made that clear. We will of course consider any technical solutions put forward, but I refer to a report carried out by a committee of the Houses of Parliament which studied this again in detail. It has come to the conclusion that such technology does not yet exist and that is a solid conclusion.</p>

          <p eId="para_530">I will participate with my EU counterparts in a series of European Council meetings in Brussels tomorrow and Friday, 22 and 23 March. Before setting out the discussions expected at those meetings, I would like to say that I met Chancellor Merkel yesterday in Berlin. This was an important part of my ongoing programme of bilateral engagement with other EU Heads of State and Government, which has also included recent meetings in Dublin with Prime Minister Bettel of Luxembourg and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. All these meetings were particularly useful in advance of discussions at the European Council. My meeting with Chancellor Merkel was positive and constructive. We noted our very positive bilateral relations. We discussed a range of issues on the European Council agenda, including Brexit, trade between the EU and the United States and the tax challenges that arise from the digitisation of our economies. I also took the opportunity to congratulate the Chancellor on her election to office for the fourth time and to thank her again for her strong support and solidarity with Ireland. Both in her comments at the meeting and at the press conference afterwards, she was pleased to reiterate that support and to assure me that it remains "unconditional", to use her words.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> The European Council will meet in several formats over the course of Thursday and Friday. The main meeting tomorrow will focus on jobs, growth and competitiveness as well as external relations. In the evening, we will continue our leaders' agenda discussions as part of the debate on the future of Europe, with the focus this time on digital taxation. On Friday morning, we will meet in Article 50 format, without the UK, to discuss progress in the Brexit negotiations, followed by a euro summit at which we will consider how we can further and improve economic and monetary union.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> On Thursday we will discuss and adopt conclusions on jobs, growth, and competitiveness, including the Single Market, the European semester, social issues and trade. We will also discuss external relations, including Turkey and the western Balkans. The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee, will say more about these in her remarks. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mrs. May, will also speak about the nerve gas attack in Salisbury on 4 March. This was a reprehensible and loathsome attack and we stand in solidarity with the UK. We condemn unequivocally the use of chemical weapons and assassinations wherever they happen and whoever commits them.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> As Deputies are aware, the leaders' agenda discussions are intended to facilitate an open and free-flowing exchange of views on the future of Europe. These meetings are not supposed to produce conclusions but rather to unlock some of the more contentious aspects of issues on the EU agenda and to allow each of us to understand the others' positions a bit better. We have met in this format on three occasions when we discussed educational and cultural co-operation - that was in Sweden - migration, institutional reform and the multi-annual financial framework. The main focus tomorrow will be on digital taxation, an issue of broad international interest given the significant profits generated by multinational companies. It is important to emphasise that Ireland is committed to global tax reform. I restate that we do not accept that companies, including large digital ones, should pay little or no tax on their profits. Companies should pay their tax in full where it is owed and on time. However, we are very much of the view that global solutions are needed to ensure that tax is paid by companies where value is created and profits are generated, reflecting the highly international nature of the digital economy underpinned by the World Wide Web. Given the enormous complexity of the issues involved and the risk of unintended consequence should Europe act unilaterally and therefore hand an advantage to countries that are not members of the European Union, I will strongly argue that the EU should wait for the OECD to complete its work before deciding on how to act, and should only do so in the context of agreement on an international level. In saying this, I am very mindful of the interim report published by the OECD task force on the digital economy on Monday which highlights very well the potential risks attaching to a rushed short-term or interim measure. As the Secretary General of the OECD, Ángel Gurría, said, this is too important an issue to be rushed.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> As the House may be aware, the Commission published a set of proposals today which recommend a short-term temporary levy on certain digital activities, in advance of more extensive taxation measures in the future. I will be making clear my views that any such measure would be ill-judged for the reasons I have set out, and also because it would be likely to disadvantage smaller member states. We will, of course, continue to engage constructively within the EU and with the OECD in the period ahead. On trade, I expect that the Commission will brief us on discussions that have taken place this week on the United States' proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> On Friday morning, the 19 eurozone members will meet for a euro summit. The President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, and the eurogroup will be present. The focus will be on the economic and monetary union, EMU. This follows the euro summit in December when we tasked finance ministers to examine a series of issues around the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and proposals to develop it into a European monetary fund, the banking union and fiscal policy considerations among others. As a contribution to that important debate, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and his counterparts from seven EU member states published a joint paper on economic and monetary union, EMU, on 6 March. This set out a number of common values and ideas with the aim of building a stronger economic and monetary union. We do not expect that any decisions on this will be taken on this before June at the earliest.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> Finally, we will meet in Article 50 format to discuss the Brexit negotiations. As Deputies are well aware, this is an important moment in the Article 50 negotiations and it is hoped that we can agree guidelines on the future relationship between the EU and the UK. Last December, after difficult negotiations, the European Council agreed that sufficient progress had been made on the phase one withdrawal issues to allow the talks to proceed to this next phase. On this basis, work began on drafting the withdrawal agreement The first draft was published by the European Commission on 28 February. This text, which will be legally binding, reflects the principles and commitments agreed in phase one, including those on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, gains of the peace process, avoiding a hard border, and how this will be achieved. These have been set out in a dedicated protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is attached to the draft withdrawal agreement and has the same full legal effect. After intensive negotiations between the Commission task force and the UK over the past week, there has been good progress on some parts of the withdrawal agreement, including on citizens' rights, the financial settlement, and transition. Having a period of transition is important for public services, citizens and businesses to enable them to prepare for any permanent changes that may take place from 2021 onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">I am pleased that there is now broad agreement on these terms, subject to final approval, that the <i>status quo</i> will apply until the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. Regarding the protocol, I am pleased that the UK has now agreed that the backstop solution to avoid a hard border proposed in December will form part of the legal text and that all the issues identified by the EU side in the draft will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution to avoid a hard Border on our island. Prime Minister May confirmed this in a letter to President Tusk on Monday. As I have said before, and as Michel Barnier, the chief negotiator on behalf of the EU27, repeated on Monday, the backstop will apply unless and until another solution is found. So we look forward to receiving and considering the UK's detailed proposals in the coming weeks. Of course, it is fully accepted by Michel Barnier, the task force, the UK and our EU partners that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. We will continue to work very closely with them in the period ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> On the future relationship between the EU and the UK and based on the UK's stated positions, the draft guidelines for consideration by the European Council propose a free trade agreement. This, of course, would not strengthen the current economic relationship between the EU and the UK but it is an inevitable consequence of the red lines set out by Prime Minister May in her speech on 2 March, which are that the UK will leave the Single Market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. However, I welcome the assurance in the draft guidelines that the Union will enter negotiations on the future relationship with the UK with an open, positive and constructive mind. This is very important should the UK Government's position evolve further and red lines soften in the months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> We fully support and share the EU's view that any future agreement must have the correct balance of rights and obligations and that the integrity of the Single Market must be protected. This is very much in Ireland's interest as membership of the Single Market and its integrity are core elements of our economic policy. I hope that we can agree on Friday to open detailed discussions with the UK on the future relationship. At the same time, our British friends must fully engage on the draft withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. To that end, we have agreed on an intensive schedule of meetings starting next week. They will happen in Brussels and will involve the UK and Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_541">Gan amhras, beidh cruinniú na seachtaine seo mar cheann de na cruinnithe is tábhachtaí le fada. Tá sé tábhachtach don tír seo, don Eoraip agus do mhuintir an domhain ar fad. The run up to the meeting on Friday has presented a false sense of calm which is belied by the fact that none of the major items to be considered is anywhere near resolution. It has been indicated that the Council will note progress regarding the withdrawal treaty which will cover the period from March 2019 to December 2020. With regard to general issues, the current text effectively represents the UK Government facing up to the fact that in order to continue to have access to the Single Market and customs union during this period, it must respect the rules of the Single Market and customs union. Rarely before has so much time and energy been wasted on getting a government to acknowledge the blindingly obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> In the text released on Monday, there remain major gaps where there is no substantive agreement and the reality is that the Irish Border is the largest of these gaps. One of the casualties of the Government's obsession with spinning everything is that it is almost impossible to take it at its word any more when it comes to a political issue. It has shown itself incapable of acknowledging setbacks or unanticipated problems. As such, the declarations of happiness with Monday's agreement cannot, unfortunately, be taken at face value. Equally, the petulant aggression which has been shown to any party which has the temerity to question the Government on Brexit is now on daily display. We saw more of this yesterday when the Tánaiste made an extraordinary attack on Deputy Donnelly and my party. He claimed that we were undermining the Government and that "all informed commentary" agrees with the Government. This was followed by the equally bizarre claim that the Opposition was failing to consult the Government sufficiently. The Taoiseach and his Ministers, and I appreciate the comments of the Taoiseach earlier, would do well to understand that others are entitled to disagree with them. This remains a democracy and we have both a right and a duty to challenge them where we believe this is necessary. Equally, they do not define what is and is not a Euro-positive position. As Ireland's most consistently pro-EU party that has negotiated and campaigned for a strong EU for nearly 60 years, we will not be taking any lectures from people incapable of offering a confidential briefing or going beyond vague and self-congratulatory public statements. I would also point out that we have been signalling Brexit as a priority since the moment the British referendum was announced. We were pushing for preparations well before it commenced and we have been relentless in stating in both Great Britain and Europe the fixed political will of the overwhelming majority, which is that Ireland remains committed to a strong EU and that the rights and interests of Northern Ireland need to be protected. The Taoiseach should also look back and see that we were the first to point out the need to provide explicit, treaty-level protection of the EU citizenship rights of residents of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> The fact is that outside of Ireland, the overwhelming majority of informed commentary has said that Monday's deal represents a potentially dangerous kicking of Ireland's concerns down the road. The UK has reaffirmed that it supports the principle of a backstop. It has absolutely not agreed to the backstop sought by Ireland, which would involve the automatic continuance of Northern Ireland in the customs union and Single Market until we agree some other arrangement. No text covering the substantive content of a backstop has been agreed. Prime Minister May's letter confirms that she is committed to there being no east-west division in the UK. Equally, the DUP has said it is entirely comfortable with Monday's outcome, which is hardly something which inspires confidence given that party's very negative attitude to the EU's proposed text on a backstop. Substantial commentary has suggested that this marks a moment where Ireland is losing traction on the principle that there be no final status negotiations until a final status for Ireland is agreed. Reports from last week's meeting of the 27 suggest that many countries have already started raising their final status demands. We remain highly concerned that the Government failed to put forward any proposal for a special status for Northern Ireland early enough because of a misplaced belief that Ireland could force the UK to agree a major compromise on its overall relationship with the EU. This has now been dragged into a deeply unhelpful and destructive debate where it is being misrepresented as a threat to the agreed constitutional framework on this island and within the UK. Unfortunately we have yet to hear, publicly or privately, anything from our Government about how it sees option two working. Monday's statements suggest that our priority is to make the overall EU-UK relationship as close as possible thereby making option two or a <i>status quo</i> backstop unnecessary. How this might come to pass has not been explained even in the most general way. The background to this is continuing evidence presented to committees in Westminster that a no-impact Border is impossible to create if the UK as a single trade area leaves the customs union or Single Market.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> What we need is a lot more clarity and a lot less spin. What exactly is our Government’s bottom line? While it says it does not want a hard border, when will it give us a proper definition of what this means? Is it simply about the physical management of the Border or does it encompass wider regulatory issues? Will we block the withdrawal treaty later this year if it does not include the current proposed backstop? What is the process by which the enormous gap between the EU position and the UK position on the specifics of the backstop will be bridged? Instead of more short-term spin, it is long since past time when we need some clarity on these issues. Unless we get it, the suspicion will be that whatever emerges will be declared a victory irrespective of its likely divisive impact on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The summit will also address the issue of future steps regarding taxation, in particular digital taxation. Fianna Fáil strongly objects to the attempt to push forward a proposal on which even the most basic background work has not been prepared. There has been no attempt to outline its impact on member states. It is a headline, not a policy, and it fails to address any of the causes of economic problems in the eurozone or the Union as a whole. No member state would propose such a speculative measure within its own legislative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">It should be sent back to the Commission to be reworked in light of the OECD's work and not returned until an impact assessment is produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> On the wider economic reform agenda, it is the duty of the Taoiseach to explain here the full detail of what he appears to be signing Ireland up to. It has been reported that Ireland is against an expansion of the European Union's budget and is against a number of measures which would give the European Union some fiscal clout. It is also reported that we have aligned ourselves with countries which oppose some important elements of a true banking union. The truth of these reports is unclear because the Taoiseach has made no public statement on them and his normally hyperactive briefers have said nothing to journalists. He needs to deal with this before moving further and he should seek the legitimacy of a Dáil vote. We continue to believe in the need to expand the Union's budget, if necessary through a new dedicated revenue stream, and that addressing the causes of the eurozone crisis requires a more comprehensive set of reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> It is also reported that the replacement for Mario Draghi at the ECB is being negotiated. Mr. Draghi is the person most responsible for the recovery of recent years. Under no circumstance should Ireland support a candidate who opposed the policies which saved the euro and addressed the enormous errors which pushed Ireland and others into further difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> The summit will also respond to the murders and attempted murders of Russians in the United Kingdom. There is no credible doubt about who is responsible for this savagery. This is a defining moment for Europe and the democratic world. Will we defend the rule of law or will we allow an increasingly undemocratic and aggressive country to undermine it? While it is understandable that the UK's decision to turn its back on strong co-operation between European states causes real anger, we must not have any doubt that we stand with the UK on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> The response so far has been weak enough. Any proposal to reduce sanctions or appease anti-European Union aggression should be opposed. In this context, the Government should immediately reverse its resistance to Deputy Lawless's Bill to protect our elections and must significantly increase the resourcing to the Data Protection Commissioner. I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the position he articulated this morning and allow that Bill proceed to Committee where amendments can be proposed to facilitate its early passage. Because of the companies based here we have a responsibility to work with and for other European states in addressing this already real attack on democratic discourse.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">Since the Brexit referendum, Sinn Féin has argued consistently and vigorously for the North to be given a special status designation within the European Union. This is the only way to avoid the imposition of a hard border on this island and to ensure that our all-island economy and our peace agreements are protected. Special status means the North staying in the customs union and the Single Market irrespective of what the British Government might decide to do for itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> It is clear from Monday's meeting between David Davis and Michel Barnier that the British Government has accepted a significant portion of the EU draft agreement, which is to be welcomed. However, what remains unclear is the British Government's position on the so-called backstop on the Border. The British agreed to this in December. Subsequently the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, rejected that section of the draft treaty and we are now told that the draft treaty section is agreed but only in principle. What we need on this matter at this stage is clarity and certainty. Legal guarantees that what was agreed in December is the backstop will be put in place if there is failure to make a better deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> Sinn Féin's position is clear. As a minimum the backstop must secure the North's position within the customs union and the Single Market. The backstop is a bottom line and a deal on a transition period cannot be progressed without it. It is now up to the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and her government to bring forward credible and workable proposals as to how the imposition of a hard border in Ireland can be avoided. This will require a serious step-change from the Tories and the Brexiteers.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Let us not forget that these folks conducted their entire Brexit considerations and debate without once seriously considering the impact of Brexit on Ireland. They carried this dismissive attitude into the negotiations with the European Union. This arrogant attitude led to the fantasy of frictionless or seamless borders - makey-uppy Alice in Wonderland technological solutions. It also produced the ludicrous thinking that a border in Ireland would be like a border between two boroughs in England. Such nonsense will not cut it. That is an important cross-party message. It may be an important Opposition message because perhaps in diplomatic terms the Government cannot say that out loud, but I can and I will.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> If the British Government is serious about avoiding a hard border and is serious about minimising disruption to east-west trade, it must bring forward serious and appropriate propositions to match the scale of the challenge. The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and her government must resolve the four main contradictions in their approach to Brexit regarding Ireland. Let me set these out for clarity. How will Britain avoid the imposition of a hard border while dragging the North out of the customs union and the Single Market, as is its stated intention? How will the Good Friday Agreement be protected in all of its parts, especially given that there are 142 areas of all-Ireland co-operation that will be adversely affected by a Tory Brexit? How do the British plan to accommodate the democratic decision of the people of the North to remain part of the European Union? How will the British ensure that there will be no erosion of rights for citizens living in the North when Britain withdraws from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice?</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> On this issue the report from the North-South Joint Committee on Human Rights is an important contribution to the Brexit debate. Essentially the report recognises the need for special arrangements for the North post-Brexit. It addresses the threat posed to the Good Friday Agreement following Britain's withdrawal from the EU and from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This danger has been amplified by the dismissive political approach taken by the British Government to Irish concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> The prospect of the agreement being breached is very real and Sinn Féin has consistently highlighted the need for the rights of citizens in the North to be fully protected in any final withdrawal agreement. The Good Friday Agreement will not be put through the shredder because little Englanders are demanding their Brexit at any cost. North-South equivalence of rights, equality of citizenship and the protection of EU human rights legislation, guaranteed by the Good Friday Agreement, cannot be dismantled to suit the Tory agenda. Those who wish to access their rights as EU citizens in the North must be able to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Everything must be done to protect the all-Ireland economy. Members of the Government, especially the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, have a responsibility to ensure that the Tory Brexiteers and the DUP do not try to undermine what has been agreed. I have previously asked the Taoiseach to convene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. I believe that should happen as soon as possible. This is especially important to ensure that the rights of people in the North are defended in a way that realises the Taoiseach's pledge that citizens in the North will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_561">As the Taoiseach knows, Sinn Féin has given him and the Government a qualified support on Brexit. We do so because we genuinely want the best outcome for Ireland and for Irish citizens North and South. We have acknowledged a degree of progress made on a range of issues in recent times. That was down to the collective efforts of many people, including members of the Government, which we acknowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> While the draft plan published this week contains positives for Ireland, other elements demand a more critical reflection.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">First, while the agreement commits Britain to having a protocol on Ireland, it completely avoids the detail of such a protocol. It states "a legally operative version of the "backstop" solution for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Report, should be agreed as part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement, to apply unless and until another solution is found". However, it goes on to state, "There is as yet no agreement on the right operational approach". Therein lies the problem. We were told last November by the Taoiseach that we had a cast iron guarantee on the backstop agreement. The European Commission tried to put that agreement in a legal format. It did, but it was rejected out of hand by the British Government. The British Prime Minister said no British Prime Minister could agree to such an outcome. We were told this week that the British Government would agree to a protocol, but we do not know what protocol to which it will agree or what it will involve. That raises fundamental and profound questions about what exactly different people are talking about. When the Taoiseach talks about a backstop agreement and informs the House of what it means, it seems to be completely at variance with what Mrs. Theresa May and her Government are saying. That is the problem. While Britain agrees to the protocol in principle, it seems that it does not agree to it in practice. That is the current position. The negotiators have agreed to disagree in order to keep the negotiations on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Let us remember that there was always a fear in Ireland that the Irish issue would be parked. The other countries and the European negotiators, understandably, want to focus on the more thorny issue of a trade agreement between Britain and the European Union. While that is important, we cannot allow the Irish issue to be parked and cannot allow a fudge. The difficulty for all of us and the Government is evident. There is a fundamental difference between the political agreement reached last November and a legal agreement. When we try to move from a situation where we go from having a political agreement to a legal agreement and put it in legal text, we do not have any agreement between the European Commission and the British Government. I want to know how we will bridge that gap and what exactly is the position of the British Government. We are all trying to separate the spin from the British Government from reality. We know and are all conscious that the British Prime Minister has to manage different factions within her party, but we are also trying to understand what exactly is going on because the British position is very inconsistent. That raises questions for the Taoiseach in making sure we will achieve the best possible outcome. Notwithstanding the fine words about cast iron guarantees and what the Taoiseach has said in the past, there is no cast iron guarantee when they are juxtaposed with Mrs. Theresa May's speech a number of weeks ago and the stated position of the British Government that it cannot agree to the legal text as set out by the European Commission. While progress has been made, the Taoiseach has a long way to go. He should keep his eye on the big prize which in the final analysis is the final withdrawal agreement. That is on what we need to keep our eyes and if the Taoiseach gets the right result, we, in Sinn Féin, will support him.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_565">When the European Council meets tomorrow and Friday, it will be dominated by the discussions on a digital tax and Brexit. On Monday the draft text of the withdrawal agreement was published and it showed in a clear, colour-coded way in a very dramatic presentation on the big screen behind the Minister, Mr. David Davis, and Mr. Michel Barnier, how far we had to go. Three broad issues remain outstanding in advance of Brexit next March and the end of the transition period in December 2020. First, of central concern to us is the Border issue which remains intractable, as we have heard from many speakers. Alongside and separate from it, a framework must be developed for a future trading relationship. We are no closer to knowing exactly what form that relationship will take and whether it will include British membership of the customs union or a parallel customs union. This is of huge material importance to Ireland as ESRI research published today shows the expensive impact of tariffs on imports from the United Kingdom, with food products potentially costing Irish people up to €1,400 a year more. The most difficult and least remarked on issue is the need for a dispute resolution mechanism. This is also a concern for Ireland because, as it will influence whatever dispute mechanism is finally decided on, how any backstop agreement needed will be enforced or interpreted is an issue. The United Kingdom has ruled out the European Court of Justice as the arbitrator. If we are to have regulatory alignment, somebody will have to judge whether the rules are being applied properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> The clock is ticking and solutions will have to be found to these difficult problems. However, I acknowledge that progress has been made on many issues. Once approved by the EU 27 on Friday, the draft agreement will allow talks to be opened on the future trading relationship. This pivot on the future trading relationship has the potential, as I indicated during Taoiseach's Questions, to sideline Irish concerns about the arrangements on the Border. If it remains a sticking point in agreeing to a final deal, ultimately, when everything else has been agreed to, it is easy to see how Ireland will come under enormous pressure to relent to enable the national trade interests of member states to move to centre stage, something we have all been trying to avoid all along. The draft legal text does not address the continuing British objections to the current proposals from the Barnier task force and we are no wiser on what exact legal interpretation of the December backstop agreement is acceptable to Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> It appears that the United Kingdom wanted a longer transition period, longer than the 21-month period to 31 January agreed to. As I read it, there is no provision in the withdrawal treaty to extend the transition period if there is general consensus that such an extension is needed or desired in the event that there is no deal. The Taoiseach or the Minister of State might indicate whether it is possible to extend the transition period if it becomes an imperative in the next few months. Ireland wanted a longer transition period. Yesterday the Tánaiste spoke about a period of up to four years being required to conclude a proper trade deal. In effect, on Monday the European Union allowed the British to park discussions on the legal text of the backstop agreement for now. That issue will obviously have to be addressed in due course and probably by the June Council. The fudge cannot continue indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> While the so-called backstop technically remains in place, we have no practical written interpretation of it that is agreeable to both sides. As I said on Monday, Mrs. Theresa May agreed to it, ruled it out and then ruled it back in again. In any set of negotiations that does not and cannot inspire confidence. The lack of a reaction from the DUP and Tory Brexiteers highlights the win for the United Kingdom on that position, or at least the perception of the hard Brexiteers is that it is a win. I read today that 13 Tory backbenchers are signing a motion to demand a rejection of the transition deal. Apparently, the 13 have been joined by Mr. Sammy Wilson on the basis of an objection to the fisheries element of the deal. Apparently, they are to stage a protest tomorrow and dump fish in the River Thames outside the House of Commons in protest about the fisheries element, in other words, Britain remaining in the Common Fisheries Policy during the transition period. Apparently, the reaction of the Environment Secretary, Mr. Michael Gove, who is responsible for fisheries was to say that one should keep one's eyes on the big prize. The big prize is that it will be all right at the end of the day. These are just indications, from the Brexiteers' perspective, that Monday was a good day.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> The Irish Government will need to remain vigilant on this issue, as I am sure it will. The danger for Ireland is that there might be progress on all other issues, except our own, and that there will then be a shift of focus by some of our comrades and colleagues in the European Council. I accept that there is no sign of that happening, but it is certainly something we should not take for granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">On everything else, Britain has accepted the EU position lock, stock and barrel. The only concession appears to be in regard to the permission afforded to the United Kingdom to negotiate trade deals during the transition period, albeit without concluding them. However, it appears to be beyond the power of the British state to do that. Trade deals are lengthy and complicated and some of the big trading partners with which it would like to do deals, such as the Trump Administration, are not currently in the mood for agreeing benevolent foreign trade deals. It is for that reason that a Commons committee on exiting the European Union urged an extension to the transition period but, as far as I can tell, there is no provision for that in the deal so far. </p>
          <p eId="para_571"> The majority of the Europe Council will be focused on economic affairs, including discussions on trade, jobs growth, competitiveness and taxation. As the Taoiseach indicated to the House, there will also be a euro summit. In light of the move by the US President to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, we are potentially on the verge of a trade war which would involve the imposition of a series of tit-for-tat tariffs. It is unclear if the EU will be exempted from the American proposals, which have already been modified from what was first announced by President Trump. If the EU response is to place punitive tariffs on US imports, there is a possibility that Irish products such as whiskey or liqueurs will be impacted by a counter-tariff imposed by the US, which would be very bad news for Irish producers and the thousands of employees in the export-focused agrifood sector here.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> The proposals for a digital tax will also colour a possible trade deal. The US has made it clear it does not accept the EU position in that regard and is likely to see it as an attack on American companies. This is a very difficult issue for Ireland and on which Members have commented. Ireland has been very clear about its support for the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process. As the Taoiseach is aware, there was a strong focus on that while the Labour Party was in government. Ireland has been a leader in terms of that agenda and we must continue to ensure that our laws are best in class and fully transparent so that we dispel with a clear response the common perception that we are soft on this issue, which is raised every time I have discussions with European colleagues. My party has long argued for a standing commission on taxation along with a minimum effective rate of corporation tax, which would address many of the concerns of our European colleagues. However, a move towards an arbitrary turnover tax would cause great concern because it is, in essence, an additional spending tax which would certainly be of benefit to the large economies but would have a seriously negative impact on small economies such as Ireland. It would also undermine national competency on tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> I am conscious of time. The agenda will include discussion of the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights and the European Commission proposals for a European Labour Authority and I had hoped to have time to discuss those issues. I hope the Government will strongly push for an implementation plan in regard to the European Pillar of Social Rights. We must win back the support of working people for the concept of the European Union, which means impacting on their working conditions and living standards, and that is possible to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> I primarily wish to raise the matter of the very worrying things happening in Israel, both in terms of its treatment of Palestinians and its wider stance in the region, in particular in terms of Iran, which I believe should be discussed at the European Council but was not addressed by the Taoiseach in his speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> On taxation, without getting into great detail, it is extremely disappointing that the Taoiseach stated that the Government supports the moves towards reforming the corporate tax regime when everybody knows the situation is absolutely unacceptable in terms of tax avoidance structures in both the digital economy and some other big firms. A person contacted me recently in regard to Paddy Power, the C&amp;C Group and other companies that have subsidiaries in tax havens, yet the Government still holds out against tackling such practices. The Taoiseach has gone so far as to congratulate Donald Trump while in the United States for reducing tax on corporations. He essentially suggested that we have something in common with Trump's economic policies, which, to my mind, is pretty deplorable when one considers the agenda of the American President.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> The issue of Israel should be raised at the European Council. The Israeli admission in the past 24 hours that it carried out an attack in 2007 on what it claimed was a Syrian nuclear reactor is rightly being interpreted across the world as a very worrying warning of a ratcheting up of the situation and a possible threat against Iran. The logic is that the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the American President, Donald Trump, wish to dismantle the nuclear arrangements with Iran and this admission of a previous attack suggests that they are willing to engage in military attacks if Iran is developing any kind of nuclear capability. That is very worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> That must be considered alongside the Trump and Netanyahu axis in terms of the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, which is a direct insult to the Palestinians, and also in the context of a series of United Nations reports in recent weeks that show a very serious ratcheting up of illegal settlements by Israel in east Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank. One of the reports suggests that children have been most affected by what is going on there. Hundreds of children are being held in administrative detention without trial or having been convicted of anything. Twelve members of the elected Palestinian Legislative Council are in prison. Parliamentarians are protected everywhere else in the world but in Israel those representatives are rotting in prison. Nine of them are in administrative detention without having been convicted or tried. The UN is not a radical left wing think tank and we should take what it says seriously. It has stated that Israel is flouting UN resolutions at every level and is denying services to Palestinians in areas it is annexing in east Jerusalem and in the expanding settlements in Hebron. It has further stated that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is reaching emergency proportions.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> Nothing is said or done and no action is taken by the European Union. If any other country took such actions, there would be outrage and condemnation but we say and do nothing and continue to treat Israel as if it is any other state while it essentially threatens other states in the region with military action, which would be a disaster, is doing unspeakable things in terms of its treatment of Palestinians and is becoming more aggressive, bold and audacious in its actions, all of which are encouraged by Donald Trump. Are those matters of concern to the Taoiseach or the European Council? Does the Taoiseach think we should be saying anything about them? Does he think the European Union should impose sanctions on Israel, which keeps edging forward in its blatant disregard for the most elementary provisions of human rights law, UN resolutions or respect for civilised behaviour in the region or world?</p>

          <p eId="para_580">I wish to raise the drive to integrate Ireland into the process of European militarisation and, secondly, the attacks on democratic rights in Europe and its trading partners. We have repeatedly raised the issue of the drive for further militarisation by the European Commission and core European countries. The next goal, as clearly set out in its White Paper, is the European Defence Union. Two weeks ago, at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, Commissioner Oettinger agreed with me that the plan is to triple spending on so-called defence in the next multi-year budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">It is clear that the Government is committed to going along with that, as indicated by its signing up for PESCO. The Government has responded to that repeatedly by saying there is nothing to see here, that here is no process for Ireland participating in European militarisation. That said, I encourage people to read the discussion document from Fine Gael MEPs entitled, Ireland and the EU: Defending our Common European Home. Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, made a pre-emptive attack on the far left for criticising the paper. He accused us of using "populist rhetoric". I do not wish to use any populist rhetoric, I want just to quote from the document I think he wrote. He said that "if the outcome to the current debate on the European Defence Union leads to some form of mutual defence pact within the EU, we should be prepared to consider that on its merits", that is, consider joining a European military alliance. The MEPs call for a redefinition of the concept of Irish neutrality, saying the term "independent non-nuclear defence" might be a better way of describing our position, one that is open to active engagement in international security operations but non-militarily aligned. It is short step from that to joining NATO. The MEPs also call for an amendment to Ireland's triple lock system, an increase in defence spending and the development of Ireland's defence industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> What this is about is perfectly clear. It is about making it easier for Ireland to go to war. It is about Ireland participating in a Defence Union and a mutual defence pact in the European Union. It is about spending more money on weapons of destruction and killing rather than health, education or housing, and making Ireland a profitable centre for those peddlers of death. That is not populism, it is not rhetoric, they are the facts and people should check out the paper to which I referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> The second issue I wish to raise is what is being referred to now as the so-called democratic recession, namely, the attacks on democratic rights which are taking place globally. The European Union is well able to make points about the lack of democracy, often correctly, in other countries or countries with which the EU has conflict or tension. However, democratic rights are under attack right here in the European Union. At the forefront of that process is what is happening in the Spanish state. The whole world saw the brutal response of the Spanish state to the attempt by the people of Catalonia to exercise the right to self-determination, but it is not just that. Let us look at the events of recent months. On 20 February, a rapper, Valtonyc, was sentenced to over three years in prison for <i>lèse majesté</i> and "glorifying terrorism" in his lyrics. Another rapper, Pablo Hassel, has been sentenced to two years for "glorifying terrorism". Other singers have also been prosecuted, not for any acts but for the expression of their views. Every copy of a book criticising the Partido Popular, PP, has been sequestered. Twitter users have been prosecuted for glorifying terrorism. That is the latest manifestations of a Francoism by the Spanish state to crush any attempt at dissent. We saw the unprecedented feminist strike on International Women's Day when there was a tsunami of millions on the streets. Up to 6 million people turned out, which shows the enormous discontent that exists and the potential to overthrow Rajoy and to get rid of the attacks on democratic rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I wish to raise the case of Brazil, given that the trade negotiations with Mercosur are due to be discussed. There has been an horrific deterioration of democratic rights since the parliamentary coup which brought Temer to power. There has been an increase in state repression and in violence against those who oppose the Government. The latest victim of an horrific incident was Marielle Franco, a councillor for PSOL, the socialist party in Rio, who was assassinated. Nine bullets were shot into the back of her car, bullets which were sold to the police in Rio. She was a black LGBTQ activist and a very prominent activist for human rights. As in Spain, the response has been for tens of thousands of people to come out on the streets, standing up bravely against the repression.</p>

          <p eId="para_587">While the agenda relates mainly to jobs, growth, competitiveness and taxation, which are all very important, I find it very strange and disturbing that they are going to dominate a meeting when we have such horrific humanitarian crises in the world, some of them involving European countries directly, and in certain ways they involve all European countries. Then there is Syria, where there has been war for seven years. We see incessant bombardment and more and more displacement of people, including a displacement of refugees. We have had very graphic images, in particular of children, many of whom have been born into violence. The most graphic image in recent days was of a young man who was obviously both physically and intellectually disabled, being helped from that war-torn area. It appears Syria is not even on the agenda of the European Council. Other trouble spots include Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar and Libya. Europe could do an awful lot more and it could be stronger in terms of engaging in building peace-promoting initiatives in those areas. The UN has shown itself to be ineffective on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> We all signed up to the sustainable development goals but not one of them can be achieved in a conflict zone. Sustainable development goal No. 16 relates to peace and justice. There is a discrepancy between what we are agreeing on paper and what we do in reality. Europe is supposed to be liberal but it is under threat from reactionary forces both inside it and outside. The European motto is supposed to be “united in diversity” but what we are seeing is a Europe and a world that are increasingly more divisive. The lack of unity is especially seen when it comes to refugee policy. Where is the commitment to the Geneva convention on the protection of refugees?</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Trade, jobs and taxation can change that. Many of Europe's economies are also struggling themselves from decisions made during the financial crisis and there is unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, and increasing wage disparity. Trade and taxation decisions made in the EU affect countries in the global south and the developing world. We have seen the disastrous effects on countries in Africa as one example of taxation decisions by the EU. The reality is that international tax rules and decisions are keeping people in poverty in those countries and in continued inequality so we need to do more to look at the way tax is being paid and the way in which tax is being collected.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> We said that we will address issues that cause migration such as war and conflicts but economic inequality also drives people to leave their countries of origin, so when we are discussing jobs, competitiveness, taxation and trade what importance will be given to the impact of those EU decisions on countries in Africa and other similar countries? I heard what the Taoiseach said earlier about global tax reform and ensuring payment of taxes and I hope we will see action on those, not more rhetoric.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> It is opportune to remind us of the report recently published by the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the national plan, human rights and business, which is about promoting responsible business practice in keeping with the protection of human rights globally. In the foreword the Tánaiste makes a commitment to the two being complementary, namely economic growth and trade and human rights. That is the challenge and we will see what happens at the EU Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">I echo the points made by Deputy O'Sullivan. I regret that the EU is not elevating more the issue of Syria and the role being played by Israel at present in the Middle East, not least the recent announcement of Israel's expansion plan into 40 km of the Golan Heights, effectively annexing another chunk of Syria, with the help of al-Qaeda allies, the Golan Knights, who have been appointed as border guards. When it is not exploiting the horrific slaughter in Syria to grab more land for itself, the fact that Israel is flagrantly breaching Syrian sovereignty is absolutely appalling. The head of the Israeli airforce recently proudly boasted that it had carried out thousands of missions in Syria in the past year alone. None of the attacks was carried out in response to military action emanating from Syria and none could be justified as legitimate self defence. They were all in flagrant breach of international law. As a neutral country we should be raising those issues in the EU. In that context the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, was very helpful last year when a group of Irish citizens was deported from Israel in September 2017. Sadly, last weekend two other Irish citizens were again deported from Israel. They were part of a group of 22, mainly Irish people, who landed in Tel Aviv on a flight from Istanbul on the evening of Friday, 16 March. They wanted to take part in a study trip meeting Israelis and Palestinians and to see for themselves what was going on in the area. Most of those people had never been to that country or area before. They ranged in age from 20 to 80.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Some of them were planning to have St. Patrick's Day celebrations in a refugee camp in Bethlehem. Sadly, they were intercepted at the airport in Tel Aviv, held for seven hours and subjected to massively aggressive questioning. Two of those citizens were deported, having spent over seven hours in a dirty room with no natural light or fresh air. Appalling newspaper articles appeared about those people claiming that they had been in Palestine previously, that they had taken part in violent protests and so on. They had never been to Palestine previously. One was a young Kildare mother of two small children and the other a young man fulfilling a lifetime dream to go to the area and meet people, and they were deported. We offer hospitable contact to Israelis coming to this country. The least they could do is afford the same respect to our citizens who go to their shores. I expect the Government to be raising these points with our peers in the EU.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_594">Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq by US military forces, facilitated by the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. Since that time, the use of Shannon Airport has been facilitated by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and now this Government of Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance. It is a very sad tale. As someone writing about the issue this week pointed out, the invasion of Iraq was not just a catastrophe and a shambolic disaster; it was also a crime. Whether they like it or not, history will judge poorly the politicians of the various parties in Ireland who have facilitated the use of Shannon Airport for the destruction of Iraq and other countries since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> When Ministers go to Europe, I get the impression that they do not really challenge the unquestioning support for the US military machine. We do not seem to be overly concerned about the fact that 17 million people in Yemen currently lack food and 6.8 million are at risk of famine. The horrific scenes taking place in that country beggars belief but I am not convinced our Government is raising it as a serious issue of concern, whether it is the EU support for the Americans' involvement in the region or the direct role of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, UAE.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> The EU is seriously preoccupied with the role of Russia in Syria. The number of people in this country who have bought into the mainstream media agenda where Russia, Iran and Hezbollah are the real criminals now that Ghouta has been bombed is mind-boggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Myself and Deputy Clare Daly were in Damascus a few months ago where bombs were exploding every five minutes. Most of the car bomb attacks in Damascus and the constant shelling across the centre of the capital for the past four years have come from Islamic forces in Ghouta, especially from the Duma district. That is hardly surprising. Only last week, Robert Fisk was writing about this and he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_598">Here are some cruel facts about the sieges of Ghouta. They have become buried in the real rubble and blood and the sham and apocalyptic expressions of horror from the West.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_599">Yet how can we complain when we will not ourselves deal with the armed Islamist opposition to Assad ... </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_600">After all, we've been arming these people for years!</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The west has armed Al-Nusra. It has armed al-Qaeda, and it has added dramatically to the incredible slaughter that has taken place in Syria. The Irish Government might actually raise the issue that if we want to stop the horror of what is going on in Syria, it is time to talk to all sides.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">I too am happy to speak on this issue. I note from the agenda highlights issued by the European Council that the spring focus will be on economic affairs. Heads of State or Government will also look at a number of the other pressing issues, including taxation and foreign affairs. Finally, EU leaders will also discuss Brexit. That is strange. I would have thought we would demand that Brexit be at the top of the agenda because it is coming ever closer like a train on autopilot and we do not know where we are on it. It is all over the shop, so to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> I imagine that the results of the recent Italian election will also play a significant part in the discussion, even if the great and the good of the European project have been uncharacteristically silent about its results. Will we continue to get these results or wallops, as the Minister of State's former leader called them but as European institutions are talking about now, before we sit up and take notice of the terrible disconnect between ordinary citizens and the European institutions, more so the heads of those institutions?</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> We have seen in the Italian election how, once again, the majority of the people have expressed deep-rooted frustration with the entire European political process. It is a timely warning and we should sit up, listen and try to make sure we address that because we are sleepwalking. The Italian people believe, as do many in Europe, that they are isolated from the agendas set out by the likes of those in the European Council. That is what it is, and other speakers referred to it also. There is a huge disconnect and also abject poverty in Italy and people do not believe they are in any way supported or that their lot is improving. That is not to mention the refugees. I am talking about ordinary families and small business people who believe they have been left behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> This is a radically dangerous path for Europe to follow. Italy is not on the fringes of Europe. It lies within its very heartland. Towards the end of the British empire when England was at its weakest, we were stuck out off the west coast of Europe and saw the impact of that. This vote has taken place in the very heart of Europe. If the people of that great state are sick and tired of the disconnect between their lives and European policy pushers, that is incredibly dangerous news for us all. That is what the result has thrown up. How many more warnings do we need?</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> The European Continent is all too aware of what happens when Europe becomes a fragmented and divided landscape. We need to take note of that also. As we know, Italy featured in the top 15 of Ireland’s top trading partners in terms of Irish export sales, that is, countries that imported the most Irish shipments by dollar value during 2017. That is a serious issue and we need to be cognisant of it, address it and not have us undermined in that regard. Irish trade with Italy is estimated to be worth $2.9 billion. That is a huge amount of trade. In light of that I hope the leaders at the European Council will heed the messages that are coming from the great state of Italy because inevitably we will be affected by any obstacles to trade imposed on us by those on the European mainland. It is very important to wipe our eyes and look honestly at what is going on, and I am not talking about the Minister of State or the officials, and recognise this for what it is. There should be no back-slapping and saying that everything is great, we are doing fine and the European project is hunky-dory. Clearly, it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> What are we going to do about the huge crisis in Europe with the refugees? What are we going to do about the situation in Syria, which is diabolical and has been going on for many years? There are millions of refugees, displacement and Israel is bombing the hell out of the place whenever it feels like it. We seem to be silent on those issues. We are a neutral country. We are meant to be always proud of our neutrality, but we seem to be acquiescing now with what the big boys in Europe want. We want to be the good boys in the class.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> I appeal to the Minister of State to do her best to let her voice be heard from this proud Irish nation. I will pass over to Deputies Michael Healy-Rae and Danny Healy-Rae.</p>

          <p eId="para_609">I express my appreciation of the consistent engagement and work of the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs. All members of the joint committee very much appreciate her involvement and hands-on and workperson-like approach. She takes her job very seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> We have reached a juncture where the future of the European Union is at stake. We can talk about Brexit forever and clearly we must deal with the problems and issues arising from it. However, we must also be conscious of the need to formulate a plan of work for how the remaining European Union member states will perform, interact, work and trade with each other. From now on, people want to hear what type of European Union we will have post-Brexit and where it will take us. This applies to farming because farmers are struggling - smaller farmers, in particular - finding it extremely difficult to make a living and to trade and export, given our reliance on trade with the United Kingdom. It also applies to the Border and Northern Ireland in general, including the paramount importance to the future well-being of the country of safeguarding and maintaining the peace process. </p>
          <p eId="para_611"> When we look around the rest of Europe, we see problems, including the results and aftermath of elections in various countries. Where will this place us in the future? The respect Ireland has earned internationally is very important. The country's excellent reputation is the result of the people we exported, if Deputies will excuse my use of that word. Aunts and uncles of mine left the country in the 1950s and made their way in other parts of the world. We must recognise them because it was they, not politicians, who earned respect for the country. Those who worked abroad, made their way in business or took jobs in different sectors of society made our name on the European and world stages. We will all work together for the future of the European Union and Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important matter. Brexit is a major concern in my constituency, especially among those living in rural parts of County Kerry who depend on farming. Small business owners are also worried about what will become of them after Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Significant expectations were created before Christmas with regard to the border with the North. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade suggested the matter had been sorted out and that there would not be a hard border. People are not sure what happened and whether it was Britain or the European Union which had sold the story to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste because they surely did not make it up for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> Brexit is of critical importance and we need to find out how it will materialise. We certainly do not want to return to the days of a hard border. Many people are sad that the Border was not mentioned in the recent talks between the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, and the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk. The way in which the Border issue will be addressed has been left to very late in the day. That is the big question and I ask the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to do everything possible to ensure we will not end up with a hard border. It is difficult to see how it can be avoided. However, given that we were told before Christmas that we would not have a hard border, I ask the Government to ensure we have will a soft border. As I stated, it is of critical importance to small farmers and small businesses who deal with people in the North that Brexit not affect or hurt them.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">This is an extremely important moment in the history of Ireland. As we find our former friends and allies in Washington and London drifting off in the direction of economic nationalism, we must reassert our place in Europe. Last week's events in Washington will be as important as the meeting of the European Council later this week. The controversy surrounding remarks made by the Taoiseach in Washington last week does not only revolve around the issue of trying to ingratiate ourselves with President Trump regarding Doonbeg golf course. Of equal or perhaps greater significance were some of the Taoiseach's other comments and the manner in which he, on behalf of the country, sided with the Republican Administration. He did do so in his American dream speech, in which he took a gung-ho approach to individualisation and the misguided direction in which the United States had moved. However, he also congratulated President Trump on adopting Irish corporate tax policy, which was a deeply mistaken approach that will haunt us in our negotiations with our European colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> The traditional argument we have made in defence of our corporation tax policy has been that it is necessary because Ireland is a peripheral country in an isolated location without an industrial past. This line was used to justify a differentiated corporate tax system. However, to use this argument to justify President Trump's tax break for his rich friends undermines our case and promotes what can only be viewed as a global race to the bottom in terms of the percentage of corporation tax paid. This approach is not in our interests and places us in a bad position for the forthcoming European Council meeting at which the key issue will be whether the European Union should adopt the OECD's approach to taxing digital monopolies or take immediate action in this area. The comments made by the Taoiseach in Washington will hinder our arguments and capabilities in the debate at the weekend and were, therefore, a major mistake. </p>
          <p eId="para_617"> We must start to review our position. The Green Party very much welcomes Ireland's connections with the United States. US companies have been extremely beneficial in developing the economy and are very welcome in this country. However, there is a fundamental injustice in the world. My colleagues in the European Green Party, including Philippe Lamberts and others, have carried out detailed research in this area. They estimate that Europe is losing approximately €1 trillion in unpaid corporation tax as a result of improper avoidance. We must remedy this problem. Notwithstanding the Taoiseach's comment that we do not "accept that companies, including large digital ones, should pay little or no tax on their profits," the truth is that that is what is happening. These companies are not paying 12.5% corporation tax but 1% or 2%. We cannot prevaricate or stop every initiative from our colleagues aimed at addressing this matter. The issue will come back to haunt us.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> Our negotiating position has been weakened in the sense that in seeking a good Brexit deal - by and large, our European colleagues are showing great solidarity towards Ireland - we are being bad on climate change. I have just attended a meeting of the Select Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment at which I asked the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, to state whether he supported the European Parliament's proposal to increase the target for renewable energy from 27% to 35%. The Minister made clear that we were not in favour of the proposal. Ireland is in the low corporation tax, high carbon, get-everything-we-can school of economic nationalism, which is not a clever position to take at this time. We will be caught out at some point and the goodwill towards us will be undermined by this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">People can read the Taoiseach's speeches the same way I can and we will be seen as being closer to Donald Trump's Washington than we are to our colleagues in Europe, which is a real shame.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I take a slightly different position from my Fianna Fáil colleagues on the Brexit aspects of the Council meeting. I listened to Deputy Donnelly's comments yesterday and my instinct is that at this moment it may not be a bad thing for us just to pause slightly for breath on the Border issue. It is not that we should undermine or change our basic strategy, which has been the right one, but it is about thinking ourselves in some depth about the nature of the protocol and the east-west relationships that we must maintain. That will have a consequence on the North-South issues. If we can minimise the east-west disturbance between Ireland and Britain, it makes it much easier to get a North-South agreement. By having a singular focus on the North-South aspect, we may detract from that task.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Taking a pause for thought and not being centre stage in every single debate on Brexit just for the next few weeks would also give us the chance to look at the nature of the deal going through. Colleagues of mine are today echoing what I believe Mr. Nick Clegg, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said in arguing that we should be very careful that we do not just buy into a deal that gives us a customs union connection with the North but does not give us the same conditions as Single Market access. From my understanding and the briefings we have had with the Department, the protocol we have does not give us Single Market status on the island. We may need to strengthen it. For that reason it makes sense to consider it.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have done a very useful service in the sharing of information on how these negotiations are going. I was very taken in listening to the some of the commentary on where we are with the withdrawal agreement. The likes of Ms Patricia King from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions made the very valid point that the nature of the deal that is starting to take shape is one that does not include strong labour and environmental standards. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, might correct me on that. It is my recollection of some of the conversations I have heard in this regard. It goes to my earlier point that we cannot just see the world filtered all the time through the eyes of economic and short-term trade interests and not take into account the need for environmental and labour standards. That seems to be the way the UK is going and it is willing to sacrifice everything just to get some sort of mythical ability to form trade deals.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> To restore some of our reputation as a country that helped negotiate the 17 sustainable goals in New York and which has an interest in some of the big environmental and economic justice challenges of our time, we should be looking to see how we can stitch into any exit or withdrawal agreement some sort of maintenance of environmental and labour standards. That is where it is at its weakest. We have a particularly valuable role to play because we can and should have a good relationship with the UK Government in this regard and we have such strong cultural and familial ties. I have ten first cousins in the UK and we are not going to give up on them or connections with friends and relations on that island. For a range of cultural as well as economic reasons, we more than anyone else should be using this period to work with the British as best we can, as deranged as they seem to be currently. We must see what environmental, climate and energy standards can be worked on with the British. It should be the same with our colleagues in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> The Taoiseach is never here for the closing statements on the European Council meetings. I know he has a busy diary. I was taken by what he said when I asked him recently who he has spoken to in the North. He divided Northern politics into a top and bottom five. The Green Party is in the bottom five and nobody in the Government speaks to it because it just deals with the sectarian politics. The Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and Sinn Féin are effectively the only people listened to or spoken to. That is not working and it needs to change. By speaking with the likes of my colleague, Mr. Steven Agnew, in the North, the Government might get a connection with people from the unionist tradition to whom we must speak. It should not just be about the DUP and Sinn Féin. The Government could speak to Deputy Paul Murphy's colleagues in the North as well. Why is it that this Government is just buying into the idea that there are two types of politics and that we speak to the sectarian parties but forget about the others? That needs to change.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">I thank the Deputies for all their contributions. As the Taoiseach indicated, I will focus my remarks on the external relations items scheduled for discussion tomorrow in Brussels. I might touch on the fact that a number of Deputies have raised matters not on the agenda. The spring meetings always tend to discuss jobs growth and competitiveness and it is important for that tradition to continue, as such areas are of the utmost importance for member states, citizens, our economy and standards of living. At the same time, issues relating to Syria, Israel, Palestine and Africa are being raised by Ireland through the foreign affairs committee and in other formats. They are certainly on the agenda at a European level and we will continue to engage on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The European Council is expected to discuss Russia. This was expected in any case, given the fourth anniversary of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea on 18 March, but at the request of the UK, the European Council is now likely to discuss and adopt conclusions on the nerve agent attack that took place in Salisbury on 4 March. It is something that I discussed with colleagues at the General Affairs Council and, for the most part, there was condemnation of such attacks. Ireland utterly condemns this reckless attack and we are at one with European partners and other member states in offering solidarity with the UK and supporting its efforts to ensure a thorough investigation so the perpetrators of this heinous crime can be held accountable. The use of chemical weapons, including the use of any toxic chemicals as weapons by anyone anywhere is unacceptable and abhorrent. The attack in Salisbury is not just an act against the UK but an affront to the international rules-based system on which we all depend. The UK has concluded that it is very highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack and it has announced a series of measures in response. There is a very clear onus on Russia to address all the questions that have been raised about the attack in Salisbury, including providing full and comprehensive disclosures of the Novichok programme to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The European Council will also discuss and adopt conclusions in advance of an expected EU-Turkey meeting in Varna on 24 March, where the EU will be represented by the Bulgarian Presidency, the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission. Ireland recognises the security concerns of Turkey after the 2016 attempted coup, but we are disappointed that Turkey's relationship with the EU remains under significant strain. Together with our European partners we have voiced our concerns about negative developments in Turkey with respect to human rights, freedom of expression and democracy, and the rule of law. There are also tensions in the eastern Mediterranean and we reiterate our call on Turkey to act in accordance with international law and respect the sovereign waters of its neighbours. It is fundamental to ensuring a positive climate in the region, not least so negotiations for the establishment of a comprehensive Cyprus settlement can resume. Ireland's overall position on Turkey is that the lines of communication must be kept open, and this was again stressed and reiterated by the Commission yesterday. Our view is the EU's continuing engagement is in the interests of the Turkish people, and to this end we support the 24 March meeting at Varna between the EU and Turkey.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> On the western Balkans, the March European Council will also adopt conclusions ahead of the EU western Balkans summit, which takes place in Sofia on 17 May. The three main deliverables foreseen for the summit will be the reaffirmation of the European perspective of the western Balkans region, an enhanced engagement on connectivity, and an enhanced security partnership. The objective for the March European Council is to discuss the summit in these terms. Separately, the European Council will confirm that enlargement will be addressed by the Council in June. Ireland is a strong supporter of the accession of the western Balkans states. We welcome the Commission's strategy for the region published in February. I have visited Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in February. It was an extremely useful and engaging visit. We will work with the Bulgarian Presidency to ensure the summit in May is a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> I thank all Deputies for their statements today. The Taoiseach will report back to the House on Wednesday, 28 March on discussions at the European Council. A few questions were raised. Deputy Howlin raised the issue of the withdrawal agreement and the extension of a transition period. To my knowledge, there is nothing specific in the withdrawal agreement to extend the transition period past 31 December. The Commission has said it will keep this under consideration closer to the time. The issue of connectivity or connectedness between citizens was also raised. This is why we are having our Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Europe meetings. I ask all Deputies to engage in the process and encourage their constituents to engage also.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> On discussions in the North, I attended meetings recently where members of the SDLP, Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, and members from all political parties were in attendance representing the various council borders. I also engaged with different representative groups from industrial areas as well. We are engaging with as many groups as possible, and not just in the political sphere but outside of it as well</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> On the future framework and areas of the environment and other issues, it is important to note that a lot of this will fall into the future framework and what that looks like. I hope we can begin discussing that in greater detail after tomorrow's European Council meeting. However, I take the Deputies' comments into account.</p>

            <from>Deputy Frank O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_633">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the issue of Garda resources in north County Kildare. I also thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, for coming into the House to take this Topical Issue which is a major concern to the people of County Kildare. I am looking forward to discussing it in a constructive and positive way in the knowledge that the Garda College in Templemore was closed until 2014 and that the confidence and supply agreement includes a commitment to bring Garda numbers to 15,000 by 2021. While the Minister has no direct input in the allocation of Garda resources in my area, as a public representative, this is the forum in which I have to raise issues of concern to my constituents. It allows me to bring a focus to the issue and use this mechanism to send a strong message to the Garda Commissioner that the required resources to help the Garda do its job in County Kildare should be allocated. That is the framework in which I have raised this Topical Issue in the hope it can be progressed in a positive way.</p>
            <p eId="para_634"> I acknowledge the gardaí who are doing their duty in my constituency, particularly when they are under-resourced owing to a lack of numbers. In County Kildare the ratio of gardaí to population is 1:680, while nationally it is 1:450. The ratio in County Kildare, therefore, is well below the national average. One of the largest towns in north County Kildare, Celbridge, has a population of 22,000 but only 11 gardaí and no full-time Garda station. At one stage 22 gardaí were based in the town. This brings difficulties to the area and it is also the case in many other places such as Maynooth, Clane, Leixlip and Kilcock which are growing and developing. Garda numbers need to grow and develop with them to keep up with demand. If a Garda station is not operating effectively, it takes longer for gardaí to respond to, say, a burglary or a road accident. It is important that these towns and areas have a good Garda base to provide security for the people and businesses located in them. We are not suggesting County Kildare is a crime black spot. However, it is close to the suburbs of Dublin. I am highlighting the lack of Garda numbers in the hope they will be increased to assist in the good policing work already being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> Maynooth, a university town, has a population of 15,000 and over 12,000 students but no full-time Garda station. Clane and Kilcock each has a population of 6,000, but their Garda numbers are seven and ten, respectively, and there is no full-time Garda station in either town. Whatever Garda management does with its resources is a matter for it; I am here to have extra gardaí allocated to these areas to have a better policing presence which is so badly needed in these communities. There are additional resources in Leixlip and Naas because they are the locations of Garda divisional headquarters. The figures are skewed because gardaí are allocated to the drugs unit and the traffic corps. While the numbers of gardaí may be higher than in other towns in north County Kildare, they are not actually in a position to do the day-to-day community Garda work required. Overall, we need increased numbers to bring the ratio of gardaí to population in County Kildare closer to the national average of 1:450.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_636">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. The distribution of Garda personnel and resources generally is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner as the allocation is based on a range of factors, including assessed policing needs based on crime trends and Garda intelligence. I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel assigned across the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures optimum use is made of resources and that the best possible policing service is provided for the general public.</p>
            <p eId="para_637"> I acknowledge and welcome the approach taken by the Deputy in this debate. It is his entitlement as a public representative for the people of County Kildare to raise the issue with me.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">I wish to assure him that every consideration will be given to the very valid points raised in the course of this debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the overall strength of the Kildare division as of 31 January 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, was 357, a 14% increase on the number at the end of 2015. Of particular interest to the Deputy will be that the strength of the Leixlip and Naas Garda districts increased by 28% and 9%, respectively, over the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_640"> When appropriate, the work of local gardaí in the Kildare division is supported by a number of Garda national units, such as the armed support unit, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. The Deputy will be aware that the closure of the Garda College in 2010 and the moratorium imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all divisions, including in Kildare. Since the Government reopened the college in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda Síochána and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 85 to the Kildare division.</p>
            <p eId="para_641"> I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, to provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017, a net increase of more than 600 since the end of 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce. This year 800 Garda trainees will enter the Garda College, 200 of whom have already entered since January. A further 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest this year, with more than 200 graduating from the Garda College just last week. I am pleased to say this continued investment will bring Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, to 14,000 by the end of 2018. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Garda Commissioner to provide additional resources across all divisions, including in Kildare, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. The investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda Síochána. A total budget of €1.65 billion has been provided to An Garda Síochána this year, an increase of 2% on last year.</p>

          <speech by="#FrankORourke" eId="spk_268">
            <from>Deputy Frank O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_643">I acknowledge the additional gardaí who have come to Kildare since 2015 and the percentages quoted by the Minister, which I accept. The point I was making is that, even at that level, they are probably replacing others and the numbers are probably not growing at the rate we would wish, given the gardaí coming in are dealing with the work of gardaí who are being transferred or are retiring. Notwithstanding all of that, proportionally Kildare still has 40% fewer gardaí than any other part of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> It is with this in mind that I have raised the issue of a reallocation or redistribution of resources to Kildare to help bring increased Garda numbers to the areas I have mentioned until more gardaí come through training in Templemore. We are aware of the vacuum that has to be filled and we are aware that it is going to take time, which I acknowledge. I am simply asking if a redistribution of resources can happen and if more gardaí can be brought to Kildare while we are waiting for those qualified gardaí to come through.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> This would be important because, even with all the figures the Minister quoted, which I accept, we are still 40% below the national average and we still have a ratio of one garda to 680 people, whereas other parts have one garda to 450. With a reduced number of gardaí, there is reduced visibility, a reduced presence and, obviously, reduced policing, which has an impact. The more gardaí there are, the better the visibility and presence, which gives everyone a sense of positivity. In those key areas I have mentioned in my constituency of Kildare North, there is a need for extra resources over and above what the Minister has mentioned. That is why I am asking for a redistribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> The Kildare local economic and community plan 2016-21 identified 15 Garda stations in full-time operation in Kildare, the second lowest rate of Garda stations per 10,000 head of population nationally. Kildare also has the lowest rate of gardaí in the country, with 15 gardaí per 10,000 head of population. That was the point I wanted to bring to the Minister to see if gardaí can be reallocated to Kildare to help deal with the issue I have raised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_647">I assure the Deputy the issue of the distribution of resources is kept under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all appropriate factors, including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual area. It is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division as appropriate. I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that recent census data is being incorporated into the personnel allocation model. I understand that census information received on a specific county format is amended by the Garda Síochána analysis service to reflect Garda divisional boundaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> I take on board the point raised by the Deputy in regard to the situation in the university town of Maynooth and the fact its population increases for some part of the year, which means this area of north Kildare may represent a special feature. I assure the Deputy I would be happy to raise that specific point with Garda management.</p>
            <p eId="para_649"> On foot of a commitment in the programme for Government, the Garda Síochána Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, is carrying out a review of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda Síochána in the delivery of policing services to local communities across Kildare, as well as throughout the country. The review will be comprehensive and includes a consultative process with local communities. It will also take account of the changing environments in rural and developing urban and suburban areas, and the allocation and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> I assure the Deputy this issue will be looked at in the context of the allocation of resources by the Garda Commissioner. I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this important matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Ryan<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_651">I am disappointed by the slow development of much-needed school provision by the Government. In my constituency we have towns which are under serious pressure for mainstream school places at primary school level and it is becoming a crisis, with serious problems in Swords, Balbriggan and Donabate. Today, however, I am speaking directly to the problem of school places in one particular school. St. Michael’s House special school in Skerries is at maximum capacity in a building that is not fit for purpose. I am raising this matter today to impress on the Minister the urgent need to get the site acquisition process completed as soon as possible and for the new building for St. Michael’s House to be delivered without any further delays.</p>
            <p eId="para_652"> In the previous Government, of which the Minister and I were a part, and under Labour Party Ministers, we prioritised the provision of new schools in the worst of economic times. In 2015, I brought the then Minister, Deputy Jan O’Sullivan, to St. Michael’s House in Skerries to see for herself the current building and how inadequate it is to meet the needs of the pupils. She recognised the need and the Department officials recognised the need but the prioritisation of the provision of new schools has been too slow.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> I need a definitive answer to two questions in the Minister's response, and if they are not in his prepared response, he might please add them in advance of his reply. First, is money set aside to complete the purchase of the new site? Second, is money set aside to fund the construction of a new school building and will it go ahead without further delay once the site acquisition process has been completed?</p>
            <p eId="para_654">The principal, staff and pupils and their families deserve answers to these questions. They deserve a timeline for this to happen and I hope that, in his response, the Minister will provide that.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> The current building is unfit for purpose. The school has been housed there for 36 years and, unfortunately, the building is well past its use-by date. I have visited it several times. The mounting level of repairs needed just to keep the building in basic condition is financially onerous. The school received prefabs in recent years due to the poor state of the building and the benefits are acknowledged by everyone involved, but these are not long-term solutions and are merely putting the finger in the dam.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> The school is at maximum capacity. There is no more space for any increase in the student body. Currently, pupils are only admitted when an existing pupil finishes his or her time at the school. With a maximum capacity of 30 pupils supported by 17 dedicated staff, the number of spaces that crops up is small. For the next academic year, there will be six spaces created by departing pupils. There are 21 applicants for these six spaces and, as such, 15 pupils and their families will be disappointed. I know some of those families personally. It is my understanding that no pupils are due to depart the following year, so no new places will be available. With a new building, St. Michael's House could increase its service provision to 92 pupils, thus trebling its current number. What a transformation that would be.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> This vital service is desperately needed in north Dublin generally. From the time St. Michael's House was born in 1955, it has helped to change fundamentally how we as a country educate people with intellectual disabilities. It has been a leader in the development of community-based services for people with intellectual disabilities, providing services to 1,751 children and adults. St. Michael's House has demonstrated exceptional leadership throughout the years, but if it is to deliver its vital service, it requires assistance from the State in the form of a new building and facilities worthy of its staff and deserving of its pupils and their families. The school community needs certainty. The time for being unclear is over.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_271">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_658">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I acknowledge that the investment in school facilities has been an important feature of recent years. I assure the Deputy that we are sustaining the high level of building. Indeed, we have completed over 200 new schools, comprising more than 120,000 additional places. In terms of financial provision, almost €8.5 billion will be provided for investment in schools under the recent ten-year plan. This level of funding is unprecedented. We are committed to providing for children. Ireland is unique, in that no other European country has the same pressure of a growing school population that we do. The Deputy rightly acknowledges that meeting this increasing demand has been a challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> St. Michael's House special national school in Skerries was established in 1982. Enrolments are stable, with 30 pupils enrolled in the 2017-2018 school year and a staff allocation of a principal plus five special class teachers. The school is located in a rented building with temporary accommodation in Hacketstown. My Department is committed to providing a permanent accommodation solution. In that regard, a project to deliver a new school building for St. Michael's House special school on a greenfield site has been included in the Department's six-year capital programme. It is planned to provide a new building to accommodate a 14-classroom school, expandable to 16 classrooms, covering classes for pupils with mild to general learning difficulties, autistic spectrum disorder, multiple disabilities and severe to profound disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_660"> My Department is working closely with Fingal County Council in accordance with the memorandum of understanding on the identification and acquisition of a suitable site to facilitate the school buildings project. The site acquisition process for this school has been ongoing for some time. Initial efforts were focused on acquiring land in the vicinity of the school's current location, which was preferred by the school authorities. However, efforts in that regard were unsuccessful and the current site option was subsequently identified. The acquisition process was paused for some time while my Department engaged with the school authorities regarding potential alternative accommodation that was available at the time. Based on the outcome of that engagement, the site acquisition process recently restarted and negotiations with the relevant landowner are at an advanced stage. I confirm that a potential permanent site option has been identified and is being progressed. My Department, with the assistance of Fingal County Council, is engaging with the landowner. There are some clarifications required on technical issues regarding the development of the site, and this assessment process is nearing completion. Once there is agreement on the terms of the site acquisition and technical queries are clarified, it is anticipated that the conveyancing process can be advanced by the respective solicitors.</p>

            <p eId="para_661">I thank the Minister for his response. I have been working closely with the school in recent times, so I am aware of the various developments and reasons for delays, but I cannot emphasise strongly enough how stretched the school is. Pupils cannot take their required breaks. There are also pressures on space from a staff perspective, which has a direct effect on how well they can deliver their services to the pupils. St. Michael's House is a special school and, as such, has special requirements unlike mainstream schools, but these requirements are not so special that an inordinate delay should occur. We have acknowledged the source of some of the delays.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> Will the Minister grab a hold of this issue and help get it over the line as quickly as possible? He should not be reluctant to spend public money on this service. The public in north Dublin want and value it. It would also benefit the Minister's constituents, given its location. The public in north Dublin want to see investment in this service regardless of whether they will be direct users. The Irish are a compassionate people who want to see our fellow citizens treated equally and fairly.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> The staff in St. Michael's House are a credit to the teaching profession and to the public sector in general. They are being inhibited from doing their job to the best of their ability by the inadequacy of their building, but they are not the real losers. The people who lose the most are the pupils. They are not getting the facilities they deserve, facilities that would allow them to thrive and fulfil their individual potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> We need to see progress on this as soon as possible. Will the Minister please give me direct answers in his supplementary reply? Is it the case that, once the acquisition process is completed, money will be available to finalise the purchase of the site? I understand from the Minister's reply that the acquisition process is at an advanced point, but will he make a commitment that, once it is over, he will move swiftly on delivering the building, which has been in the programme for some time? He referred to a six-year programme, but this is urgent. Not only would we be improving facilities for current students, but the potential in opening up additional places would be of tremendous value.</p>

            <p eId="para_665">I assure the Deputy that money is not a constraint on meeting this requirement. Delays can be frustrating for schools, but there are always delays in site acquisition, particularly in Dublin where site availability is scarce. It can take time. There can also be frustrations with the planning and design processes and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> I assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to this school. It is a priority, as the Deputy stated, and its development will provide the Department with new capacity, which will be fully utilised once made available. No effort will be spared in trying to progress the situation. It is an important project for us.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_667">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for debate, which I have submitted for discussion because the Department Education and Skills has clearly and shamefully overlooked the applications made by a number of secondary schools from counties Sligo and Leitrim that were seeking to participate in a new pilot scheme for the provision of leaving certificate physical education.</p>
            <p eId="para_668"> The House may be aware that, during 2017, the Department sought applications from secondary schools across the entire country that were seeking to be included in the new programme. Following on from that notice, 360 schools applied. Of those, I have been advised via a parliamentary question this week that only 80 schools have been selected for inclusion in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">If those 80 schools were spread across all the counties of Ireland, there would not have been a major problem with certain schools not being selected. However, of the 80 schools that were selected nationally, not one secondary school from either Sligo or Leitrim was selected to be included. I find it absolutely shocking.</p>
            <p eId="para_670"> Following the Department’s decision to overlook the applications from Sligo and Leitrim schools, I took the opportunity to speak with a number of disappointed principals from my constituency in order to discuss whether or not their applications had been strong enough and to gauge their feelings about not being selected by the Department. Of the schools I visited, the applications I saw were outstanding and the principals in question are now furious over the entire selection process. The schools now want answers about how the process was decided on, by whom and on what criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> The fact that large schools such as Summerhill College in Sligo and Sligo Grammar School were overlooked for the scheme by the Department is quite simply astonishing, considering their strong and proud sporting traditions and their record of achievement at national and international level. No consideration was given by the Department to using geographic location as a criterion when selecting the 80 successful schools. That should be called into question and needs to be looked at in further pilot schemes by the Department for Education and Skills. The people of Sligo and Leitrim have as much right as the people from every other county to expect fairness and equality when decisions are being made by central Government. These two schools in particular have amazing sporting facilities and dedicated and leading sports programmes. They have sports teams competing across a wide range of sports at national level and at Summerhill College, there are five PE teachers. How could that be overlooked for the purposes of the scheme? </p>
            <p eId="para_672"> As a public representative for the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, the situation of the schools was highlighted when we learned that Donegal had eight schools selected and Limerick had seven, yet poor old Sligo and Leitrim did not have one school selected between them. I welcome that Coláiste Cholmcille in Ballyshannon has been included, which is part of the south Donegal area of my constituency. It is important to note that parents who had expected that Sligo and Leitrim would at least have one school included for 2018 are now beginning to ask questions of the schools that had applied and are questioning the standards and types of applications that were submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> Does the Department consider it to be a fair approach? Who sat on this steering group and how did it make its recommendations? There is no mention of a broad selection of school type.</p>

            <p eId="para_674">I thank Deputy McLoughlin for raising the issue. I will clarify a number of things. It is not a pilot scheme; it is phase one of a model that will go countrywide from 2020. It is a testing of a concept that has been developed by the NCCA of a new physical education curriculum, both an examinable curriculum at leaving certificate and also a framework for students who choose not to do the exam. It was not a contest to select the best schools in the country for a pilot scheme. It was, by contrast, a need the Department identified in order to make sure the programme is delivered to the highest possible standard to get a range of schools across a range of different needs, including DEIS and non-DEIS schools, single sex and mixed sex schools, small and large schools and so on. It was not a contest to select schools with particularly strong sporting traditions and put them into a pilot scheme to demonstrate the excellence of the project. Instead its purpose was to prove the concept and to have schools that are perhaps not as strong or do not have as great a tradition and to have a mixture of schools. I assure the Deputy that we aim to provide it on a nationwide basis in September 2020. It is one cycle of students going through the programme to complete the leaving certificate senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> As the Deputy indicated, it was massively oversubscribed. We had 369 applications for 80 places. There is a huge appetite for this. It is something we are really keen to get right. The two years between this coming September and the nationwide delivery will be used to make sure we deliver quality continuing professional development to prepare teachers to deliver the programme with the new curriculum and the new examination model. The way it is being done is very exciting - video material is being included as part of the examination process. It is a period in which we are proving the concept, which is extremely strong. The design was done entirely independently by a steering group set up - it was chaired by my Department - to ensure we got the best test to prove the concept and make sure we ironed out all the glitches that might occur in the delivery of a curriculum such as this. It is an exciting new project. I assure the Deputy there was no ill-reflection of any applicant. There were wonderful applications we were not in a position to include in the first phase but which will be included when we go countrywide with the project.</p>

            <p eId="para_676">I thank the Minister for his response. I am still baffled that there are eight schools in Donegal and seven in Limerick. It is a pilot scheme over the next two years with 80 schools included but there are very few in the north west, particularly in my constituency. That may not be what the Minister set out to do but he has a responsibility to ensure the members of the board look at it on a geographical basis. How can the Minister justify there being seven in one county, eight in another and none in others? It is not acceptable. I accept the Minister's point but parents, teachers, PE teachers and various other people are looking at the situation in fine schools in Sligo and Leitrim and are not convinced that what has happened in this case has been fair.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> It is only right and proper that we get the system right. I welcome it because it is a first and it will be of huge benefit to many students all over the country. It is vitally important we get it right and do not discriminate against certain areas of the country. That is what is happening. When I speak to teachers, students and parents, they are very confused, worried and disappointed by what has happened in my constituency.</p>

            <p eId="para_678">I understand what the Deputy is saying. If it was being allocated on the basis of giving every county a fair shot and one county was being left out, the Deputy would rightly feel aggrieved, but that was not the approach. It is a model that will go countrywide. What we are trying to do in the first phase is get a selection of schools across a range of school types to ensure we have ironed out any glitches and that we have the right sort of professional support for teachers and that if we discover or identify weaknesses that we improve the professional support team that is in place. It was not an attempt to pass judgment on the quality of the applications. We accepted schools that were in a position to participate which might not have been schools of sporting excellence in an area. The schools have been independently selected. The purpose of the selection was to ensure we road-test in as effective a way as possible the 80 schools, the frameworks - the leaving certificate examinable and the framework that is not being examined - to make sure we are in a position to deal with any challenges it throws up. What has been done is entirely independent. There has been no direction of any sort given to the steering group. It has made the selection to best deliver the objective of the curriculum development.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">I have to stand over the quality of the work being done despite acknowledging that the Deputy has misgivings about what has happened. It was done in the best interest of having a nationwide quality PE programme in place from 2020. </p>

            <p eId="para_680">Last week the Government managed to set another record: 714 citizens were left on trolleys. I did not think that, even under the stewardship of this Government, it would get that bad. I believed that, as someone who has a fair amount of experience of the health service, I was unshockable but the Government has managed to shock even me.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> Last Monday, the general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_682">We saw record trolley figures last week with a total of 3,112 in just one week and today each daily total from that week has been surpassed by the extraordinary figure of 714 admitted patients on trolleys today... This upsurge was predictable and the INMO warned against inaction or insufficient action in the wake of Storm Emma. It is unfortunate for both healthcare staff and patients that these warnings were not heeded and that emergency measures sought have not been put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">It is unfortunate for health care staff and patients that these warnings were not heeded. We see yet again a predictable crisis. </p>
            <p eId="para_684"> The Government has blamed the flu, the patients, the staff and I am sure now the Minister of State will blame the storm. The truth is there is a lack of capacity within the system. This year there has been a bed capacity review and the passing of a Sinn Féin motion detailing measures that will make an appreciable difference but we have not seen any action on either of these events. There is a state of emergency whereby elective surgery and planned procedures are cancelled but all that does is store up problems for later in the month or the year. We would like to hear from the Minister of State what exactly the Government has planned to deal with a very predictable crisis which has now become a perpetual crisis.</p>

            <p eId="para_685">With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, once again the Minister for Health has not showed up. This is my thirteenth attempt to get him to respond to this topical issue matter and four times I have asked him to respond to a similar question. He has not turned up on any of those occasions. That is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> I have tabled many questions on the University Hospital in Limerick but I do not seem to get answers. Today 64 people are on trolleys in Limerick. There were 66 yesterday. Last Monday there were 80 and in February almost 1,000. There will probably be more than 1,000 in March and there is no solution in sight. In recent months 13% of those on trolleys have been in Limerick University Hospital. It is a new hospital and before it was opened I tabled a topical issue matter because the nurses in the INMO were concerned that more than 24 people would be on trolleys there every day. At that time another Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, deputised for the Minister whose excuse was that he was at the hustings to elect a new leader for the party. Deputy McGrath said: "there is no basis for any suggestion that 24 patients will be accommodated on trolleys in the new emergency department". Unfortunately, now we almost wish it was only 24 because every day there has been more. What Deputy McGrath said is completely untrue. In 2018 there have been only two days when there have been 24 or fewer on trolleys, 22 and 23. The core problem in the hospital stems from the merger of Nenagh, St. John's and Ennis accident and emergency departments into one so-called centre of excellence in Dooradoyle in Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> We know that a 96 bed project will be delivered in some years' time. What will the Minister do in the meantime? Additional beds should be opened immediately in Ennis, St. John's and Nenagh.</p>

            <p eId="para_688">I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> Emergency department, ED, overcrowding has been linked to many adverse outcomes, such as longer wait times, worse patient outcomes, treatment delays and growing staff and patient dissatisfaction. That is why this Government is committed to breaking the cycle of overcrowding in our health service and has again provided significant funding this winter for measures to relieve pressure on our EDs. This winter has been a particularly difficult one for our health services. During February, there was a 7.7% increase in ED attendances and a 5% increase in ED admissions, compared to February 2017. There was also a 9.5% rise in ED attendances and an 8.5% rise in admissions among those over 75 years of age in February, as compared to the same period last year. This increased demand was further exacerbated this month by the impact of Storm Emma and related severe weather across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> This growth in demand is well ahead of population growth and reflects international evidence that emergency department demand is driven by more than demographic factors. However, inpatient bed capacity to meet the growing demand is constrained, resulting in an 11.8% increase in patients waiting on trolleys compared to February 2017. As part of budget 2018, €40 million in additional funding has been provided to respond to winter pressures, of which €25 million has been ring-fenced for social care measures to reduce delayed discharges and improve patient flow from our EDs. These measures are being rolled out and include €3.5 million for 20 additional transitional care beds and €18 million for 45 additional home care packages a week in the system during the winter period.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> In addition, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, recently approved a further €5 million in funding to deliver an extra 324 home support packages, HSPs, across 13 specific sites and an additional 50 approvals per week for transitional care beds, TCBs, for a six-week period across all hospitals to support hospital discharging in the aftermath of Storm Emma and associated adverse weather. Among the sites to benefit are Tallaght, St. James's Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, the Mater and Beaumont. As of today, approximately 190 additional beds have been opened this winter at St. Vincent's, Drogheda, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Beaumont, St. James's Hospital, the Mater Hospital Dublin and Naas Hospital. Further beds are already funded to come on line throughout 2018, including new beds in Kilkenny, critical care beds in Cork and the Mater in Dublin, and as part of the development of a modular build for South Tipperary General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_692"> While acknowledging the need for productivity improvements and reforms across the health service, the recently published health system capacity review outlines that in order to reach international standards of bed occupancy level, the acute hospital system needs additional beds front loaded. In response to this recommendation, the Minister has asked the Health Service Executive, HSE, to develop a plan to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system which can be opened and staffed by this November to improve preparedness for winter 2018-19 and relieve overcrowding in our hospital EDs. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to develop this plan as a priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> We all wish for a better health service and improved hospital services. It is only through continued investment in capacity, in hospital staff and in reform of our health services in line with Sláintecare that we can deliver this. I assure my colleagues that this remains a priority for this Government and we will continue to work hard and stay focused on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_694">I left my crystal ball at home but I did not need it because I could have predicted that the Minister of State would blame the storm and make a nod towards the staff, patients and disease profile. There is a real lack of accountability and sense of responsibility for this problem. The Minister of State does not have to take my word for it. The INMO publishes the figures. After seven years of Fine Gael in government the problem is getting increasingly worse.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> When Fianna Fáil was in government 469 people on trolleys was declared a national emergency. Fine Gael has picked up that ball and run with it fairly enthusiastically surpassing the Fianna Fáil figures to reach 714 which is nothing short of disgraceful. The Minister of State did not acknowledge that. The transitional care beds and the investment are all to be welcomed. The Government does not need another bed capacity review or another report from the HSE. It can see that if there are 485 people on trolleys we are short 485 beds. That is very simple mathematics.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">The Minister of State cannot dress this up or hide behind statistics. The simple fact is he has managed to preside over a health service that is not an attractive place for people to work in. Nurses, doctors and allied health professionals will tell one that. They tell me that. The Minister of State must be aware of that. There is a crisis in recruitment and retention, which is leading to a crisis in capacity, and there are no answers coming from the Government. I have been to the print room and have seen people from the Minister of State's party. They are voting no confidence in his ability to sort this crisis out. They are printing leaflets to give to their constituents to advise them on how they can get treated abroad. That is a vote of no confidence. They have no confidence that this will be improved. Judging by the words just uttered by the Minister of State, I would have no confidence that he has any plan to improve this. The plan is blame the weather and in the meantime, ask the HSE to devise another plan. It beggars belief.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">There is nothing in the Minister of State's response that I have not seen before. There is nothing in his response that helps anybody in Dooradoyle who is on a trolley. As I said earlier, we have the worst trolley crisis in history. It has been ongoing for years in Limerick. I think I will be standing here next year talking about the same thing. Nothing in the Minister of State's response will help people. We hear about how it is sometimes so overcrowded that the relatives of elderly patients on trolleys are not allowed to stay in the accident and emergency department so they have to leave before their relative is even admitted. We heard today that they do not get any hot meals while they wait and some are waiting for 20, 30 or 40 hours. A huge number of these people are older people. I need far more than the Minister of State's response and I ask that he forward my comments to the Minister with the request that the Minister stop ignoring my emails to him and arrange a meeting with me to discuss this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_698">I wish to clarify that I certainly did not blame patients, staff, the system or the weather but the facts are there. I know Opposition Deputies are not always interested in engaging with the facts. Soundbites and headlines make up easier discourse in which to engage but the facts are there. There are underlying challenges and I was merely outlining those challenges and the steps that are being taken to deal with them. A total of €100 million was put into the winter initiative this year. This is a fairly significant investment by any standards. It was designed and designated merely for access measures made up of €40 million for winter measures, €10 million for waiting list measures and a further €50 million for the NTPF for waiting list initiatives. This is not small change by any standards. A total of 189 additional beds have been opened this winter. Clearly, it is not enough but we are not going to open 721 beds. One does not open beds based on the number of people waiting on trolleys on any one day. We need a review and to look at capacity and where the pinch points are. It is not just a case of clicking one's fingers and opening beds so, of course, the HSE has a job of work to do to identify the issues. That is how systems are run and that is how an organisation like the HSE has to perform. It has to produce a report and carry out analysis. A total of 189 additional beds have been opened this winter. The Deputies opposite may not wish to hear this but some very significant steps are being taken towards alleviating the winter pressures. I had no difficulty in acknowledging that there was an 11.8% increase in the number of people waiting on trolleys this February compared with last year so we have no issue with accepting and acknowledging the challenges and there is no desire to hide from them. Of the 189 beds, 22 new beds have been opened in St. Vincent's University Hospital, 25 have been opened in Drogheda and 17 in University Hospital Limerick. These are new beds that have been opened this winter. This winter, 28 new beds have opened in University Hospital Galway, 19 in University Hospital Waterford, 20 in Beaumont Hospital, 23 in St. James's Hospital in Dublin, 24 in the Mater hospital and 11 in Naas General Hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_729">I am pleased to introduce the Fianna Fáil motion on business insurance. We are calling for urgent action from the Government to tackle rising insurance costs for businesses, particularly SMEs. I acknowledge all those in the Public Gallery who are directly affected by this issue. I thank Deputy Moynihan for the work he has done in highlighting this issue within the party and demanding that we take action.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> The overall message for the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is that this issue must be a priority for Government. There is an enormous amount of anger and, indeed, frustration at the lack of progress in dealing with rising insurance costs. The Minister of State may talk about reforms that are due and being prepared for 2019 and 2020 but they are of no comfort to businesses that are struggling today and do not know how they are going to renew their insurance policy because they simply may not be here in a year or two years. This is also an issue for sports clubs, voluntary groups and community organisations. It is seeping into so many different strands of Irish life.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> The increases in insurance premiums are dramatic for many businesses, particularly those in the retail and hospitality sectors, in particular pubs, restaurants, hotels and nightclubs. We do not have any CSO data unlike motor insurance but we have many real-life examples. I have heard so many of them. In the past couple of years, one business's premium increased from €10,000 to €25,000 while that of another business increased from €18,000 to €31,000. The premium for a large hospitality business like a hotel or nightclub could increase from €80,000 to €230,000. That is the reality. </p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Those are just the changes to premiums. There are also changes to excess levels and exclusions are increasingly included in these policies. In many cases, the excess can be €10,000 to €20,000. Of course, it is very easy for an insurance company to make an award of up to the excess level because that is paid by the policyholder and not by the insurance company. There are many instances of exaggerated and downright fraudulent claims being settled instead of being challenged. This is what is happening in reality. There are cases where policyholders have pleaded with the insurance companies to contest and challenge claims only to find out that a payout has been made behind their backs. In some cases, they are not even aware that a claim has been made. This is not an attack on legitimate compensation claims. There will always be accidents and those claims need to dealt with fairly and appropriately. </p>
          <p eId="para_733"> There is no transparency around how premiums are set by the insurance industry, how claims are settled and the settlement amounts themselves. We urgently need to fill the data gap. We need the national claims information database and a price index relating to employer liability and public liability insurance. We need to get tough with insurance fraud. We cannot even get the data about the number of cases that have been taken against people who have made fraudulent claims. That needs to be fixed immediately and we need tough penalties. People need to be referred to the gardaí and taken to court where they have made fraudulent claims. Where is the specialist unit for dealing with insurance fraud that was promised for An Garda Síochána? That needs to be dealt with. There are members of the legal profession who have questions to answer and who are doing a disservice to their profession by taking claims they know have no substance whatsoever. Award levels urgently need to be benchmarked internationally. We need consistency in the level of awards. One of the reasons insurance companies settle claims is because they have a fear of what will happen if they go to court and the level of award that will be made. We need to move to a system of care, not cash in many cases. That would be the game changer in our view.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> We support the work of the Personal Injuries Commission. We believe that there is a need to review the statute of limitations. At present, a person has two years to lodge a claim from his or her date of knowledge of an injury. However, in general, a business is only allowed to keep its CCTV records for one month so when a claim is made, a business might have had the evidence that it was a bogus claim but it now cannot contest it because one law is contradicting another law, which is a key issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> Increasingly, people in business, and I know some of them, take the risk of having no insurance policy at all because of the cost of renewing their premium. It is a huge personal risk for them to take and it is not a road we want to see anyone going down.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Government will have the full support of the Fianna Fáil Party if it genuinely seeks to tackle this issue. We have put pressure on the Government for the past couple of years regarding motor insurance, business insurance and insurance in the wider community sector. In parts of the hospitality sector there is no insurance competition, with Lloyds of the UK the only provider. That is a huge risk for those businesses. If that insurance firm decides to leave the Irish insurance market, where does that leave all those businesses and their employees?</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> We need urgency. I could cite several examples where there has been slippage in the recommendations. Many of the recommendations are soft enough anyway. They are about consultations and more reports, but people want action. Change is difficult, but we urge the Minister of State to call out those who are not playing their part and name them. We would support him in doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> I acknowledge the work of the Alliance for Insurance Reform which has played a very positive role in the issue so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> Businesses will close and jobs will be lost. The lack of reform in the insurance sector is damaging the Irish economy. The Minister of State should use the mandate from this House to drive through the required reforms to bring some sense in the insurance market and protect Irish jobs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_740">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the debate. I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for his work on the matter. I welcome the people in the Public Gallery who have taken time out of their business to make a statement that they are crying out for insurance reform. The men and women in the Gallery can outline their own personal experiences with the cost of insurance in the hospitality business and in every aspect of business. They are looking for a roadmap to try to reduce the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Many businesses are considering the possibility of trading without insurance and we all know what that leads to. We all know the dangers of that regarding personal guarantees on their own homes and everything else. They are looking at claims that have been settled. There is an old saying that he who pays the piper calls the tune. However, the policyholders only find out about the settlement of the claim when they go to renew their insurance. That is unacceptable. They may have questions over whether the claim was accurate or whether it was fraudulent.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> In some cases insurance premiums have escalated by hundreds of percent. The powers that be are talking about reports in 2019, but that will be far too late for many businesses. These people will be looking for help to sustain their businesses. I could spend the next two hours of this debate talking about how people have been treated, and the legal and other costs to their businesses. Of course, many businesses are fronting up the first €10,000 of a claim and in some instances I have been informed of it being €30,000. All that has to be factored into their businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> We have to face down a number of issues, including the book of quantum for claims. There is disparity in how certain injuries are dealt with in different jurisdictions. We need consistency in that regard. Every policyholder needs to be informed of how that figure is calculated. They are sending out insurance policies and many brokers are working extremely hard to get underwriters to give the best deal. Many of the underwriters are leaving the Irish market and leaving thousands of people with escalating insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> We are asking for a roadmap. There is huge support in the House to move it forward. We want a roadmap to try to reduce the costs with immediate effect, not in one, two or three years' time. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the matter. It is a desperately serious issue and we need action on it now.</p>

          <p eId="para_745">The Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, of which I am a member, is compiling a report on the cost of doing business in Ireland. All the witnesses who have appeared before the committee have flagged the cost of insurance as their number one item. That does not come as a surprise to any of us. However, the problem is that it is not getting any better. All the work that is going on and the work that is not going on are impacting on businesses every day of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> I know the Minister of State recently met representatives of the Alliance for Insurance Reform. I met them recently in Limerick along with some of my colleagues. Some of what they told us was truly staggering. For example, there is renewal brinkmanship in the road haulage industry with insurance providers waiting until midnight on the renewal day and then bumping up the premium by a couple of hundred percent without giving any notice. This happened to a haulage company with 30 or 40 trucks on the road. How can they continue to do business in a competitive environment when they are being treated like that by their insurance companies?</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> We need meaningful reform and engagement. We need care rather than cash. In particular we need new providers in the marketplace. The Government has a job of work to do to encourage new insurance underwriters into the Irish market because at the moment it is being dominated by a small number of people who are operating almost like a cartel in certain sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> The Alliance for Insurance Reform has advised the Minister of State of all the problems, and I am sure he knows many of them. That alliance represents various hoteliers, publicans, community and voluntary groups. The Minister of State knows the list. We need action as soon as possible or else vast sections of business will be negatively impacted, particularly businesses in rural areas which are struggling with so many other factors also impacting them. We need urgency from the Government in dealing with the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">As the Minister of State knows, the small and medium-sized enterprise sector is very important throughout Ireland. I am specifically concerned about the impact of Brexit on the Border counties. As my colleagues have outlined, the premiums for employer liability and public liability insurance are proving unsustainable for many small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> The National Competitiveness Council has stated that the cost of doing business is a major concern for our overall competitiveness. Many of the SMEs have experienced business insurance increases of between 6% and 15% and in some cases much more. In addition, insurance companies are using excesses and exclusions to protect themselves at the expense of the customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> For businesses, commercial rates and insurance premiums are two of the huge burdens potentially affecting their viability and sustainability. We are at a very crucial point with Brexit looming large in everybody's mind. As we know, our small and medium-sized business sector is the prime source of revenue in the country and we cannot ignore it. We cannot continue like this and I encourage the Minister of State to take on board this important motion. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, on tabling it. The numbers in the Gallery indicate the interest in the matter. It must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_752">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion. Our small and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of the economy, whether it be in the retail sector, small contractors, the tourism industry or community groups. Instead of feeling supported, our small and medium-sized businesses feel they are being neglected by the Government, including on the issue of commercial rates, an issue we have raised here for a long time with no action.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> In this debate we are talking about the exorbitant insurance premiums and the lack of Government regulation. Recently I attended the annual conference of the Irish Hotels Federation. That industry is very labour intensive and provides great jobs throughout the country. Delegates said that one of the biggest challenges facing their industry after Brexit is the issue of high insurance premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Some of the stories that they shared with me about rate increases over the last months have been breathtaking. Some small businesses in particular are questioning how they will be able to survive in the future. While the Government has published recommendations from the cost of insurance working group relating to employee and public liability insurance, people want to see action with legislation for a cap on the level of personal injury awards. That is critically important. There needs to be a cap and the insurance industry needs to start to challenge some of the claims that have been submitted instead of settling out of court. There also needs to be tackling of the fraud and exaggerated insurance claims. Strong deterrents need to be brought in to ensure that people refrain from this. Anyone who is caught submitting a fraudulent or exaggerated claim should face serious consequences. I urge rapid action on this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, for tabling this motion. We all know what is happening. There are two companies in my part of the constituency, in south Sligo, including a haulage company which employs 45 people and has an insurance cost this year of €135,000. There are 45 jobs at risk there and there is no question about it. In the hospitality industry, there is a small hotel which had insurance of €30,000. It has gone up to €65,000 this year. There is no question that unless this is dealt with very quickly, jobs will be lost and businesses will go out of business. With regard to motor insurance, I have a renewal certificate here. This company, AXA, is one of the most reputable companies in the country. Condition No. 3 on this certificate addresses limitations as to use, stating that it includes use for social, domestic and pleasure purposes, excluding cover for commuting to work. In the name of God, where are we going? This is in the small print of this insurance policy and this person needs a car to get to work. This is going on, and if people have an accident, they do not record it to ensure they retain their no-claims bonuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> We heard insurance companies say that we have the penalty points system in place and that it will bring down the cost of insurance. It has not brought down the cost of insurance because people over 30 years of age with no penalty points are still paying much more than they were paying last year and the year before.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which was brought in maybe six or seven years ago, worked for a while and can work again but I understand that it has been bypassed by the legal profession. That needs to be looked at. These insurance companies should be brought into an Oireachtas committee and the questions should be put to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">People in my community and communities throughout the country are at crisis point in trying to run their businesses because of the crippling cost of employer liability and public liability insurance. Whether self-employed people, tradespeople, companies or, indeed, as referenced by many others, voluntary and community enterprises, the cost of this type of insurance is proving to be unsustainable and will push many people out of business. We need to remember that there are in excess of 970,000 people employed in this sector across the country. The retail sector is the low-hanging fruit for insurance fraud and is the sector most susceptible to bogus claims. As a consequence of that, many struggle to pay the premiums and, as alluded to, they are contemplating self-insuring which is a major risk or a risk too far. There are no active deterrents for unscrupulous people who contemplate exaggerating their claims. Where people do this and it is found by the court, they should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions as a matter of fact. Others have referred to the book of quantum. My time is limited so I will not refer to that but just flag it again as others have. I would argue that there should be more involvement with policyholders in the settlement of claims and, as a priority, they should at least be informed of how much people are awarded so that there is more transparency. There is a need to deal with them head on in letting them know what is happening with claims. Somebody said that there is a possible cartel. It is my firm belief that a cartel is operating with no regulation in the industry and no competition in pricing. If we do not get to grips in this country with those spiralling and unsustainable insurance costs, the small enterprises and the business sectors referenced, for example, by Retail Excellence Ireland, Retail Grocery Dairy &amp; Allied Trades Association, RGDATA, IBEC and the Small Firms Association, will soon be priced out of business.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Jim Daly)<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_759">I welcome the opportunity to address Dáil Éireann on the motion moved by Fianna Fáil on business insurance. The motion sets out many of the issues that have been raised and recognised by the cost of insurance working group, including the lack of availability of affordable business insurance. The Minister for Finance therefore does not disagree with much of what is contained in the motion and would like to set out what the Government is doing to address many of the issues raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> On the context for the employer and public liability report, the difficulties being faced by many businesses in being able to obtain cover at a reasonable price was the main reason the Government agreed that in the second phase of its work, the cost of insurance working group, chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, would examine the factors contributing to increased costs of insurance to business, in particular employer and public liability insurance. The extensive consultation process that the working group engaged in with the business sector gave greater insight into these difficulties, particularly as to how they are impacting on competitiveness and sustainability. As a result, the working group's report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out. The recommendations and actions are detailed in an action plan contained in the report with agreed timelines for implementation. The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to increase transparency through enhancing levels of transparency and improving data sharing and collection processes, a review of the level of damages in personal injury cases through a Law Reform Commission examination, and improving the personal injuries litigation framework through a number of specified measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> A key aim overall of both the report on the cost of motor insurance and the report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance is to try to ensure consistency of award levels through the regular use of the book of quantum. In essence, this should mean that no matter what way a claim is settled, whether directly by the insurer, through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, known as PIAB, or as a result of a court decision, the outcome should be broadly the same. If consistency of awards can be applied in a broad sense, especially for soft tissue injuries, it should have two very significant effects. The first is that there should be less reason for cases to go to litigation as the level of awards granted by the courts will be aligned with those provided by PIAB. This in turn should mean a reduction in legal costs. Secondly, a stable claims and awards environment should mean that the reserves put aside by insurers to meet future claims would not have to be regularly adjusted to reflect new developments such as increases in award levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> A common criticism received from business stakeholders was that award levels in the book of quantum were too high, particularly in respect of certain soft tissue injuries, compared with those in other jurisdictions and should be cut across the board. However, such a view ignores the fact that the book is a guide which merely reflects the prevailing levels of compensation in Ireland for various types of injury based upon what has actually been paid out in the courts, by the State Claims Agency, in direct settlements by the insurance sector, or awarded by PIAB. Currently, therefore, the only way that the award levels in the book can be lowered is if there is a decrease in the actual level of awards paid out. The report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance recognises the seriousness of this issue through its recommendation that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries. While it is acknowledged that this will take some time, the parallel benchmarking exercise of personal injury awards in Ireland, with awards elsewhere being currently carried out by the Personal Injuries Commission, should add extra impetus to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> There was also a general perception by stakeholders that the book was not being consistently adhered to by the Judiciary, leading to higher payouts. However, a revised version of the book was produced in October 2016 and this has alleviated the key complaint of the Judiciary itself, that the book had become irrelevant having not been updated for 12 years prior to that. The 2016 edition also includes additional injury categories and improved granularity of injuries. Moreover, the passing of legislation, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (amendment) Bill, another recommendation of the report on the cost of motor insurance, which it is hoped will be later this year, will ensure that the book is reviewed every three years from now on.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">There was a major focus in the second phase by business stakeholders on the claims settlement process. It was indicated to the working group that on occasion businesses only became aware at the time of renewal that a claim had been submitted against their policy and sometimes settled. There is a provision in law to ensure a defendant is informed as early as possible about a claim through the receipt of an initial warning letter. The letter is required to be sent under section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which provides that where a plaintiff fails to serve a notice on the defendant within two months of the date of an accident, the date of knowledge or as soon as practicable thereafter, he or she may be penalised in costs and, furthermore, the court may draw such inferences from the failure as appear appropriate. However, the working group believes the notification requirements are not being complied with in practice and that no subsequent penalty is being enforced, either in respect of costs or inferences being drawn. There is, therefore, a recommendation to strengthen the wording of section 8 in order to shorten the period of notification and make the penalty provisions more robust.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> The relevant law in tackling fraud in a personal injuries context is the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004. The working group focused on sections 14 and 25, which create criminal offences when false or misleading affidavits and evidence, dealt with in sections 14 and 25, respectively, are knowingly provided in a personal injuries case. It is proposed to amend section 14 such that a court will be permitted to draw inferences if the required verifying affidavit is not lodged within the allowed timeframe. </p>
          <p eId="para_766"> Attention was also given to section 26, which requires the court to dismiss a personal injuries claim when a plaintiff knowingly provides false or misleading evidence. The working group concluded that section 26 had been invoked on fewer occasions than would have been expected since the Act was commenced in 2004. It believes the provisions of the Act are largely fit for purpose and that the penalties are more than adequate, with fines of up to €100,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to ten years, but are not used to the extent to which they could be. Consequently, the recommendations made in this area relate mainly to encouraging the greater use of the existing provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> As regards the reportage, investigation and prosecution of alleged insurance fraud, the major recommendation is that a new set of guidelines be drawn up between Insurance Ireland, An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions. In particular, it should be ensured any case dismissed in court on the grounds of false or misleading evidence, whether under section 26 or otherwise, should at least be automatically considered for investigation by An Garda Síochána under section 25, notwithstanding the different thresholds to be reached in civil and criminal cases. The new set of guidelines will be drawn up in order to standardise and improve the development of cases for submission to An Garda Síochána. A previous protocol agreed to in 2004 between the Insurance Federation of Ireland and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation on the reporting of suspected fraudulent claims represents a good starting point for the formulation of the new set of guidelines. </p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Overall, the working group strongly believes there is an onus on all insurance providers to become more proactive in tackling fraud, for example, by fighting dubious claims, investing more resources in detection, building up strong evidence bases and following up cases with An Garda Síochána at regular intervals. </p>
          <p eId="para_769"> The Government understands the motivation behind the motion and agrees with elements of it. We are not, therefore, bringing forward a counter-motion, but I point out that many of the steps called for in the motion are already being implemented pursuant to the reports on the cost of motor and employers' and public liability insurance. However, the Government has concerns about several points in the motion such as those related to the book of quantum and the declined cases mechanism for employers' and public liability insurance. In addition, the Government does not believe it is possible to bring forward the deadlines for the CSO price index or the national claims information database for business insurance. Owing to these concerns, the Government will abstain in the vote on the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_778"> Sinn Féin is happy to support the Fianna Fáil motion with the inclusion of our amendment which aims to free one of the many Bills brought forward by the Opposition that the Government is intent on burying. The Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017 was drafted by our finance spokesperson, Deputy Pearse Doherty, and is aimed at addressing one of the many issues which contribute to the escalating cost of insurance for businesses. I hope Fianna Fáil and other parties will support the amendment, to which I will return.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Businesses are being bled dry by outrageous increases in insurance premiums which are forcing some low margin enterprises out of business. All Members will have been told by small SMEs and businesspeople that they cannot afford their insurance premiums because of the yearly increases. The CSO recorded an increase of 57% in insurance premiums between 2011 and 2016. The increase cannot be blamed solely on high pay-outs to meet injury costs. It requires reform of the way in which insurance companies operate. High pay-outs and fraud are not solely to blame, although they are contributory factors. Neither pay-outs for injuries nor insurance fraud is new, but the massive increases are. Therefore, I do not understand how the insurance companies expect us to believe everyone is to blame but them.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Insurance companies play a major role in the economy because they provide products such as motor, home and public liability insurance which many people are required to have. Because of their prominent and important position in the economy, insurance companies are not comparable to other undertakings and should be required to be far more transparent about their premiums and profits. Sinn Féin believes a much tougher stance can be taken by the Government with insurance companies. I have met the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and raised this issue as a real concern. Its investigation of insurance companies is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> A number of businesses surveyed by Chambers Ireland for the latest report of the cost of insurance working group stated they had suffered increases of over 100% in their premiums, which is totally unacceptable. Some are being forced to opt for high excess levels in an effort to lower their premiums, something which can be very risky for a business if a claim is made. As other Deputies stated, some companies are not taking out insurance at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> With Deputies Niall Collins and Tom Neville, I recently attended a meeting in Limerick of the Alliance for Insurance Reform. The non-political group brings together 20 civic and business organisations across Ireland which represent 35,000 members, over 633,000 employees and 41,300 volunteers, or a huge cross-section of people and businesses across the country who have been directly affected by increased insurance costs and forced to organise to try to fight back against the constant and unfair hikes in insurance costs. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael D’Arcy, met the alliance this week. After the meeting it expressed its intense disappointment at the slow pace of reform and stated policy holders had been thrown to the wolves by the Government. That is a damming indictment by a non-political organisation of the Government’s response to the massive problem of escalating insurance costs. It seems that the Government has been lobbied and taken in by vested interests and big business. That does not come as a surprise as Fine Gael is the party of big business, the wealthy and billionaires, including American billionaires whom it can help out when called on to so do, as the Taoiseach proved last week. I have no confidence that the Government will address the issue of escalating insurance costs, as it sees no benefit for it in so doing. The Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, of which I am a member, has for many years been examining issues related to the cost of doing business in Ireland. With Deputies Niall Collins and Tom Neville, I have invited representatives of the Alliance for Insurance Reform to come before the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Insurance costs have repeatedly been cited by almost all commercial representative groups as a threat to the viability of businesses across Ireland. The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, has described how insurance costs are not merely high but, rather, a threat to enterprises in sectors such as the hospitality, distribution and retail sectors. It has stated the solutions to the insurance cost problem are remarkably simple but politically challenging as they require the facing down of vested interests that view insurance reform as hostile to their livelihoods. The Small Firms Association, SFA, has stated small businesses are facing an insurance costs crisis, with 81% of SFA members having experienced a rise in premiums since last year. IBEC has stated the recent upward trend in annual premiums is proving to be unsustainable for low margin businesses, particularly those impacted on by Brexit. According to a survey conducted by the Irish Hotels Federation, over 80% of hoteliers have stated rising insurance costs are having a significant negative impact on their business.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Businesses will face huge challenges from Brexit in the coming years and simply cannot afford to have the additional problems and costs of insurance increases. We need real action now. A number of community groups have been affected. I have been contacted by groups that organise festivals that cannot do all the things they would have normally done due to their increased costs. One local community group in Limerick that had an insurance cost of €12,000 last year was given a quote of €50,000 this year. It was able to shop around and it got a premium of €40,000, which it struggled to pay. The money was paid out of its reserves so the group does not know how it will fund its insurance premium next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> The Government's approach has been described as "death by a thousand consultations" and that is an accurate portrayal. Every time we raise this issue, we are referred to some new report, consultation, discussion or working group. We do not need any more of that; we need real and tangible action. The Minister will probably reply with the usual, unhelpful Government mantra - that the Government cannot do anything about insurance costs as such products are commercial in nature. That approach is of no use to anyone. Insurance policies are not the same as other commercial products. One cannot drive a motor vehicle legally in Ireland without buying an insurance policy. Private drivers and businesses with commercial vehicles are forced to pay whatever price an insurance company wants to charge with no avenue to challenge them. Due to the legal requirement imposed by the State in this particular area, the Government should - and indeed does - have a role and responsibility in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> I wish to speak briefly about the amendment we are tabling to the motion. Sinn Féin is proposing a very straightforward amendment to demand that a money message be provided to Deputy Pearse Doherty's Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill. The Bill would empower businesses against insurance companies by updating consumer contract law which is archaic. The Bill to which I refer is a part of what we need to be moving towards, namely, a new culture where the consumer is actually protected from the banks and other financial institutions. The Bill specifically deals with insurance contracts and implements a wide range of measures to rebalance the law in favour of the consumer. Laws designed for 18th century sailing merchants are overhauled and replaced with modern consumer-friendly laws. The archaic laws in force have resulted in a power imbalance where insurers hold all the cards. For example, an insurer could, under current law, refuse to pay out if a house burnt down because of an unrelated issue such as a burglar alarm not working. It also puts the onus on the insurer to ask for all the relevant information instead of leaving it to the customer to guess what information might be relevant. If the Sinn Féin Bill is passed, insurers would no longer be allowed to refuse payment due to technical issues or because a consumer did not know he or she was expected to volunteer information that was not sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> This Bill is desperately needed to give the consumers a fighting chance. Insurers will also have to put their application forms and conditions in plain, intelligible language and, in any dispute, the consumer would be given the benefit of the doubt. As we know, the Government is using its power over money messages to frustrate the legislation coming from Opposition parties. The Bill was not opposed by the Government and it will be of great practical use to consumers and should not be delayed any longer. In conclusion, Sinn Féin is happy to support Fianna Fáil's motion, with the inclusion of a small amendment. We hope that Fianna Fáil can use its coalition deal with Fine Gael to force though real reforms in this area to help businesses.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinKenny" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_788">I welcome Fianna Fáil's motion. Insurance is something that affects everyone in the State, especially people with small businesses. I read through the Minister's speech and while it is strong on rhetoric on what the Government is trying to do, it does not go to the core of the problem and address the issues. The problems we have in the insurance sector are a symptom of the broken economic model for domestic business in this country. There is not a focus on recognising that the domestic sector needs help. That goes to the core of everything we talk about in all our financial services and our banking policy is very similar.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> The banks in this country failed and everything was done to maintain them and to bring them back on-board to make sure that the pillar banks became strong again. That was done at the expense of the ordinary people and many business people who lost their business and who were stressed out in recent years trying to pay exorbitant interest rates. We have the highest interest rates in Europe for business and domestic banking yet the banks get the money from the same place as every other bank in Europe, often at less than 0.5%, namely, the European Central Bank. That is an example of the problem and we have the very same issue when it comes to insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> Reference is made to insurance fraud in the motion and previous speakers referred to it also. I accept it is an issue, but it has always been a factor. However, the reason we have had the exorbitant increases in insurance premia in recent years is because of the economic crash. During the boom times the insurance companies invested all their reserves in various bonds around the world but those bonds failed. When that happened the insurance companies lost their money and now look who is paying the price - it is the ordinary business people we see in the Gallery and around the country, and the ordinary car insurers, namely, the young people aged 18 or 19 who are trying to get insured and are being given quotes of up to €5,000 and €6,000 in order to be able to go to work. The problem we have is that ultimately everything is done to protect the big corporate interests at the expense of the small players. That needs to be reversed. That is the action the Government must take to address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> Many business people take a big risk. They put themselves on the line in order to try to do something because they have a vision of creating something better for themselves and creating a better future for the community in which they live. All of us, regardless of where live in this country, have an obligation to try to make the place around us better. The business community, in particular those involved in small and medium enterprises are at the coalface of doing that and great credit is due to them for the work they do. However, they are not supported. The broken economic model to which I referred earlier is at the very core of that. No emphasis is being put on sustaining the small business community in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> There are five cattle marts at the moment in County Leitrim. The mart managers tell me that in many cases the insurance they pay has almost trebled in recent years. That is no accident. It is not because anyone had an accident in the mart. It is not because anything happened. It is because the insurance companies are trying to get back the money they lost on the bonds, gambling on international markets in the past ten years. The Government must recognise that reality and examine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> Banks, insurance companies and the big players are using their power to grind down ordinary people. The only chance people have is for the Government to stand up for them. The job of the Government is to step in to be the arbitrator of last resort. The Government needs to fulfil that role but, unfortunately, it is not doing it. This evening's motion is very welcome because it calls on the Government to intervene. We cannot hide behind excuses such as fraud or anything else. Such reasons will always be there. The corporate sector will always find a reason to increase prices and increase profits. What is happening is profiteering on the back of ordinary small businesses around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> My colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, referred to the Bill introduced by Deputy Pearse Doherty, the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill, which the Government accepted and which would help in this and in many other instances but is waiting for a money message from the Cabinet. When Bills are approved by this House they go to the Cabinet and if there is a cost on the Exchequer only the Cabinet can approve them. That measure is being used all the time to hold up good Bills that could move things forward. If the Bill were enacted it would ensure that insurance companies would not be able to hide in the way they currently can. It would ensure that they would have to be at least a little bit more honest than they are at present, which would be a considerable advance on the current position. We all know people who have had various insurance claims in their businesses relating to fires or other issues but the insurance companies use every possible excuse not to pay. However, it does not work the other way as people do not have an excuse not to pay them. That is the difference. We need to ensure the Government steps up to the mark and becomes the arbitrator of last resort and does something for the ordinary business people and the people of the country.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_795">I welcome and support the motion. It is now clear that it will be assented to by the majority of Members. The question to be asked is what action will be taken as a result of its passing because, increasingly, we are seeing motions being passed by the House but little or no action thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> The motion is very practical. It speaks to the concerns of business owners the length and breadth of the country. There is one line in it that I want to highlight. It reads: "Calls on the Government to ... legally oblige insurers to provide a breakdown of the premium cost to the business and to provide more information to the business on how premiums are calculated". We do not have transparency in the process on the cost of premiums for individual businesses and small business owners throughout the country. Until such time as we have transparency, all of the rhetoric and the work done for the cost of insurance working group's report will be for naught. We will not have transparency until the Minister tackles that dynamic and is able to see which inherent costs within premiums are to make provision for bad debts and claims against an insurance company and for super-normal profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> I agree with previous speakers. The insurance industry is acting like a cartel. Insurance companies are not being transparent on the profits they are earning and if they are not being transparent on the profits they are earning, they can charge ordinary people whatever premiums they wish. If there is one entity in the country that seems to be the voice of all of the big guns, the international players which begin with the letter A, for instance, it is Insurance Ireland. In interaction with the finance committee on issues such as the book of quantum, the level and consistency of awards and the high cost of premiums the views of the insurance companies seems to have been articulated through one vehicle - Insurance Ireland. Because we do not see the names and faces, the insurance sector is able to hide behind Insurance Ireland and we still do not have transparency. That is partly the reason insurance premiums are so high. It is because the insurance companies are earning super-normal profits which are in-built in the cost of each and every premium paid throughout the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> I want to refer specifically to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy's contribution. In speaking about the level and consistency of awards and the book of quantum he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_799">The first is that there should be less reason for cases to go to litigation as the level of awards granted by the courts will be aligned with those provided by PIAB. This in turn should mean a reduction in legal costs. Secondly, a stable claims and awards environment should mean that the reserves put aside by insurers to meet future claims would not have to be regularly adjusted to reflect new developments such as increases in award levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">We do not know in real terms what reserves insurance companies put aside and until such time as there is that transparency, it is impossible to predict the level and consistency of awards. In other words, it is impossible to predict with certainty that it will result in a decrease in the cost of premiums for individuals and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> There is still a long way to go and, to be fair to the Minister of State who was formerly a member of the finance committee, I do not doubt his bona fides in seeking to take action on the issue, but what we need is a sense of urgency on the part of the Government in an intervention by the State because it seems that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has only been tinkering at the edges. It does not appear to have weighed in or been imbued with the resources it needs to fully interrogate insurance companies to see whether they are acting as a cartel. What the Minister of State probably needs to tackle this issue is the resources to attract people from the private sector to organisations such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and pay them commensurate salaries. I refer to forensic accountants and so on who would be able to go in and examine the insurance companies to see what they are doing on the inside. Until such that happens, I fear that we will be back here again in 12 months' time paying lip service to the people in the Visitors Gallery who have been listening to politicians like me talk for a long time about the cost of doing business and who want to see some action being taken at the end of the day. We have the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 which is Government policy but nowhere in it does it speak about the increasing cost of doing business in the domestic sector. We will bend over backwards to help an IDA Ireland backed company coming to Ireland. I say that as a former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation. We will do everything for an Enterprise Ireland backed company, but what we now need to do is start to look after the companies, the challenges of which are represented by the motion and which want to see real action being taken now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_802">The motion is timely following the report in January of the cost of insurance working group on the cost of employers' and public liability nsurance. The report is the second piece of work from the working group, the first being the work it carried out on the issue of motor insurance. While there have been some small and welcome reductions in the cost of motor premiums, the motor insurance sector remains problematic and continues to impact on the cost of doing business and costs for ordinary citizens and households. The motion is comprehensive. I agree that there is an urgent need to implement the 15 action points referenced in the report of the cost of insurance working group. Of particular importance are the requests for legislation and Government action to legally require insurers to provide a breakdown of premium costs for a business and explain the basis on which premiums are calculated; that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board's book of quantum be updated regularly - I believe it is proposed that it be done every three years - and that it be based on medical evidence and costs, not solely historic claims; and that the deadline for the Central Bank of Ireland’s feasibility study be brought forward to provide for the inclusion of employers' liability and public liability insurance data in the national claims information database. The motion also rightly asks the Government to move towards the creation of a single European insurance market to increase competitiveness. In some of the discussion we looked at the impact of Brexit and so on on the entire market. The Central Bank has a particular role in that regard because one of the unique aspects of the insurance business is that quite a few of the big players, the names of which, as my colleague, Deputy Sean Sherlock, said start with the letter "A", are not regulated by the Central Bank. I believe the regulator is the Bank of England. That is another bizarre aspect in trying to regulate the insurance industry in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> Soaring insurance and legal costs are putting a strain on businesses across the country and the position is particularly tough for small and medium enterprises, SMEs. The Chambers Ireland cost of insurance survey in August-September 2017 reported that 43% of respondents had seen an increase of between 5% and 20% in their premiums. Worryingly, a small percentage had reported increases of between 50% and 100%. In some cases there was more than a 100% increase. The justification given in 64% of cases by the brokers for the increases included "market conditions", whatever they are, and in 10% of cases "overall increases in claims", which one would imagine is much more important. Businesses, first and foremost, have legal responsibilities to their workforces, customers and the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> National Competitiveness Council Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge 2017 report, published last December, also highlighted increased insurance costs as having a serious impact on our competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">It also mentioned the lack of transparent data available in this sector and the problems with international comparisons owing to the nature of insurance and its role in business, including the fact that "the final price charged is generally not publicised." This comment understates the position in the insurance market. The National Competitiveness Council's report made some of the same recommendations that are included in this valuable motion. I welcome the action plan in the report which outlines the deadlines, relevant bodies responsible and lead or owner of each action. This is the approach that must be adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> Anyone who had been involved in the running of a small business, including many Deputies, or has served or serves as a company director will know the impact of employer and public liability insurance costs on a company's annual expenditure, especially over the past decade. While directors at meetings often urge managers and chief executive officers to shop around, the Irish market is characterised by limited competition despite the operation here of a number of large multinational insurers.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> A feature of the business insurance market and other insurance markets in Ireland is the dearth of data available from the insurance industry and Courts Service, to which the motion correctly alludes. Astonishingly, there are also few data available from the Central Statistics Office and Personal Injuries Assessment Board. This public data vacuum damages the ability of the Oireachtas to legislate and conduct its business. The relevant organisations must produce the data we need to be able to track the insurance industry. There is good evidence that in the five and a half year period from January 2011 until July 2016 insurance costs in general increased by 57%. During the same period, approximately 42% of non-motor related PIAB applications were related to employer liability insurance and public liability insurance, with the figures for each being 15% and 27%, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> Insurance Ireland's fact file 2016, the most recent fact file available, reports that Insurance Ireland's 18 domestic non-life members wrote gross premium of €3.253 billion in 2016, which was 13.7% higher than in 2015, whereas gross incurred claims were €2.09 billion or 0.5% lower than in 2015. The fact file shows a relentless rise in Insurance Ireland's members' gross non-life premium income between 2012 when it stood at €2.43 billion and 2016 when it stood at €3.25 billion. The significant portion of GDP represented by the insurance business, which has a workforce of more than 15,000 people, shows the significant impact insurance has on all aspects of the economy and society. I understand the sector accounts for approximately 6.5% of total GDP. It is striking that the most recent fact file from Insurance Ireland shows that in terms of insurance density and the premiums <i>per capita </i>in 2016, Ireland is ranked alongside countries such as Switzerland, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg. Measured in US dollars, the total insurance cost <i>per capita</i> in Ireland stood at $4,408 in 2016, which was higher than the figure for the United Kingdom, Norway and Australia and much higher than the equivalent figures in European Union partners such as France. There is clearly a problem in this area and the Minister must urgently pursue the remedies outlined in the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> We cannot discuss insurance premiums without mentioning the legal costs associated with the sector. In the Department of Finance's work on motor insurance it was found that such costs account for 42% of the compensation amount paid to claimants. For example, a €100,000 compensation payment will also incur an average further payment of €24,900 for legal and other costs and a further €17,200 for insurer legal and other costs, giving a total payment by the insurer of €142,400.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> Towards the end of 2016, reports indicated that insurance fraudsters from the United Kingdom were coming to Ireland to cheat the system and obtain much higher claim payouts than in the UK. In one case, the book of quantum payment in Ireland for a broken femur was 318% higher than the equivalent figure in the UK. The book of quantum shows vast differences in awards in Ireland compared with the United Kingdom, the market with which we are most heavily involved, notwithstanding Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> As previous speakers noted, one of the key aspects of the report is the lack of transparency across the insurance sector. The importance of improving transparency in the sector is mentioned a number of times in the working group's report. This relates in particular to the Courts Service where the dearth of information is very concerning. Most citizens will ask why there is no easily available register of awards by the courts. As has been observed in traffic law and other important areas of law, it is astonishing and unacceptable in the digital age that we do not have transparent and reliable data to help Ministers to plan policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> The insurance industry must take some responsibility for the terrible strain it is placing on small and medium enterprises. Last July saw dawn raids by the European Commission on Insurance Ireland, brokers and insurers. The European Union's Directorate-General for Competition has investigations ongoing into whether there has been a cartel operating in our motor industry. It is important that these European initiatives continue and the other important actions called for in the motion are supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> I support the motion and urge the Government to speedily implement the 15 recommendations in the working group's report in order that we may begin to see some reduction in the horrendous business insurance costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_815">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the motion. I have raised the issue of insurance many times in this Chamber. Small and medium local businesses and community and voluntary groups in my constituency of Cork South-West are crippled by constantly increasing insurance premiums, whether for property, vehicle or public liability insurance. Small business owners, self-employed persons and entrepreneurs keep the country on its feet, employing 970,000 people or 44% of the total workforce. Rural towns depend on local businesses, small pubs, post offices and Garda stations, yet these continue to decline in number because of consistent increases in rates and insurance costs. I know of garage owners, publicans, car owners and farmers who cannot pay their insurance premiums. Many are taking a chance and operating without insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> Only a couple of weeks ago, representatives of the hotel industry informed a committee meeting that insurance premiums for their members had increased by tens of thousands of euro through no fault of their own. Nightclub owners are being put out of business and rural towns are dying as a result of the unsustainable cost of doing business. </p>
          <p eId="para_817"> I support the motion and hope the cost of insurance working group's report will be implemented without delay. Businesses are closing daily and it is high time the Government did something to address the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> Insurance companies should be legally obliged to notify their customers of an expected increase in premiums prior to the renewal date. This would give them ample time to shop around or reallocate finances to cover the costs of the increase, rather than forcing them to close at the last minute or continue without insurance, as occurs in some cases. Time and again, Opposition motions, including a recent motion from the Rural Independent Group, have been introduced pleading with the Government to introduce some form of regulation for the insurance industry. The Minister of State set out a number of reasons for the high cost of insurance, including outcomes of court cases. The bottom line is that insurance bills are not reducing. We can talk about the issue until the cows come home but there is no benefit in proposing motions if we do not take action to resolve the problem. Is the Government listening and working to ensure the insurance industry sits up and listens to people who are suffering on the ground?</p>

          <p eId="para_820">I thank Deputies Michael McGrath and Moynihan and other Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party for tabling the motion. I warmly welcome the representatives of 200 businesses who are present in the Public Gallery. It is important to recognise them, many of whom I know. Looking up at the Gallery, I realise that all those present are extremely busy people who improve the lot of their communities by creating wealth and employment. They do not need to be here.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> I am grateful that the Fine Gael Party has woken up and agreed not to oppose the motion. While it at least has the common sense not to oppose the motion, someone should apologise for the sorrowful sight of the empty Government benches. This sets a bad example and provides an indication of the seriousness with which the Government treats the issue of business insurance costs. Fair dues to the Fianna Fáil Party for introducing the motion. I compliment it on doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> Over the years, I have pointed out that insurance costs are out of control and premiums are putting respectable business people out of business and, worse still, preventing them from expanding their businesses, driving on and creating more employment. </p>
          <p eId="para_823">That is what we want, so the Government is letting itself down tonight because its Members would not sit in on the debate and hear what has been said.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> I thank people like Mr. Declan Ryan in my own community. I thank Mr. Willie McClure from the <i>South Kerry Advertiser</i>, who has highlighted this matter over a long period and has done some excellent reports on it. I thank all the people for coming here today from around the country. I thank our neighbours from the Cork side but most important are the people coming from County Kerry. I thank them all very much.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> The passing of this motion means a certain amount but I was involved with the Rural Independent Group when we passed a very important motion concerned with the protection of our post offices. It was passed and every Member in the House, including those from Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and the Government, supported it. Has that really protected our post office network? No, it has not. I welcome the fact that the motion will pass and it is the most that Fianna Fáil could do tonight. I ask that there be action afterwards and this will not just amount to lip service. I hope this will mean the premiums that business people are paying will be reduced and people will be able to continue expanding their businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> Am I sharing time?</p>

          <p eId="para_828">No, I think I will be able to use it all right. I have seen first-hand the blackguarding that has gone on between the medical and legal professions, as well as the nonsense we can see when we compare awards in England and Ireland. What is happening out there is crazy. There seems to be people who have homing devices for finding misfortune. There are people living in places where they have had the misfortune to find not just one hole on one occasion but maybe five or six different holes in different places. For some miraculous reason, these people cannot see a hole but they fall into it. They sue local authorities then they go to a nightclub, where they have the massive misfortune of missing a step and falling all the way down the stairs. The question is whether they really fall or not. At the same time, somebody must pay for it. What is going on is disgraceful. Just because insurance companies are paying out the money does not mean this is not fraud or robbery. It is the same as putting one's hand into somebody else's pocket and taking their money. We are paying the price at the end of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> I have no problem with genuine claims and as far as I am concerned, the people seriously hurt in road accidents or accidents at work do not get enough money at all. I am talking about bogus claims. These are the people who get a small tip to the back of a car and instead of getting out and saying they are fine and the old bumper can be fixed and is grand, they go around holding their necks for six months afterwards. When the court case is settled, all of a sudden the neck is fine and these people are out disco dancing the next week, looking to see where they will fall again and have another claim. There are serial complainants and people making a living out of this type of racket. How they live in such a way I do not know. It is wrong and horrible. It is our job as legislators to try to stand up against this. We must stand up for the business people as at the end of the day they create work and wealth in communities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_830">One would wonder when we have approximately 2,500 practising GPs in this country why we have 10,000 practising solicitors. This indicates there is much work and money to be made, to be very blunt. Collectively, this Dáil has a responsibility: we can give out but we want solutions. We need to solve this problem collectively as small and medium enterprises all over the country are in trouble. I thank the Minister of State for attending the meeting with the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, and Mr. Brendan Egan from Castlerea mart, as marts are a small or medium business. They are screwed with insurance as well because of constant claims. They need cameras everywhere. If something happens to a person at home, he or she cannot claim but nevertheless a solicitor can advertise with "no win, no fee". This craic must stop and if a person takes a case there should be repercussions if it is exaggerated or lost. Money should be repaid.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> We need to look again at the book of quantum and at England's example. We must implement the 15 recommendations as soon as possible. Let us be honest, as there are people here with their own businesses. We will not be able to drive on both sides of the road. We must ensure we can stand up to be counted. When the book of quantum is done, we must ensure it is adhered to. The Judiciary must run in line with this. We cannot have a system with fairy figures being given out. People are panicking. Insurance companies, including one for the farming community, will not even contest a case if it is under €100,000. Those companies let such claims through but this leads to rising insurance. People's hearts are in their mouths waiting for quotes for the cost of insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> Right around this Dáil we must work on this together. We can give out to a Minister or the Government but the insurance problem has been escalating in the past four or five years. It is extremely bad. Ultimately, if we lose the small and medium enterprises that employ most of the people around the country, we will have less money coming to the Exchequer and less going out. It is up to us, collectively, to solve this problem and get working on it as fast as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_834">I welcome everybody in the Gallery and thank them for being here. It is widely accepted that we have a serious problem here and businesses across the country, including many small and medium enterprises, are being crippled by insurance costs that are going up and up. We know the SME sector employs approximately 44% of all people employed in this country, so we should do all we can to protect those businesses to ensure they can operate in a sustainable fashion. We are very good at reports, talking, more reports and having no action. The question must be when will the Government complete the action points on the report on the cost of employer and public liability. The time for talking is now over. If the Government cannot solve a very obvious and simple problem, what are we doing? We know this matter has been around and highlighted many times over a period. The Government has not yet fixed it and I want to know what it will do about it, as does every person in the Gallery tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> It is very easy to blame the lawyers in this. I was a lawyer and I dealt with personal injuries. I was also the victim of what I considered a spurious whiplash claim. My insurance company did not consult with me and it paid out without challenging that claim. It is a major problem that insurance companies are not taking responsibility and paying out claims without challenging them. That must be admitted. It is very easy to blame other professions and pass the buck by saying the problem must be with somebody else. The insurance companies must do their jobs as well. They should challenge claims where they believe there is a real and substantial risk that the claim could be false.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> It is very important that we guarantee those here tonight that we will have a business environment in which they can operate and which is sustainable. Insurance forms a massive part of ongoing operating costs and it is affecting our competitiveness and the ability of SMEs to retain the jobs we have and employ new people. I can give an example before I finish. A tree surgeon in my community had a few vans on the road and he employed men. The cost of his insurance almost doubled in one year so he had to let people go. That is happening all across the country.</p>

        <speech by="#JackieCahill" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Deputy Jackie Cahill<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_837">It is accepted that the cost of insurance for businesses right around the country is crippling them and ultimately costing jobs. It is particularly difficult for the small and medium enterprise sectors because it does not have the huge amount of business to dilute the significant costs of business. The cost of business insurance is now holding small and medium enterprises back, as we hear of quotes doubling and trebling from previous years. It is stopping business owners from investing in marketing and other promotional activity that drives job creation in this sector. The lack of real competition in the market means business owners must accept this cost with no worthwhile or effective means of shopping around.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> It is extremely frustrating that the Government believes that since the report on the cost of employer liability and public liability insurance has been published, the job is done. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth, as many of the recommendations in the report are not set to be completed until 2019. It is a criticism I have of this Government that all its energy seems to be focused on big projects, accompanied by millions of euro of spin. There is a promise of delivery down the road at some utopian point. Whether it is about hospital beds, housing or broadband, we will have much in the future but meanwhile people must suffer in the short to medium term. It is the same with job creation. We will have many jobs in future and we have been promised full employment. We might even see jobs in the regions if we are willing to wait for the roll-out of projects like Project Ireland 2040.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">We need jobs now in the regions. I refer to vision of the future that this Government seems hell-bent on selling to the people. Issues such as the management and control of business insurance could have an immediate effect on the provision of jobs in the regions. It might be tedious work and it might not grab the headlines but it is work that would see quick results. It would rapidly ease the financial burden on small employers and encourage them to invest in marketing that will grow their business and provide much-needed jobs. This should be the focus of the Government. I urge the Minister to bring about the necessary changes in business insurance costs to make that happen.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankORourke" eId="spk_307">
          <from>Deputy Frank O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_840">I, too, welcome this motion and support my colleague, Deputy McGrath, in the work he is doing. I refer not only to this area but also to the proposals he has brought forward in relation to motor insurance and in many other areas that affect business people and people generally. The small and medium enterprise sector is an important one in our community and economy. I welcome all of the people here this evening in the Visitors Gallery. The sector employs nearly 1 million people. It provides massive lifeblood for our economy, creates major employment and much activity in local areas as well as nationally. It also provides a valuable service.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> However, there is a real problem. The costs for businesses increase continually and they are finding it difficult to access credit now. The banks are chasing those businesses that have performing credit to try to take that back off them. The cost of the increased rates is going out of control and getting more expensive. Business insurance has also gone up and in some cases by 20%. There are no proper reasons given and no proper explanations. I learned only this week that one excuse given by an insurance company was Storm Ophelia. That is the new reason for insurance premiums going out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> There is a reality here. I have spoken about it before. Insurance companies are operating in a cartel-type manner. I raised this at the Committee of Public Accounts before and I was cautioned for doing so. However, I am happy to hear so many Deputies raising the same issue and saying the same thing. We need to bring in more competition and open it up to European countries. We need to put manners on the insurance companies because there is no reason and no justification for what they are doing. Action is needed and it is needed urgently. I am calling on the Minister of State to bring action into play and deliver on this and other issues.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBrowne" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Deputy James Browne<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_843">Businesses throughout the country are facing crippling costs for insurance. I have dealt with many of them in Gorey, Enniscorthy, Wexford and New Ross. Charities, community groups and sports clubs are also badly affected. Many businesses have experienced substantial and unjustifiable insurance increases recently. With this in mind, I commend my party colleague, Deputy McGrath, on bringing forward this motion calling for urgent action to tackle rising insurance costs. Employer liability insurance, public liability insurance and motor insurance are becoming an unsustainable burden. Despite this, the Government is doing little to tackle this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> A good start for the Government to tackle the soaring costs for business insurance would be to create an index of insurance premium increases. The burden on businesses is bounded by the greater use of insurance excess and insurance exclusions. These are increasing the cost of insurance by the back door. Insurance fraud is another reason premiums are high. No data are currently collected or published by the Courts Services on the number of instances of fraudulent and exaggerated claims. In many instances, insurance companies are not challenging claims they believe to be dubious or potentially fraudulent. There is also a real and perceived lack of consistency in the awards handed out for personal injury claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> These are all issues that could and should be tackled by the Government. If it does not tackle these issues, it will push many of these businesses and organisations out of existence. There are steps the Government could take. It could work towards creating a single European market for insurance to better enable businesses to shop around. It could urgently complete the recommendations in the working group's report on the cost of employer liability and public liability insurance. It could tackle insurance fraud. It is not acceptable that the Government's inaction is affecting all types of insurance costs. We should not forget that our small and medium enterprises employ almost 1 million people. It is about 44% of those employed. I urge the Government to take action.</p>

        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_309">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_846">I thank Deputy McGrath for bringing this motion forward. However, we would not be here if Facebook or any of the big American companies were making this an issue. The Minister of State would dance to their tune immediately. However, this is an issue that is predominantly crucifying small businesses throughout the country. We are here because the Minister of State would not listen to the representations made by small businesses from around the country at the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. Our report is being allowed gather dust while businesses across the country are being fleeced by their insurance companies. They are using these small businesses to rebuild their balance sheets and cash reserves that were ruined by bad management decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> The Government cannot stand by and look at these kinds of increases - tens of thousands of euro each year - that effect many small businesses. It cannot continue to ignore that happening and the impact that it is having on small business owners and on employment creation. There was a much-derided ambition to make Ireland the best place in the world to do business by 2016. However, for many that did not happen because they were put out of business by not being able to afford insurance and not being able to reinsure. The Minister of State needs to act on the report. Settlements that are made out of court on a nod and wink basis, that businesses are being made to pay for, need to be published. We need to ensure that serial suers who claim against multiple businesses are highlighted, even if their cases are somewhat dubious.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> Urgency needs to be injected into dealing with this debate. I refer to the need for an urgency and understanding at Government level, and at permanent Government level, of the kind of increases that businesses are facing. People are either being forced out of business or to carry on their business without insurance. That is illegal in many cases. The Minister's inaction is forcing small businesses into illegal action. They just want to get on with the job of being a business. Is lá na Gaeilge é inniu, agus tá gnóanna beaga faoin bhrú céanna agus atá an teanga in Éirinn freisin. Do not give us the standard Government response. It is unfortunate that there is nobody from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation here. Do something about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">I want to dispel one thing that has been consistent from the Opposition, which is that the Government has done nothing on this. People are looking for a roadmap. There is a roadmap. There is the motor insurance report in conjunction with the report of the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC. I have been struck by one thing when meeting people, and since I have come into this job I have met the Irish Hotels Federation, IBEC, ISME, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association, RGDATA, Chambers Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, Insurance Ireland, the chief executive officers from the operating companies, representatives from Lloyds and others. Anybody who says this Government is not doing anything does not know what they are talking about. This is the report and there are 15 recommendations and 29 actions. All of the actions for quarter one will be concluded on time. All of the actions for quarter two are on track. We will have 26 of the 29 actions concluded by the end of the year and 12 of the 15 recommendations also by the end of the year. People should not mistake where we are making movements in the right direction with an action. We are dealing with things. We have moved a lot of difficult issues in conjunction with the motor insurance report. Make no mistake about that, please.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for the opportunity to speak on this. I am truly disappointed at the number of occasions that I meet people in respect of public liability and employer's liability and the number of people who come to meet me and do not even know about this report. I am always surprised on every occasion. It is important to understand that it is the cumulative effect of all of these actions, with the actions from the motor insurance report and the other reports, when we get them all done, that will have a major impact on the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">It is not just one or two silver bullets.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> The Minister for Finance is not in a position to direct insurers to provide cover or to provide it at a particular price. He does have a role in setting out a roadmap for reform for the sector as a whole, however. That is what these reports and their recommendations are designed to do. Ultimately, the overarching aim of the working group report is to ensure the insurance sector is stable and consistent, making it a more attractive place for new entrants. If this is achieved, there will be more competition and prices will become more affordable.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> This issue of increased competition is important. One point that has become clear from my engagement with business policyholders is the limited selection of insurers available to provide cover to them. In some instances, it is just one company and, quite often, that single company is based outside of the State. As a consequence of this lack of competition, the price of cover being charged is in some cases exorbitant. In turn, the business has no choice but to accept it because no one else is willing to offer any such cover. We must, therefore, make the market more attractive. That is why the working group believes the emphasis needs to be on ensuring consistency in award levels through the regular use of the book of quantum. If this objective can be achieved, then insurers can have greater certainty and predictability in reserving. This type of stability should encourage more companies, both domestic and from outside of the State, back into the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> An insurance award should be within the book of quantum, whether somebody chooses to conclude it without going to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or going down the legal route. That is what we must achieve. If we can do that, then we will have removed the outliers in which the insurance companies are obliged under the Solvency II directive to have higher levels of reserve. However, there is no single policy or legislative initiative which can immediately transform existing insurance pricing. Some actions require time to be implemented. For instance, those which require legislation to be put in place, such as a national claims information database, also require reform of existing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> We must challenge the insurance companies not to settle cases early. We have heard the same story from every single sector, be it refuse collection, marts, farms or retail, namely insurance premia go up when a claim is made. The circumstances in that are not acceptable. I met with the Minister for Justice and Equality today on amending section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004. This requires an initial warning letter to be sent to inform a defendant as early as possible about a claim. Currently, that stands at two months. We must reconcile this with new data protection rules under the general data protection regulation, GDPR. These will come into effect in May and will require CCTV evidence must be deleted in a period of time. If a claim is taken against somebody, the defendant must be informed about it to ensure any CCTV evidence is retained. This will allow people to be in a position to prepare a proper defence. Often, claims are made six or eight months after an incident but the video evidence has gone. Accordingly, the business has no method of defending itself appropriately. We must ensure this ends as quickly as possible. I met with the Minister for Justice and Equality today and we are on track to ensure this will be in place in six months to coincide with new data protection rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> Sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 deal with false evidence and fraudulent actions. Taking a claim against somebody is effectively a one-way bet. One can go to court, take a chance and try to get a big chunk of money from the insurers. However, they are not taking from insurers but from the pockets of everybody who pays insurance premia. This results in every premia being more expensive than it should be. In cases where a judge believes there is fraud or extreme exaggeration, he will make no award. However, this costs the person who made the claim nothing. We need an appropriate pathway between An Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Courts Service and insurers to ensure such a claimant does not walk out the door scot free and can chance it again the next time. That is one area in which we can prevent fraud. We have analysed sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 and we believe they are strong enough to provide for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> Much work has been done in this area but I have not been able to touch on all of it in the time allocated. People are not aware of the amount of work done. I have suggested to the Chairman of the Oireachtas finance committee that my officials and I would present to the committee to outline what we have done and what we intend to do. I intend to end the era of people taking a punt and screwing somebody over through a dodgy claim.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Casey<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_875">I welcome Deputy Michael McGrath's continued focus on the crippling costs of business and motor insurance. I also welcome the presence of business owners in the Visitors Gallery, as well as representatives from my industry, the hotel sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> The unsustainable increases in insurance premia have reached a stage where workable businesses with long-standing records in communities are now wondering whether they have a viable future. Regretfully in the hotel sector, public liability claims are now becoming the norm. I have almost 30 years' experience in the business and have witnessed various spikes in insurance costs over that time. What is happening today, however, I have never witnessed before. I had a public liability claim free record for over ten years until a relatively small claim two years ago. As a result of this, I witnessed in this two-year window an increase in insurance costs of over 200%. My costs have moved from a five-figure to a six-figure sum. No business can sustain that level of increase. The double whammy of an insurance system that receives its profits from premia from business owners, along with a legal system which sustains large claims for the smallest of incidents, incentivises this culture of claim and uncontested pay-out.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> The other injustice is the burden unfairly carried by the small business sector. Chains of hotels or group hotels, for example, carry a larger influence and weight with the insurance industry while the single operator is at its mercy.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">In Ireland we rely on small owner-operators. The Irish small and medium business sector is the foundation of our economic model but the current insurance regime is out of control and will close Irish businesses unless action is taken. That is why we have Governments. That is why we in this House are elected. If there is injustice in the market, we have a duty to fix it. I welcome the determination of Deputy Michael McGrath to focus on solutions in regard to insurance. I urge the Government to act.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">I welcome the motion and thank Deputy Michael McGrath, who has been dogged in pursuing escalating insurance costs, whether business or motor insurance, which is an ongoing issue we have been raising. I also acknowledge those in the Visitors Gallery, who are busy people who have taken time out from their own work to be here for the debate tonight. I am sure that after several hours here they are eager to be back in their own businesses, making things happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> I firmly agree with the motion that rising costs for employers through public liability insurance is a threat to the competitiveness of small businesses. I want to focus on the fact it is also a threat to the communities which these businesses serve. Right around the country we see that small businesses, very often family-owned businesses, are supplying up to 40% of the jobs. We know the National Competitiveness Council has stated the cost of doing business is a major concern for overall competitiveness. Many SMEs have experienced very large increases in business insurance and, in addition, insurance companies are using insurance excess and exclusions to protect themselves at the expense of the businesses. Constant pressure from overheads, including the rising cost of business insurance, is squeezing traders and eroding their income, and it is an influencing factor in regard to them reducing their services or even stopping. The pub may close the dance floor, the pool room or the meeting room, the café may not have a hangout area for teens, and public liability insurance may be too expensive for community groups who would have to stop holding a festival or a local parade. In the interests of these various community groups and businesses, action needs to be taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_881">I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing forward the motion on business insurance. I acknowledge the presence of all those in the Visitors Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> The arguments have been made and put in front of the Minister of State. The evidence is overwhelming and what we need now is action. There are 15 action points in the report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance that are due to be completed in the first half of this year. I ask the Minister of State to take action to implement them. We need to oblige insurers legally to provide a breakdown of the premium cost of the business and to provide more information to businesses on how premiums are calculated. We need to ensure the book of quantum is updated at least once every three years. We need to ensure the research on the book of quantum is based on medical evidence and cost, not solely on historical claims. We need to bring in tougher penalties, both financial and otherwise, for insurance fraud and claim exaggeration. We need to oblige insurance companies legally to notify policyholders of claims made against them before settlement, the amount a claim was settled for and the reason the claim was settled. We need to bring forward the deadline for the Department of Finance and the Central Statistics Office to report on the creation of a price index for employer and public liability insurance premiums and establish such an index. These are practical, doable suggestions. The time for talking is over. The time for action is now.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eugene Murphy<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_883">In the short time available to me, I want to refer to this issue in a practical way by giving three examples of situations I have dealt with since I became a Deputy in 2016. By the way, most of the work in my constituency offices in the past two years has been dealing with insurance issues, not alone motor insurance but also business insurance and now flood insurance, which is an area I have had to examine with Deputy Michael McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> I will give the example of a young man who wanted to start a taxi business in Carrick-on-Shannon. The cost of the insurance was €12,000 and, naturally, he had to abandon his plan. Another example is where parents bought a car for their student daughter. The 2004 car cost €3,000 and has passed the NCT perfectly, and what happens? They cannot get it insured, despite it being perfectly fit for the road. The third example is that of a local hotel which was purchased in recent years and for which I have lobbied. The public liability insurance had been €12,500 but in the second year it went up to €21,000 and it has now gone up to a whopping €52,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> I and everyone here can tell the Minister of State that the time for reports and that type of action is gone. We want real action. Unless that action occurs in the coming months - in other words, a reduction in insurance costs - many businesses like those represented here this evening will close. They are not able to take this hit. This whole area must be dealt with. We all talk about claims and, of course, there are many claims we can question. However, there is something else going on in the insurance industry that needs to be investigated. The Government needs to get to the bottom of this and deal with it. The book of quantum needs to be dealt with. It is extraordinary that some types of injury, or so-called injury, do not need to have medical backup.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> My time is limited and I have to hand over to Deputy Michael McGrath. While I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister of State, we have to act on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_887">I thank all of the contributors and again thank all of those who came to the Visitors Gallery to listen to the debate. What they will want to know is what the outcome of this will be, whether it will lead to any change and whether the Government will focus on delivery. That is what this has to be about. It is all very fine to pass a motion in the Dáil but it has to mean something. The Government has to focus on getting some short-term wins in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> We are operating in a vacuum because we do not have the information about premium increases affecting the business community, for example. The Minister of State should be taking a sample of businesses to track their insurance over a short period, and I encourage him to do that quickly. I also encourage him immediately to require insurance companies to explain to policyholders what they have done to challenge claims and the work they have done to get to the point where they make a settlement. It is a very practical step which is achievable. Where claims are made that insurance companies believe to be bogus, false, exaggerated or fraudulent, there should be an onus on them to refer those to the Garda immediately for investigation. If the Government takes those short-term steps while working on the longer-term policy issues as well, I believe we will make some real progress. We need the data and we need transparency. Some of the timelines in the action plan are not good enough. With regard to the national claims database, the Minister of State is talking about a report on the feasibility of including business insurance by the end of 2019, which is not good enough. It is the same with the CSO giving us the record of business insurance premiums. That is not good enough and the Government has to bring that forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> The Minister of State's party's mantra is a republic of opportunity. Those who are here tonight and many of those who are watching want the opportunity to continue in business and to continue to provide employment and services for their customers, and not be put out of business by exorbitant insurance costs. Surely they deserve that. We will certainly back them and I hope the Government will too.</p>

          <p eId="para_896">I ndiaidh an sínte i Mí Mheán Fómhair a chuaigh thart, bheadh an t-am suas ar 29 Márta i mbliana. Following an extension last October, the assembly's term is due to expire on 29 March 2018. The assembly has now considered four of the five topics listed in the resolution. The final meeting to consider the remaining item, that of fixed-term parliaments, was scheduled for the weekend of 3-4 March. However, due to the adverse weather conditions caused by Storm Emma, it was deemed necessary to cancel the meeting in the interest of safety concerns for assembly members, suppliers and staff. Rescheduling the meeting before the assembly's term expires has not proven possible due to the unavailability of members, with the St. Patrick's Day holiday, the approach of the Easter holidays and the difficulty in securing suppliers and a venue. The chair of the assembly, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, has therefore requested a further extension of the assembly's term to the end of April to allow for the completion of its work programme. Under the circumstances, I consider this request reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> The Citizens' Assembly and the Constitutional Convention before it have been bold and innovative exercises in deliberative democracy. Their work has helped inform and shape our political decisions. Tá siad tar éis léargas fiúntach a thabhairt dúinn maidir leis na rudaí atá tábhachtach do dhaoine agus na torthaí a bhainfeadh siad amach dá mbeadh na sonraí agus an t-am acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> The 99 citizens of the assembly have given a significant amount of personal time to considering the diverse and demanding topics put before it. The assembly's sessions are streamed live. Anyone who has listened in will realise the complexities involved and how thoroughly each topic to date has been considered. Gabhaim buíochas le baill an tionóil agus leis an gcathaoirleach fá choinne an sár-obair atá déanta acu agus an díograis a chur siad isteach. Tá an tionól neamhspleach den Rialtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> The assembly operates independently of the Government and decides on all matters relating to its operation, including its rules of procedure, arrangements relating to its membership, the timing of its meetings and, subject to the resolution passed by the Houses, the prioritisation of its work programme. Recognising the importance of the eighth amendment of the Constitution, the assembly devoted five weekends to consideration of this topic and submitted its report to the Oireachtas, which referred it to a committee of both Houses, as detailed in the resolution. Two weekends were accorded to consideration of how best we respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population and the report and recommendations have been submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The assembly considered over the course of two weekends how the State could make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change and a further weekend was devoted to considering the manner in which referenda were held.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> The work of the assembly to date has helped to inform and shape our political decisions. With one more topic to consider, the assembly is nearing completion of the work that we in the Oireachtas asked it to do. The assembly proposes that the final weekend meeting to consider fixed-term parliaments will take place before the end of April, subject to this short extension being approved by both Houses. Tá sé tábhachtach, fá choinne an tionóil, go mbeadh mí breise aige chun a chuid oibre a chur i bhfeidhm. Gabhaim buíochas fá choinne labhairt sa díospóireacht.</p>

          <p eId="para_902">I support this motion on behalf of my party and commend the Citizens' Assembly on its fantastic work. It has been a good exercise in citizen democracy and seen the engagement of a diverse range of citizens from across the country. They should be commended on taking time out of their lives and work. They travel from all over the country to meet and discuss important issues. I understand that they still have some time left to deal with the issue of fixed-term parliaments.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> With Storm Emma, we in this House had no problem closing up shop on the Wednesday and not sitting on the Thursday. We facilitated ourselves and the House's staff by rescheduling the work of that half day and Thursday for the week we returned. As such, why would we not facilitate the Citizens' Assembly doing the same? If we are happy to reschedule our own work due to an adverse and extreme weather event, why would we not extend the same courtesy to the members of the Citizens' Assembly and its staff, who have been asked to do a job of work and, through no fault of their own, were not in a position to complete that work due to this unforeseen event, which put people's lives at risk? Thankfully, we came through it as a nation. The request to extend the time for a brief period so as to allow the assembly to finish the work that it started - the work that it has been requested to do - is only reasonable and fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> The assembly's work to date has shown it to be a worthwhile endeavour. It has produced some opinions for discussion across the board. It has certainly raised eyebrows, engaged in debate in its meeting room and generated debate further afield. In that vein, I wholeheartedly support the time extension motion. We in this House had no problem rescheduling our own work to deal with Storm Emma. How then could we not extend the time for the Citizens' Assembly to do the same?</p>

          <p eId="para_906">I am happy to be able to speak this evening. I understand the point about Storm Emma and ensuring health and safety in the House. I am on the Business Committee and I supported the closure. However, I have a major issue with the Citizens' Assembly. This House is the citizens' assembly. Is é seo an top line, mar a deirtear, an Dáil agus an Seanad, and the people elect us.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> The Citizens' Assembly was a contrived setup from day one in order for the Government to slip around an issue that it could not deal with upfront. Set up the Citizens' Assembly and call in 99 people. The Government has been found out. There is a housing crisis. If someone builds a house on bad foundations, it will crack and fall. Eleven counties were left out of it, including mine, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's and many other rural counties. How could that be fair? Surely the basic prerequisite for RED C was to have one person - not even two people - from each county, yet it did not do that. The first day the assembly met, a person who was invited had to resign from it because of his political connections and canvassing on many issues, including repeal of the eighth amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> Why were so many substitutes needed? I am not saying anything about the people who joined the assembly. They were hand-picked. I am talking about the system. RED C was then caught with its pants down around its knees because it had failed in its duty to have a proper selection process. Thousands of people contacted me and the Minister of State seeking an independent inquiry. Instead, RED C is inquiring into itself and the mistakes it made. By its own admission, 99 people would never be representative of the voting populace. It was never going to happen, so that was a farce from day one.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> The assembly is considering other issues, but it was mainly set up for one reason, that being, the first one that it dealt with so zealously and with so much haste. It then passed that issue on to a contrived Oireachtas committee, but we are dealing with the assembly now. I have a reply to a parliamentary question on my person that states that it cost €1.8 million to service the assembly up to the end of 2017. How much more will it cost and why do we bother having elections to elect people? Like Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and others, I have the privilege for the moment to have been elected by the people of my county, but not to be ignored by a cabal that was wrongly formed in order to arrive at a contrived answer. When I met Deputy Enda Kenny the night before he was elected Taoiseach, he told me not to worry about the eighth amendment. I discussed it with him. I told him that I could not support his Government. He said we would have a citizens' assembly, then an Oireachtas committee and a free vote and everything would be hunky-dory, but the people can see what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">This extension of time is just another part of that. This is the second time.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> The prerequisite was honesty and that the integrity of the process should be upheld. RED C got found out on the question of the substitutes. I have asked why we needed so many substitutes. Why did people desert it after a certain time? Was it because they dealt with the issue they wanted to deal with which was the eighth amendment? One gets what one wishes for in this game. When there is a contrived and poor foundation and poor set-up, this is what we end up with - a kind of a mess, which is what it is. I have no gripe with any of the people on it - I do not know who or what they are - but I have a gripe with the way it was established and with the way they were contacted and the way they presented so zealously and enthusiastically. We needed so many substitutes. I want to find out. The Minister might tell me how many substitutes were required and why RED C could not even get that many - picking the 12 substitutes or whatever. Why could they not get them right and have a fair, honest, transparent, decent and workmanlike arrangement to get the people required? There are plenty of people out there who I am sure would be willing if they were asked.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> It is like the so-called Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment, which could not get a pro-life doctor yet one of them addressed 100,000 people last Saturday week in Dublin and she said she was not asked. Neither were countless others. It was contrived and it was a cabal as I call it.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> It is not democratic. This is a democratically elected House. Na hAirí Stáit might want to be laughing and joking away. They should laugh away if they want to and be disrespectful. The people are waiting.</p>

          <p eId="para_917">They might not like what I am saying but it is a fact. It fell down around their ears. The Government was caught napping and the people are out there waiting for it to deal with it when it comes back to the people. This is the Oireachtas and people are elected to it to deal with these issues. The legislation will decide whether we take away the last vestiges of humanity and respect that unborn people have through the eighth amendment. People will have a say in that. The Government cannot cod the people.</p>

          <p eId="para_918">I support the proposal to extend the time to give the Citizens' Assembly what it has asked for. It would be disrespectful to do anything other than that given its members have given up their time and there has been a great deal of preparation for the final piece of work they have to do. I also thank them for the work they have done and for giving their time freely and listening to all sides on the particular aspects they were asked to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> I was a member of the constitutional convention. It is onerous to spend a weekend every month dealing with issues and listening intently to all sides. The only criticism I have of that process is that the reports were not followed through on. It was a worthwhile exercise in advance of the all-party Oireachtas committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> There is nothing contrived about an all-party Oireachtas committee. It represents the shades of opinion in the House. I resent the label that has been put on it that it is in some way contrived. It is no such thing. It is made up of elected Members of the House who were nominated by their various groups. That is exactly what it was. Had the Citizen's Assembly delivered a result that Deputy McGrath liked, he would have had no problem with it.</p>

In accordance with precedence and Standing Order 151, consideration of sections 1 and 2 of the Bill will be postponed until the Schedule is disposed of. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKyne" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment" eId="spk_361">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (Deputy Seán Kyne)<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1692">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1693">"That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1694">The Galway-Mayo ducting and cables telecommunications network is a vital piece of State infrastructure located in an area of strategic importance for transatlantic traffic and with the potential to provide significantly improved broadband services in an area of the country underserved by broadband. It is built and is already in use to a limited extent to provide vital transatlantic connectivity for a multinational company. It is poised to meet its full potential and the Bill before the House is the key to the fulfilment of that ambition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1695"> The Bill before the House today has three principal objectives. The first is to provide for, and ensure, that the ownership of the ducting and cables and ancillary equipment vest in the Minister. The second is to give rights of access to private lands through which the ducting and cables pass. Both of those objectives ensure that the persons managing the network, the managed service entity, MSE, will be able to fully maintain and operate the network. The third is to minimise impacts to landowners along the route of the ducting and cables and to provide compensation and safeguards to those landowners arising from the use of their land. I propose to address each of those objectives in turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1696"> On the first objective, the ducting and cables are currently being used by way of an interim arrangement with Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, acting as the network manager. As part of that interim arrangement it was necessary to provide GNI with certain rights to use the network, including temporary ownership of the cable and ancillary equipment. Section 2 provides that the ownership of the ducting and cables and ancillary equipment will vest in the Minister on the coming into operation of that section. This will eliminate the potential for any legal doubt in that regard and any possible delay in the bringing into full operation of the network.</p>
          <p eId="para_1697"> The second objective is to provide rights of access to all lands through which the Galway-Mayo ducting passes. In 2005 during the planning of the Galway-Mayo gas pipeline by Bord Gáis Éireann, BGÉ, now GNI, my Department funded the installation of underground telecommunications ducting alongside the pipeline. The pipeline and ducting were installed between Ballymoneen in County Galway and the gas terminal constructed in Bellanaboy, County Mayo. Construction took place between 2006 and 2008. In 2013, Shell E&amp;P Ireland Limited, SEPIL, proposed to install fibre optic cable into the duct and to gift that to the State. This process concludes in quarter 1 of 2018. The ducting and cables traverse approximately 500 separate interests in land. GNI managed the ducting build and managed access to private lands for that purpose and also for the laying of the optical fibre cable. GNI acquired access rights over the majority of the private lands but not all. While the network is built, it cannot be fully managed, maintained or upgraded without securing access rights to all lands along the full route of the ducting and cables.</p>
          <p eId="para_1698"> Section 3 provides the Minister, and consequently the MSE, with the necessary rights to enter lands for the purposes of running the Galway-Mayo ducting and cables network. These access rights are described in Schedules 1 and 2 and are limited to those which are necessary to properly manage the ducting and cables network for telecommunications purposes. They are subject also to the obligations contained in Schedule 3. The access rights acquired by GNI on my behalf stand vested in me by virtue of section 3(2) while access to all other lands along and adjacent to the route are granted to me under section 3(3). Gas Network Ireland's rights stand protected by section 3(4) which ensures that GNI's other access rights over the lands such as access to the gas pipeline are unaffected and also section 3(5) which releases GNI from any obligations entered into regarding the access rights acquired by GNI on behalf of the Minister under subsection (2).</p>
          <p eId="para_1699"> Turning now to the matter of protecting landowner interests, sections 4 and 5 provide compensation and safeguards to landowners and ensure that any impacts arising from the presence and operation of the network are minimised. Section 4 provides for a claim for compensation by landowners in respect of any diminution in the value of their land arising as a consequence of the Minister's right of access to the land to tend to the ducting and cables. It provides all landowners along the route with the right to claim compensation on the same terms while also taking account of any moneys already paid as compensation by Gas Networks Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_1700"> Section 5 is broader in scope. It provides for a compensation scheme to be established in law to reimburse owners or repair damages caused by the MSE or others working on my behalf. This scheme also provides for landowners to be compensated for any such damages or any injury, loss or disturbance suffered by the owner and caused by the MSE or others in the performance of their duties. This scheme or any amended schemes will continue to operate for the entire lifetime of the ducting and cables. Section 5 also provides for regulations which set out the rules to be followed by the MSE and others working on my behalf in order to ensure minimal disruption to landowners and so that they are given adequate notice when works are planned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701"> Other safeguards also exist. Section 8 requires that a map of the route be deposited in my offices and made available for inspection by all interested parties. Section 9 ensures that information is given to all landowners and interested parties at least 28 days before enactment and including details of the legislation, the deposited map and how and where to make claims for compensation under section 4. Section 10 details the procedures to ensure that all notices are delivered to the intended parties. </p>
          <p eId="para_1702"> The Galway-Mayo region acts as a landing point for transatlantic cables. Through this Bill there is an opportunity to promote the growth of transatlantic data traffic and, more locally, to ensure that the Irish public, Irish industry and multinational organisations can access dark fibre and ultra-high speed broadband services in the west of Ireland. I am preparing to tender for an MSE to operate and manage the State owned Galway-Mayo telecommunications ducting and cables network via concession agreement. The Bill before the House is the missing piece in the jigsaw that will enable that tender to progress. Its enactment will ensure that the MSE will be able to gain the necessary access to the ducting and cables infrastructure to fully maximise the benefits of the network. Consequently, I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesLawless" eId="spk_362">
          <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1703">Fianna Fáil supports this Bill. We support all measures to improve connectivity to all areas that need it desperately. The measures within it are sensible, necessary, proportionate and will address broadband provision in Mayo and Galway. We had the same difficulties in Kildare North with broadband provision being inadequate in many cases. The problems are replicated in many areas throughout the country so we understand well the need for this Bill. Many of us have said that broadband is a basic service, no more than a power connection, a water supply to the house and other basic utilities were many years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1704"> While we support and welcome the Bill, it is specific to a particular project and area and it strikes me that there is potential to go a lot further. I introduced a Bill about a year ago, which has not progressed beyond Second Stage, that would tackle many of the issues raised in this Bill. I refer to site sharing and requiring operators to make available masts, ducting and the kind of materials referenced in this Bill on a national basis and to say that they can be laid once and used many times. It would require planning permission to take note of previous infrastructure in a particular area before a local authority decided to grant or decline an application. In other words, it would encourage and coerce, where necessary, operators to reuse kit and infrastructure so that many providers could use the one set of infrastructure. This would seem to make roll-out a lot easier, fast track roll-out in many areas and tackle many of the practical logistical difficulties that have bedevilled the national broadband plan and made commercial roll-out difficult. It is certainly commercially unviable in a great many areas. I may table amendments on Committee Stage along those lines. It seems there is an opportunity to merge the Bills or certainly take the good of both and submit them as amendments, so I may well return to that on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1705"> We know the national broadband plan is in difficulty, although I hope it is not in too much difficulty. We have had much debate in the House in recent months on where it is at now. We are well aware that it is down to one provider but the tender is yet to be awarded. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, said previously that it was good news because it would mean that shovels would be in the ground more quickly, which is a very optimistic way of looking at it, to put it mildly. I hope he is right because the rural communities and pretty much everyone in the State needs it, so I hope we get to that stage soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1706"> Previous performance is always an indicator of future outputs. In terms of previous targets, it was stated in 2011 that 90% of homes would be provided with broadband in 2015 and 100% by 2020. That is not on track. The target was reduced to 85% in 2016. Again, we are not on track for that. The Taoiseach recently stated that 75% of homes would be connected by the end of the year. That is 15% lower than was previously stated and it is three years behind schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_1707"> I will not labour the point but the national broadband plan is well behind. Its reach and timetable are well behind where it is supposed to be by now. We know it is in difficulty, with two of three tenderers withdrawing recently, but we wish it well because it is imperative that it succeeds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1708"> In the same vein, this Bill is a sensible set of measures to address a particular issue in a particular area. We will support it and vote accordingly, but it is essential that the same approach be taken on a national level. It is great that Galway and Mayo and the transatlantic cables will get the priority, but there is an entire country to be looked after as well. I may table amendments on Committee Stage but Fianna Fáil will be supporting the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1710"> The Bill is technical in nature. We believe the policy in the Bill, which achieves public ownership of telecommunications infrastructure, and the Minister of State's control over that, is sound. Sinn Féin believes in the vital need to have a modern telecommunications framework that would underpin and aid the development of what has become a basic service, namely, high-speed broadband. We know that service is needed in the west in the same way as it is needed everywhere else in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1711"> We are behind in the rolling out of the broadband plan. Hopefully, the procurement process will be completed fairly early in the year and that we will see work commencing. While broadband access should be a basic service, unfortunately, 542,000 households and premises are not any closer to knowing when they will get such access but, hopefully, that can be progressed. Our intention is to continue pushing for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1712"> On the specific provisions of the Bill, it will transfer control of Gas Networks Ireland land and infrastructure to the Minister and will create new interest in favour of the Minister. That seems to be a technical operation. It relates to the Corrib gas pipeline and to opening up the ducting already in place for other uses. However, what may not be technical in operation is the intention of future Ministers. When the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and I are no longer in this House, there will be the issue of the ownership of the ducting. It is crucial, therefore, that the powers are vested in the Minister under the Act regarding future actions taken with the ducting. That is the key aspect. The State needs to be in ownership of this continually for the benefit of the people, job creation and economic development, particularly in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713"> What the people of the State will gain from this measure is a different question. Will there be ongoing management to the benefit of the people? Will there be an income to the State from it because private companies will be using it? I understand the Minister stated in the Seanad that it is his intention to tender out the operation. I note that he has named an entity called the management service entity, MSE. It would seem that the intention in the Bill is to establish such an entity to oversee it, but there is a fear that this legislation could pave the way for future private ownership to make the ownership and the rights clearer and make it easier for the Minister, or future Ministers, to sell it off to the highest bidder.</p>
          <p eId="para_1714">There are many examples of failed private sales in telecoms. Unfortunately, the sale of Telecom Éireann in 1999, which I understand was presided over by the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, has left a bitter taste and bad legacy in terms of telecommunications infrastructure. As a result of that sale, the State lost out in respect of infrastructure, while citizens lost out financially. It is shocking that so much taxpayers' money was spent building a modern company that underwent a major transformation in the 1980s and early 1990s only to be sold off. As a result of the efforts made by Telecom Éireann workers at the time, we moved from having a completely outdated system under the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs to having the most modern telecommunications system in Europe, if not the western world, as overseas visitors and many people in the industry testified. We do not want a repeat of that scenario. We should not build up successful State assets to have them sold off for short-term gain. Privatisation and previous Governments' short-sightedness in telecommunications have impaired economic growth and failed citizens. If the telecoms system were still in public ownership, the national broadband plan would be much more straightforward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1715"> The privatisation model has failed in telecommunications and has not served citizens. We must not allow asset stripping. Ducting is an important asset for the State, particularly in the counties that will be served.</p>
          <p eId="para_1716"> With regard to the national broadband plan, 542,000 homes and businesses have been left high and dry by delays in the process of rolling out broadband. Farmers, students, business owners and ordinary householders have been left without a broadband service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1717"> Under the privatisation model, we have been strangled by private interests. This Bill creates a particular fear because it will be at a junction of private capitalist interest. We have the transatlantic cable and a growing number of data centres. While the jobs created through these new centres are welcome, the cabling provided for in the Bill will be in close proximity to the proposed data centre in Athenry. These projects encompass large international business interests whose influence should not guide future ownership of any State owned property. Such matters should be guided only by the best interests of the 4.7 million people in this State and the 6.6 million people living on the island. The best return for the people should be the primary objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1718"> Communications infrastructure will prove essential to economic development, as has been demonstrated over the years. We must strive to have the best possible telecommunications system because, as an island nation, we are out on a limb and need fast and efficient communications networks to overcome this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1719"> Quality of life issues are felt most in rural Ireland where any economic development will also be underpinned by the development of modern communications. Maintaining ownership of communications infrastructure in the hands of the State would give greater control in the interests of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1720"> Large corporations will be involved in this area. In the past, such companies had significant influence. While everyone is entitled to lobby, we must not forget those whom we have been elected to serve because they are the most important people at the end of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1721"> The development of ducting 13 years ago on the instruction of the then Minister was one of the few acts in public policy in recent years that has lent itself to State ownership of telecommunications. The greater public ownership model for telecommunications must be urgently considered and should be the priority path for the national broadband plan. A motion, amended by me, was passed in the House last month. It called for an examination of the feasibility of progressing the national broadband plan through the public ownership model. Under the current model, the number of bids has been reduced to one, which swings the pendulum in terms of bargaining power towards corporate interests and away from the Oireachtas and Minister, although he may protest that the contrary is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1722"> While the Bill deals with one artery of infrastructure, we must set about this properly given that we are starting from scratch. We should use the ducting systems for the best purposes in terms of public ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1723"> The Bill deals in part with gas infrastructure. Infrastructure is also being installed along water pipelines owned by Irish Water. A cabling and ducting system runs alongside the railway network and some cabling also runs alongside motorways, which are owned by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, formerly known as the National Roads Authority. I presume this cabling will remain in State ownership. Who owns the ducting in place alongside railway lines? Some of this is being used as a backhaul system for the metropolitan area networks, MANs. We also have gas pipelines. I am trying to convey to the Minister of State that there is a significant amount of ducting infrastructure in place. Who owns this infrastructure? Will the agency to which the Minister of State referred manage all of it? Will the taxpayer receive a return on this expensive infrastructure? If companies use it, will local authorities or the Department receive revenue? People will ask this question because it is important. We also have a large State owned electricity network which criss-crosses the landscape. We must consider how this infrastructure can be utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1724"> The metropolitan area networks operate in 90 towns and are supplied by the backhaul system. I understand the MANs are in State hands. Is it the Department's intention to draw all of this infrastructure together in a uniform system at some point? The more one studies this matter, the more a picture emerges of a complex tapestry of ducting being run by different infrastructure, whether roads, railways, Irish Water or, as in this case, the gas network. How will it be used to assist in rolling out the national broadband plan, which we all want completed quickly? To what other uses can it be put? Will a dividend be paid to the State or local authorities by companies which gain access to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1725"> As I indicated, Sinn Féin will table some amendments. The spirit of the Bill is good and we will support it. I would like the areas to which I alluded strengthened to ensure there is no risk of this valuable infrastructure being sold off for short-term gain or for other short-sighted reasons. I ask the Minister of State to address that issue. I look forward to the Bill's passage. </p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (Deputy Seán Kyne)<recordedTime time="2018-03-21T20:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1726">I thank Deputies for their contributions, particularly their constructive input to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">It is clear those who spoke see the importance and relevance of dark fibre and ultra-high speed broadband to rural Ireland and in particular to the Galway and Mayo region. As they pointed out, it relates to all areas in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1728"> The support of Members of this House, as was mirrored in the Seanad, has allowed the Bill to pass to the next Stage and it is certainly very welcome. During their contributions Deputies raised a number of issues and they discussed the possibility of putting down amendments on Committee Stage, as is their right. We will engage with those at the time or before that if there are specific matters that Members wish to discuss with officials from the Department. That can be arranged as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1729"> The premise of the Bill is about ensuring that the infrastructure already in place is retained in State ownership. The short section 2 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1730">All the right, title or interest of any person to or in the ducting and cables laid on, over or beneath the surface of land that consists of any part of the route shall, on the coming into operation of this section, stand vested in the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731">It is quite clear the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the ducting in question is retained in State ownership. It is quite specific.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732"> Both Deputies mentioned other areas in the country. I know we recently launched the mobile phone and broadband task force for 2017 and a work plan for 2018. There has been cross-party engagement with entities such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and it is acknowledged that there are areas in the country where new ducting was laid as part of new motorway construction or upgrading where there were gaps in infrastructure. Ensuring that the State has control of vital infrastructure such as ducting is very important, and that task force is dealing with that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1733"> To extend this legislation to the national broadband plan would require a Bill to provide access rights to all lands in the country, effectively. Subject to obligations around compensation payments and reparation for damages etc. this would appear to be the "nuclear" option, giving rise to huge costs and having an unnecessary impact on property rights and the implications far beyond the current Bill. This Bill deals with a specific section of cabling between Bellanaboy and a location in Galway. The ducting and cabling is there and in use so this is about ensuring the State has control over that. It is why we are progressing with the managed service entity and we will go to tender to allow this entity to manage the cable in the interests of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1734"> The plan will be for the managed service company, MSC, to operate and manage the State-owned Galway to Mayo telecommunications ducting and cables network via concession agreements. The Bill before the House is the missing piece of the jigsaw that will enable the tender to progress. The Bill's enactment will ensure the managed service company will be able to gain the necessary access to the ducting and cables infrastructure to maximise fully the benefits to the network. It is important that this is acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1735"> With regard to ducting in other areas, anything operated by a State or semi-State company is in State ownership. We can get further clarification on rail-----</p>

We will revert to the Deputies or give the answers on Committee Stage as it is a valid point and critical infrastructure should be retained by the State.

We must acknowledge the importance of allowing the MSC to progress and I ask that Deputies support the passage of the Bill.</p>
