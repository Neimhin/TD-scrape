#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	3	A Cheann Comhairle, I received your letter at lunchtime outlining the reason my priority questions have been disallowed. I have spoken to you on the telephone about this matter but I find this situation most unsatisfactory. If priority questions in particular are to be disallowed, some notification should be given to the Deputy concerned. This matter should be raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Notwithstanding that, this practice allows the Minister to avoid questions and results in less accountability in this House. Regrettably, the Minister did not come before the committee on health and children on the question of SARS and the fact that our questions on SARS and the public health doctors issue—

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	5	It is important that you listen to us, a Cheann Comhairle, and in future rectify this situation.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I wish to record my objection to the removal of a priority question tabled by the main Opposition spokesperson and the Green Party spokesperson. It was erroneously removed and I have argued that point with you, a Cheann Comhairle. However, what I really object to is the grave discourtesy shown to me. I have not yet received your letter, although I accept that it may be in the pigeon hole since lunchtime. The reality is that I was in touch with the General Office and with your office yesterday on several occasions and nobody took the time or the courtesy to inform me that one of my questions might have to be withdrawn. That situation is intolerable. It means, in effect, that the issue I want to raise, which is of national and international importance, will not now be discussed. You must take up this matter, a Cheann Comhairle, and ensure that it never happens again.I take exception to the suggestion that I should have put down a number of priority questions. It makes a farce of tabling a priority question if I have to put down a number of questions in order for one to be chosen. I tabled a priority question last Monday, and last Friday I put down a matter for this evening's Private Members' business. Your office, a Cheann Comhairle, and the General Office knew that both questions were tabled but nobody took the time to accord me the courtesy of a telephone call.I draw your attention, a Cheann Comhairle, to Standing Order 34(1) which states:The Ceann Comhairle shall examine every Question in order to ensure that it conforms with the provisions of this Standing Order. The Ceann Comhairle shall rule out of order any Question which does not comply with Standing Orders: Provided that the Ceann Comhairle, or the Clerk under his or her authority, may amend any Question after consultation with the member responsible for the Question, to secure its compliance with Standing Orders.I was not accorded that courtesy nor given that opportunity, and that is my objection.

I do not accept that ruling in my case because the questions were submitted before the debate on health in Private Members' time was decided. It is a discourtesy to Members of the House to find that the time and energy they put into tabling questions on the Order Paper is wasted because they are set aside. It was decided many years ago in this House that the anticipatory rule would not apply. The intention to change the rules is not acceptable.This is not a personal attack on the Minister but I received a telephone call from his office regarding questions on health looking for clarification on the question being raised. I tried to be helpful only to find that my question was then disallowed. I put it on record that when Ministers seek the assistance of the Opposition in future they will not get it if that is the way we are to be treated.

A number of questions to the Minister for Health and Children, including those of the Deputies, were ruled out of order as they anticipated the debate on the Private Members' motion before the House this evening.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I dispute that.

That is a matter for Dáil reform. Deputy Durkan pointed out there was some agreement in the past – I do not know where – to remove the rule relating to anticipation.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	11	That is correct.

The Chair ruled in accordance with the Standing Order. My ruling stands.Deputy Gormley said he would like the matter brought before the Committee on Procedures and Privileges while Deputy Olivia Mitchell said it was a matter for the Chair, which is not the case. If the Whip of Deputy Gormley's party wishes to bring the matter before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that is fine, and if the committee on Dáil reform wishes to change the Standing Order, that is equally fine, but the Chair is obliged to implement the Standing Order as it stands. We are moving to Question No. 55.

#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Amnesty report, Mental Illness – The Neglected Quarter, published earlier this year acknowledges the significant advances made in this country in the provision of community psychiatry, nursing services, community residences, day hospitals and day centres since the publication of the landmark 1984 report, Planning for the Future.Between 1999 and 2002, an additional €70.7 million was invested in the mental health services. In the current year, additional revenue funding of €7.6 million will be provided for ongoing improvements in mental health services; to develop and expand community mental health services; to increase child and adolescent services; to expand the old age psychiatry services; to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals; and to enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.Approximately €190 million in capital is being provided over the lifetime of the national development plan to fund the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals, as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. Substantial progress has been made. A total of 19 psychiatric units attached to general hospitals are operational and a further two units will become available to their mental health services in the near future.With regard to community residences, there are approximately 400 community psychiatric residences providing more than 3,000 places. This compares to 111 residences, providing less than 1,000 places in 1984. With regard to day hospitals-day centres, there are approximately 200 providing more than 3,500 places. This compares with 39 such centres providing approximately 1,200 places in 1984.Additional Information.The Mental Health Bill was enacted in July 2001 and will significantly improve safeguards for mentally disordered persons who are involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care and treatment. The Act will bring Irish law in this area into conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The main vehicle for the implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 is the Mental Health Commission, which was established on 5 April 2002.The Mental Health Commission has an important role to play in improving the quality of our mental health services. The primary functions of the commission are to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure the interests of detained persons are protected. The commission is working, along with officials from my Department, to put in place the structures required for its new role. The commission will shortly appoint an inspector of mental health services. The inspector will be required to visit and inspect all approved centres at least once a year. The inspector's annual report and review of the mental health services will be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, along with the commission's annual report.The health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, includes a commitment to prepare a national policy framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services, updating the present policy document, Planning for the Future, which was published in 1984. All areas of service provision and mental health policy will be examined in the course of this work. It is intended that this process will begin shortly.Funding has been made available to support groups and organisations such as Schizophrenia Ireland, Mental Health Ireland, GROW and Aware to heighten awareness and develop support services for service users and carers. In a concrete expression of the Government's commitment in the health strategy to develop advocacy services in mental health, €251,000 was provided by my Department to health boards and voluntary agencies for this purpose in 2002. An additional €100,000 was provided in 2003.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Does the Minister of State accept the inattention paid by the Government, outlined by Amnesty International, to a series of national and international reports critical of its failure to fully respect the human rights of people with mental illness? Does he further accept Amnesty International's statement that Ireland is in contravention of more than ten international treaties on human rights by virtue of the service provided to the mentally ill? There is a severe shortage of psychologists currently. How many vacancies exist? How many people are in training to become clinical psychologists?
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I do not have the exact number but I am aware that there are some additional places in UL and other colleges in regard to psychological services. I agree that there has been a lack of provision of these services. Apropos of the Amnesty report, the Government accepts and acknowledges that there are, and have been, grave deficiencies in the services in the mental health area.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	24	And there continue to be.

Unfortunately, the lack of provision of services has existed for quite a long time. Both the last and the present Government have, as I outlined in my reply, invested a huge amount of resources and have provided a significant number of residential and community places as the Deputy is aware. I fully subscribe to the Deputy's view that sufficient work has not been done in the mental health area and I share his concern. I am sure it is the concern of every Deputy.The Amnesty report also acknowledges that the lack of provision of services, and this is no excuse, is not particular to Ireland but is a world-wide phenomenon. The Government has provided, is providing and will continue to provide more services. As I said previously to Deputy Neville, it is not all about resources. In our health board area we have a particular problem which has nothing to do with resources. The Government has provided €2 million to fund a beautiful establishment which would allow 37 or 38 patients to leave St. Joseph's Hospital. The unit is fully furnished and ready but an industrial relations problem is delaying implementation.I have done everything in my power to advance the issue. I have spoken to both the unions involved and the Mid-Western Health Board to expedite the matter. These discussions have now gone on for well over a year or year and a half and, unfortunately, progress is slow. This is just one example of where provision has been made for services and where 36 patients have already been selected to move out into the community. The services are there for them and the money has been provided. I understand the same thing is happening in other health board areas.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	26	It is disingenuous to blame industrial relations in view of the fact that the health budget has been reduced for mental health services from 15% to 7% in the space of ten years.

As I said in my reply, an unprecedented level of funding has been put into the mental health services in the lifetime of both this and the previous Government. The figures are there to prove it.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I have on a number of occasions acknowledged that this is a year of greater pressure in the health services and that the health sector will have to manage service plans during 2003 in order that spending is contained within the approved level. Given the significant level of additional investment in services up to and including 2002, and the fact that the actual exceeded the planned activity level in 2002, the structuring of overall service plans by health agencies for 2003 was always going to involve some containment of service activity in order to manage within budget. Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996, otherwise known as the accountability legislation, health agencies are required to deliver a level of services consistent with their approved budgets. In a system that is demand-led and driven, in part, by high technology, any approach other than that set down in the legislation would create chaos in the health services. It would, ultimately, lead to the return of significant unapproved expenditure resulting in cash pressures which was the very reason why the 1996 legislation was introduced in the first place. It would also undermine the entire service planning process that is a key feature of the legislation and is a very positive aspect of the services since 1996. In regard to specific services both the ERHA and the Dublin academic teaching hospitals have identified the areas of cancer, cardiovascular and renal as high priority specialties which should be protected as far as possible.The level of capital investment for the five major academic teaching hospitals which has been invested in recent years or is planned amounts to €781 million. This is a significant sum by any standards and reflects the Government's commitment to providing for a high quality level of service in these hospitals. The ERHA will report to my Department shortly on the overall position and a meeting between it and officials of my Department will take place this afternoon. A subsequent tripartite meeting between my Department, the ERHA and the Dublin academic teaching hospitals will be held to discuss the difficulties facing the health services this year.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Does the Minister suffer from amnesia? Not long ago he publicly promised there would be no cutbacks in the health service. Does he remember giving an undertaking that services this year would be maintained at last year's levels? Yesterday he stated he did not consider there was a crisis in the hospital service, despite the announcements by the five major Dublin hospitals. What does he regard as a crisis? Does he not believe we are now in a grave situation and that patient care is being severely undermined by the savage reductions in service the hospitals in question are being forced to undertake? Is he aware that 250 beds are being taken out of the system and staff hours have been reduced? Has he read the statement from the five teaching hospitals which states the actions being forced on them by the Government will impact on the fabric of the service?How will the Minister explain to cancer and cardiac patients that the diagnosis of their condition will be delayed or its treatment denied? How can he stand over a position in which hospital wards are being closed when they are needed most and operations will not be carried out on seriously ill patients because he proved incapable and incompetent in terms of safeguarding and protecting hospital budgets? How did he allow this to happen?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Since I became Minister for Health and Children, I have been responsible for securing record increases in health funding and funding for acute hospitals across the country. As it happens, I have been criticised for this in some commentaries of late. The increased expenditure invested in our hospitals has resulted in increased activity levels and outputs. I defy any Member to state that cancer, cardiac and renal services have not vastly improved and expanded in the past four to five years in Dublin teaching hospitals and other hospitals across the country.The word "crisis" has been used. Language is cheap. I have heard the word "crisis" used to describe the health service for the past five or six years.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Last year, the original allocation to the Dublin teaching hospitals was of the order of €795 million. The original allocation this year is some 9.6% higher. Admittedly, the original allocation in 2002 increased during the year and the outturn was higher, as it is every year. Yesterday's statement by the Dublin academic teaching hospitals, which I received around midday, compares the original allocation this year to the outturn last year. This is not a fair comparison in some respects. Last year once-off expenditure was allocated to the Dublin teaching academic hospitals.

#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The policy of the Department of Health and Children in relation to services for older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies; to restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent; to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies; and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home. The role of the home help service is vital to this policy.Following the publication in 1998 of the report entitled The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, I am pleased that there has been a major step forward in the implementation of the home help scheme from 1999 onwards, both in terms of the amount of service delivered and treatment of the home helps themselves. On the latter point, the days when home helps worked for a pittance are long gone. I was instrumental in changing that. Upwards of €30 million has been injected into the system to ensure that home helps receive a decent level of pay and other entitlements, such as holidays and sick leave. On the service side, an additional €7 million has been made available to the health boards to increase the level of home help service availability through the employment of more home helps or by increasing the number of hours worked by existing home helps.I am pleased to inform the House that the total increase in expenditure on the home help service across all health board areas since 2000 is in excess of 114%. The breakdown in each health board area in 2003 compared with 2000 is as follows: 45% in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area; 107% in the North-Eastern Health Board area; 153% in the North-Western Health Board area; 147% in the Midland Health Board area; 131% in the Mid-Western Health Board area; 155% in the South-Eastern Health Board area; 154% in the Southern Health Board area; and 122% in the Western Health Board area.Additional InformationThe overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and that is reflected in the Estimates and the budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintain existing levels of service across all service programmes, including the home help service.There are a number of reasons there is an increased demand on the home help service, which included the demographic fact that approximately 6,000 people are coming into the over 65 bracket every year and also there is, proportionately, a bigger percentage increase in the more dependent over 80 category. These factors may necessitate some minor adjustments in the provision of the home help service.The only health board or authority where 2003 expenditure on the home help service is down on the 2002 figure, to any significant degree, is the North-Eastern Health Board. This is because the board overspent its home help budget in 2002 to the sum of €800,000 and, in accordance with accountability procedures, that amount had to be drawn down against the 2003 allocation. I have been assured by all health boards that the provision of the home help service is organised on the basis that the more vulnerable clients are given priority.

He should go back to 1930. We are talking about the effect of budget cutbacks in 2003 compared with the service provision in 2002. That is the nub of this matter. Is the Minister of State aware – I must ask the question because nothing he said leads me to believe he is aware – of the devastating effect cutbacks in the provision for health boards for home help service throughout the jurisdiction is having on service users and on those who depend on home help care, such as the aged, people with infirmities and those with disabilities? Has the Department done any estimate of the cost in terms of residential or in-patient care which the many thousands of recipients of home help incur in terms of the Exchequer on an annual basis? Is there any appreciation or realisation of the many millions of euro which are saved annually through the provision of care in the home and the community? Nothing in the Minister of State's reply leads me to believe he is aware of that. Some 85,000 hours will be cut this year in the North-Eastern Health Board area.

How does the Department monitor the effect of this in terms of the daily lives of those who are dependent on home help, many thousands of whom are now left alone and without the care they received in 2002 and previous years? We are in a backward spiral.

What is he doing to address this issue?
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I have a long association with the good work of the home help service. The Deputy referred to my awareness of the service's work and the costs of residential care. I am fully au fait with the good work of the home help service in every health board region.As I said, the policy of the Department of Health and Children in relation to services for older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes. I also said that the role of the home help service is vital to this policy. Let us be clear about that.I gave figures on the percentage increases in the allocations to health boards to provide home help services. The only health board where expenditure on home help services is down to any significant degree on the 2002 figure is the North-Eastern Health Board. That is because it was the only board which overspent its home help budget in 2002, doing so by €800,000. In accordance with accountability procedures, this had to be drawn down against the 2003 allocation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 63 and 81 together.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	60	As these are three oral questions, not more than 18 minutes is allotted.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I presume the Deputies are referring to recent media reports arising from the apparent leaking of drafts being considered by the task force on medical staffing.I established a national task force on medical staffing in February 2002 to make recommendations about how best to organise hospital medical staffing within the hospital system, having regard to the requirement of the European Working Time Directive to reduce the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospitals doctors. The first report of the task force is not yet finalised. When it comes to hand I will consider its recommendations and bring proposals to Government in the normal way.As far as I am concerned there is no question of the closure of any of our acute hospitals. However, as indicated in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness, there is a need to review the configuration of our acute hospital system, including the location of the particular services or specialities. This work will be taken forward by the National Hospitals Agency on its establishment.My commitment to the acute hospital system is evident in the significant increase in acute hospital bed capacity that I have approved. During 2000-01 my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs.The Government decided, on foot of the report entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. Last year I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals, which represents a 6% increase in capacity and 520 of these beds are in operation. The remaining beds will be brought into use shortly. My Department is currently examining the regional issues associated with the allocation of the remainder of the 3,000 acute beds.The acute hospital system in general is experiencing increased pressure on services due to a number of factors, including the growth in population, the availability of in-patient beds and the increasing number of elderly people who have a higher than average length of stay. The pressure on the hospital system is particularly evident in hospitals providing accident and emergency services.In 2002 there were some 1.2 million attendances at emergency medicine departments throughout the state. It has also been established that approximately 70% of all hospital admissions come through emergency medicine departments. Therefore, I am very conscious of the central function of these departments within the acute hospital system.I have provided capital funding in recent years to the ERHA and the health boards to support the development and refurbishment of emergency medicine departments. For example, new construction is taking place at Cork University Hospital and Tullamore General Hospital and at accident and emergency departments at a number of other hospitals. Funding has also been provided to support a range of initiatives such as the provision of minor injuries units and chest pain clinics in some of the major Dublin hospitals.I have also approved the recruitment of up to 29 additional emergency medicine consultants. Nineteen of these new consultants are in place throughout the country and the remaining ten posts are being progressed by the ERHA and the health boards. The increased availability of senior medical staff will facilitate rapid clinical decision-making, enhanced management, diagnosis and treatment of patients.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I put it to the Minister that morale in many hospitals and in maternity and accident and emergency centres throughout the country is at an all time low because of threatened downgrading in the imminent report now due. When will the report be received and will the Minister publish it?On specialties, are we talking about the services provided in some of the smaller hospitals, such as cancer services? Are such services to be centralised in the major regional hospitals and taken out of communities where support services are currently in place? Is that what is meant by the definition of regional specialties?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Yes, we will publish the national task force report on medical staffing as part of the wider health service reform programme which deals with structural and financial reforms. Members need to stand back and not rush to judge by using phrases such as "downgrading local hospitals" and "downgrading local services". They should not create illusions about what those local services mean on a day-to-day basis.The medical manpower report deals with improving quality of service, patient care and health outcomes. The Deputy asked about cancer services. Cancer surgery should not be undertaken in every hospital in the country and no one in the House should advocate that. Proposals will be made by Hanly on the fundamental reconfiguration of services such as cancer and heart surgery and, in some instances, renal surgery. Other areas of activity of major speciality levels require a significant throughput of patients to provide a caseload for doctors and consultants who can then build up their expertise and work in accordance with international best practice. That is the ultimate objective of the task force. It should be seen in a positive light in terms of improving the quality of health for people treated in our hospitals.

I express the hope that you will find your visit to be interesting, successful and to our mutual benefit.

Unfortunately, when we cannot access information it is very difficult to know exactly what the Minister means by configuration. The Minister says we are scaremongering by using terms such as downgrading and closure. A great deal of what has happened, in particular in the North-Eastern Health Board region, is done by stealth and in piecemeal fashion. We do not work out what is happening. We must look at what configuration means. The local needs of communities must be balanced by the centre of excellence approach. Certain medical procedures can be provided by smaller hospitals in uncomplicated cases.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The Deputy must ask a question.

Downgrading services in hospitals and moving to centres of excellence may increase anxiety because journey times can also increase. It is important that other reports such as the Brennan and Prospectus reports are published so that we can find out what is being proposed. These are significant issues for the local communities involved. I am particularly concerned about obstetric and paediatric services.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The purpose of Question Time is to elicit information from the Minister. A number of Deputies are offering. It is not appropriate for the Deputy to make a long contribution.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I agree with that, but it is difficult for us to get hard and concrete facts as to what the Minister has in mind for the health services.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Too much spin.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Everything involves producing a report or coming up with a new idea, but nobody can sit down and say, "If you read that now, you will know what will happen with the health services."  We thought that was what the health strategy was about, but that seems to have gone by the wayside as well and we are now relying on—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Deputy Twomey, you are using your colleagues' time making what appears like a Second Stage speech.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	73	That is true, I would agree with the Ceann Comhairle in some respects.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I would remind the Deputy that this is Question Time; perhaps he would give way to Deputy Gormley.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Is the Minister aware that up to 40% of babies are born in the three major maternity hospitals in Dublin, that these hospitals are among the largest in Europe and that this has real cost implications? All the evidence is showing that the larger the institution, the more it actually costs. Why, therefore, is the Minister centralising even more services? It does not seem to make sense. The Minister is the one who gives out about the costs which must be incurred as a consequence.Would the Minister agree that the Irish model of maternity care is highly interventionist in its character and that this also has cost implications? We know that Caesarean sections, for example, cost three times as much as an ordinary delivery. Is this an area the Minister feels he can influence? Is it possible at this stage to get away from this interventionist style which has evolved in this country? That would enable us to have more natural births and also to reduce costs significantly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I agree to a certain extent with Deputy Twomey's points on the need to balance the needs of patients, in rural communities in particular, in terms of access to services but also in terms of provision of transport, accommodation and facilities which will mean that the referral on to specialist centres will not represent the degree of inconvenience which it does at present.From what I understand of it so far, the Hanly report – there have been different drafts and the final draft is not completed – is not recommending the closure of the major maternity hospitals which have more than 1,000 births. In terms of configuration of services, the report basically maps out what certain size hospitals should be doing, what is appropriate, safe and best for those particular hospitals to do in order that they then can go away and do it properly, and then what is best, safe and appropriate for other hospitals. That is what we mean by the configuration of services.By definition, many hospitals will not be doing everything. The Deputy is correct in terms of minor surgical procedures and issues like that which can be done, but in my view that is not possible with some of the major specialties at the other end of the scale to which I referred earlier. Nor is it desirable that, for example, certain cancer procedures or surgical oncology interventions in regard to cancer of the colon, lung or pancreas would be carried out in a hospital where a consultant may do only ten a year – we will be dealing with that in a later question. I would not be happy about that from a safety or quality point of view.While we have come a long way with cancer services, we still have some distance to go. I believe in the idea of having centres of excellence for cancer treatment and, ultimately, the patient will too. If any patient out there had a choice upon diagnosis to honestly answer the question "Where would you like to go, what would be the first priority for you in terms of accessing a service?", he or she would say, "I want to go to the place that gives me the best chance of surviving this". That is the fundamental question we all must ask ourselves in terms of how we plan and prepare the new services, ideas – these are not necessarily new ideas – or proposals which will emerge from the medical task force and the Hanly report. As a society we need to honestly face up to that and perhaps bite a number of bullets in the process. No doubt it will be politically challenging.On maternity services, one must look at the evolution of the maternity, midwifery and obstetric services over recent decades or over the past 100 years. There has been a tremendous improvement in safety, survival rates and infant mortality over the past 20, 30 or 40 years. There are other pressures on obstetricians and consultants, some of which are insurance-led, which may be one of the factors related to increased intervention. When one considers the tremendous developments in neo-natal care for example, one begins to understand why we need centres of excellence in the maternity area. That is not say it is not possible to have midwifery-led units and some health boards are now making proposals on that front. We are developing a nursing and midwifery strategy in the community which is nearing completion.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I hope it will be very shortly. The nursing division of my Department has been working on that for quite some time in consultation with all the interested parties. Many births can happen in the community without any difficulty. We have had a very good scheme in Holles Street, the evaluation of which I launched recently. This has been quite a success in terms of a midwifery-led development under consultant protocols. It seems to marry the best of both worlds with clear safe protocols in place.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Would the Minister like to comment on the fact that the midwifery-led scheme in Galway has been collapsed? Following his comments on reorganisation in hospitals, does the Minister not accept it is silly for him to ask for a positive response from us when we have not seen the report? As we all know three major reports are due to be published. Is the Minister aware that some of these reports were initially promised to be available last February? It is now May and we are still waiting. When will the Hanly report be published? Surely the Minister would accept it makes debate very difficult when he can give quite wide-ranging comments on a report but refuses to publish it. When will these three reports be published?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I cannot give a specific date. The Hanly team expects to complete its work around mid May. Some fine-tuning might be required after that. A further meeting of the group will take place in the middle of May so obviously it will be a number of weeks after that. It has been a very wide-ranging exercise involving about 300 meetings and consultations. Some elements of the report have been leaked which has led to a debate, which is understandable. However, I ask people to hold judgment until the report is published. I am commenting because I am answering questions about maternity, accident and emergency services, and so on. These are legitimate questions asked by Deputies in response to the leaking. It is too soon to have public meetings about something that is not contained in any report and that has been happening throughout the country.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	81	There will be many of them after it is published.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Deputy would be disappointed with public meetings at the moment.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I asked when the reports would be published.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I have given the time scale for the Hanly report. There is an issue as to whether we should do the three together along with the Prospectus Strategy Consultants report and the Brennan report on financial reform of the health service. All three together could be a significant mouthful to digest in one week. However, we are looking at a six-week period. Obviously the plan is for them to go to Government first for approval.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Does the Minister acknowledge that changes in training rules being implemented by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland as signalled by the Irish Medical Organisation have been in the offing for some considerable time? What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that current provision of accident and emergency services throughout the hospital network in the State will continue unaffected by these changes and that people in communities and all of us traversing the country have a guarantee that those accident and emergency services will remain in place?The situation in the Monaghan and the North-Eastern Health Board region has been referred to on a number of occasions this afternoon. The hospital in my community in County Monaghan has remained off call for almost 12 months. Ambulances responding to accidents in our immediate community cannot deliver patients to Monaghan General Hospital but are obliged under diktat of the health board to bring those patients a considerable distance to other hospitals at some considerable risk, as we have only too sadly recorded in our community. What is the Minister doing to ensure the restoration of Monaghan General Hospital to on-call status? Will he ensure that accident and emergency services and, indeed, the level of maternity care that our community both demands and deserves, are provided there.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I do not interfere with the protocols issued by the Royal College of Surgeons in terms of accrediting hospitals for training purposes, in particular training for non-consultant hospital doctors, the quality of that training and so forth. The key principle of the Hanly report is to move to a consultant-provided service as opposed to a consultant-led one which is what we have at the moment. We are currently too dependent on doctors in training which is giving rise to the annual or biannual problems in many hospitals around the country in regard to whether they will have junior doctors, they will get accreditation and so on. We need to transform that situation and the ultimate way to do that is to move from a system that is too dependent on doctors in training to one which is consultant-provided. In essence there would be more consultants and a trade-off between the number of consultants and junior doctors that currently exists.Jointly with the North-Eastern Health Board, we appointed Mr. Kevin Bonner to carry out a full report on the issues around the Monaghan situation. I do not intend to intervene in the way the North-Eastern Health Board discharges its duty in terms of protocols for major accidents. It is common sense and a basic principle in terms of accidents, as Deputy Twomey alluded to earlier, that anyone involved in a serious accident should be stabilised at the nearest hospital. He or she can then be moved on to the correct centre where proper effective interventions can take place in terms of multidisciplinary teams of consultants on standby. That is established practice and that has happened for years without any hue and cry.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	88	It is interesting that when I announced the appointment of additional accident and emergency consultants three years ago everyone started roaring and shouting about accident and emergency consultants, but they had nothing before that and many hospitals had never even contemplated having them. As soon as we announced an increase in the number every area in the country wanted one.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	89	The Minister says he will not intervene or interfere but I argue that it is long past the time he did both.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I am sorry but the Deputy will have to find another forum to argue his case.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I wish to ask the Minister two quick questions, both of which are related to his commitment to increase the number of beds in the system. I presume he would regard the Coombe Hospital as a centre of excellence and one where, to quote him, it is safe to provide maternity services. What does he have to say to a young Dublin woman who went there recently to deliver her first baby who did not have a bed but was put in a wheelchair for seven and a half hours after giving birth? Would he regard this as being consistent with the commitment to have sufficient beds in the system? He talked about a commitment to provide beds but is there not an inconsistency in providing money last year for 265 additional beds only to have 250 of them closed yesterday? Is it an efficient use of resources to provide beds and then not fund them?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The Minister said he did not want to use the word "downgrade" but he spoke of the reconfiguration of services based on size rather than catchment area which gives rise to the issue of accessibility. He said he will not interfere in regard to the Royal College of Surgeons and the provision of supports because there will not be two consultants in some of the smaller hospitals to support accident and emergency services. In light of the fact that this year's budget is not based on last year's outturn and from the points made by the Minister it appears evident to many of the smaller hospitals that they are threatened with downgrading.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I am not aware of the individual case referred to by the Deputy in terms of the Coombe Hospital which has provided excellent services.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The service was excellent but the person would like to have had a bed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I will check on that individual case with the Coombe Hospital, now that it has been raised in the House. We are aware that maternity hospitals have been under considerable pressure in Dublin for a variety of reasons over recent years. The Coombe Hospital has always discharged its functions in an excellent manner and the quality of service provided by it and, indeed, the other maternity hospitals in Dublin has been quite exceptional in many instances.In terms of bed capacity, we must remember that the entire system is not ERHA-based. The 502 beds to which I referred are in operation. I can give specific information of where the various boards made proposals to us and we provided ring-fenced funding for this which was followed up this year in the budget. It is not true that 250 beds were closed yesterday.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	96	They were announced. Some of them were closed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	97	There was an announcement that it was intended to close 250 beds and, as I said in reply to an earlier question, meetings are under way to try to ascertain the full nature of that situation and to discuss the difficulties that have been flagged by the Dublin academic teaching hospitals.In terms of Deputy Naughten's question, the reconfiguration is not on the basis of the size of hospitals, it is on the basis of quality and health outcomes – what is best for the patient in terms of giving the right service and what particular hospitals can do best in their appropriate circumstances. It is also dictated by factors such as the consultant and junior doctor issue that I mentioned earlier. We are all aware that there is a European Union directive which is putting pressure on the Government to reduce the working week of junior doctors to 48 hours per week by 2009, which is in turn putting pressure on the system here. That is creating its own imperative for change and combined with the need to provide a more consultant-provided service is dictating the pace of the reforms that will emerge. The fundamental principles underlying the change relate to quality and patient safety.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The drugs payment scheme, DPS, replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and drugs refund scheme, DRS, in 1999. It was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced following amendment of the relevant section of the Health Act 1970. However, amendment of the Act was delayed and, following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's office in October 2000, regulations made under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act, fixing the threshold for the new scheme at €53.33, came into effect on 1 March 2001. As has been pointed out previously, given that claimants derived greater overall benefits under the new scheme, as reflected in the significant increase in spending, the issue of possible refunds was not addressed at the time.The DPS makes important improvements over the previous schemes. It is more user-friendly and significantly improves the cash flow for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines. The scheme also removes the anomaly where, for example, a person or family spending over €100, £80, in one month and nothing for the rest of the quarter was not entitled to a refund. Under the DPS families can budget for the cost of prescribed medicines as, regardless of the cost, they are only liable for a maximum €70 in any month; they do not have to pay first and then claim a refund; and there are no qualifying criteria for the DPS, unlike the DCSS which required a doctor's certificate for a long-term medical condition and health board approval.The financial benefits of the DPS are reflected in the significantly higher spending level relative to the earlier schemes. The total cost of the DRS and the DCSS was €94.84 million, £74.69 million in 1998 which was the last full year of operation. In contrast, the DPS cost €139.67 million, £110 million, in 2000, the first full year of operation; €177.76 million, £140 million, in 2001 and €192 million in 2002. The aggregate benefits of the new scheme are clearly significantly greater than the previous schemes. Following a review by my Department of the position in relation to this issue, it has been decided that a process should be put in place for assessing applications for refunds to people arising from the introduction of the DPS. Public notices will be placed in the national newspapers inviting applications for refunds as soon as the detailed arrangements are finalised.The final cost and the numbers qualifying for reimbursement will not be known until all applications are received and processed.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	102	This is absolutely outrageous. There is mishandling and contradictory statements are being made. How many times has the Minister changed his mind about whether he should give a refund? In the past three months I have received different answers on each occasion I raised this question. He is giving a refund, he is not giving one, his advice is this, his advice is that. This is apart from the monumental mistake that the Department or the Minister made in the first instance. The reality is that this money was due to people in 2001, a year when the money was available, and now the Minister is coming back in 2003, when there is no money, with a final decision that maybe we should refund these people. Of course, the Minister should refund these people but how dare he put an advertisement in the papers asking them to apply for a refund. These people applied for a refund in 2001. Why is the money not being given to them now? Is it because the Minister does not have the records to establish to whom the money is owed?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	103	First, as I pointed out, on the basis of our assessment, most people benefited enormously from the new scheme. I have demonstrated that in terms of the increased expenditure under the scheme. In recent months, Department officials have been before Oireachtas committees and have indicated that we were looking at the logistics of ascertaining who was entitled to funding. The most effective way would be as I have just suggested. The amounts involved are very small, varying from €10 to €200. That is reflected in the degree of correspondence we have received on the issue. There are not thousands of people writing to the Department about this. Nonetheless, there is an issue to be addressed and we will devise a methodology to address it.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	104	On the increase in cost which the Minister has outlined, while I appreciate that data in his Department seems to be rather defective if this is any indication, does he accept that his own policy on the cardiovascular strategy and the treatment of diabetes, for example, is leading to increased cost of drugs? Does he agree that the increase in drug costs is at least partly a result of decisions he has made or policies he has promoted on the treatment of such conditions? As a result of the cardiovascular strategy, is it not inevitable that more expensive drugs, targeting cardiac patients, would be availed of through this scheme?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Yes, in short, the cardiovascular strategy has led to a very significant increase in prescribing statins. That is a good development and I have no problem with it. Our recent evaluation on the GMS and DPS illustrates a success story in many ways. Unfortunately, there can be negative coverage on this, in the sense that people see it as health expenditure on the drugs side. On the positive side, it means better treatment of patients with cardiovascular difficulties. It represents more effective treatment, as defined by chemical trials and so on. The value of statins is quite significant in terms of improved outcomes for people with cardiovascular difficulties.For the information of the House, another major area of improvement relates to peptic ulcers, which has involved a phenomenal increase in the cost of drugs, again reflecting more sophisticated treatments and the development of drugs which are having a better impact for the benefit of patients. However, the real cost driver in the DPS resulted from the fundamental change made in 1999. The old systems, DSS, DRS and DCS, were based on the principle of a person applying to a health board to claim back the money involved. It seems many people omitted to make such claims. Since we changed, in 1999, to a system of applying a threshold, initially €50 odd and now €70, the numbers have rocketed. Everyone concerned is entitled to avail of the DPS. Pharmacists now have control of the organisation of the DPS, whereas health boards formerly had and they have been very co-operative in ensuring the smooth running of the scheme. There has been a significant increase in numbers.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	106	That should have been foreseen. We were told there would be no increase in cost.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	107	That is in line with good patient care. We are now allowing people access to the schemes. Previously, they had to go through various bureaucratic obstacles.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	108	What is the point of requiring them to apply for refunds?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	109	There are huge logistical considerations involved.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I know there are. However, the Minister indicated that the chemists already have the required information.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	111	No. What I am saying—
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The Minister is trying to reduce the number of applicants.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	113	No. Under the new scheme, the system changed dramatically from the pre 1999 situation whereby one had to apply to the health board for a refund of expenditure on medicine.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The mistake was made then.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	115	The Deputy and I are referring to two different things. The change in 1999, moving to the DPS, was that the administration of the scheme was changed from health boards to pharmacists. As a result, the numbers availing of the DPS increased dramatically.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	116	In relation to the point made by Deputy McManus with regard to the effectiveness of various strategies and the inevitably greater dependence on drugs in keeping people out of hospitals, thereby saving money, the Brennan report suggested that people using new and better drugs should be penalised by having to pay for them, with the exception of generic drugs. How does that fit with the fact that it may save the health service money?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	117	No. Generic drugs are not lesser drugs. They have the same active ingredients but are less expensive than the branded products. We have been actively pursuing with the pharmacological unit which is funded by my Department in St. James's Hospital, ways of introducing generic drugs in the GMS. There should be legislative provision that the State should only refund the equivalent of the cost of generic drugs. Generic drugs which become available on the market are not of lesser quality and there is no adverse impact on patient care or health outcomes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Discussions are taking place between Belfast City Hospital and the North-Western Health Board regarding the provision of cancer services, including radiotherapy, for Donegal patients. I am advised that the current radiotherapy capacity in Northern Ireland does not allow for any additional patients from this jurisdiction to be treated there. I am also advised that oncology treatment services, including radiotherapy services, are being transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a multi-disciplinary tertiary referral university hospital. This centralised service will provide all radiation oncology services in Northern Ireland. Extensive new radiotherapy treatment facilities are being constructed on the hospital campus at present and it is expected these new facilities will come on stream in 2006 – 2007. When these new facilities come on stream, it is hoped that some Donegal patients will then be treated in Belfast City Hospital.The North-Western Health Board has a long association of working closely with Belfast City Hospital in providing cancer care. This has significantly enhanced the quality of cancer care delivered in Donegal and has been a key factor in attracting high quality specialist staff to Letterkenny General Hospital.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I welcome the information, even if it relates to the future, that we will have co-operation with the North and that people in the north west will be in a position to avail of radiotherapy services there. I note that the Minister gave the go-ahead yesterday for the recruitment of staff for the radiotherapy service in Galway. Does he envisage that the staff will be recruited this year and, if so, out of what budgets will they be paid?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	120	That is a separate question.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	121	It is related to radiotherapy services in the west.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	122	The sanction involves the cost for the remainder of this year and the full year cost. The cost for this year will be low, having regard to the recruitment process. The sanction also allows for the full year cost.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Is the Minister aware that less than one-third of 12,000 patients in this State who require radiotherapy each year are currently receiving that service? It is essential, as I am sure the Minister agrees, that we develop cross-Border provision of services in all areas of health care. Will the Minister explain the reason his focus, in terms of access to Belfast, is solely in relation to Donegal? Others living in the Border periphery would find Belfast more accessible than the assumed centres that will be acknowledged in the report of the radiotherapy service development group, soon to be published. Will the Minister confirm that the centres to be confirmed in that report are Dublin, Cork and Galway, leaving out whole swathes of even this jurisdiction, in terms of access to radiotherapy service? If we are looking at this issue on an all-Ireland and all-island basis, it is not only a cross-Border matter. When we refer to an all-island context, we refer to all parts of the island. Dublin, Cork and Galway will not cater to two-thirds of the island terrain. We need the extension of this service to a number of other centres, including the case which has been made for Waterford and for areas north of a line from Dublin to Galway. What are we to do in the Border regions, including the north-west area, other than taking the Minister's point about Donegal having access to Belfast in the future? Whole swathes of the country will be without this essential service, so what does the Minister intend to do?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	124	It is interesting that in Northern Ireland they are talking about just one radiotherapy centre for the entire Six Counties, yet the Deputy is suggesting that we should have six in the South.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	126	He went around it and did not tell me which ones should be in or out because that would hamper the recruitment drive which the Deputy's party is engaged in across the country, on the back of the health service.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Would the Minister not agree that we certainly need more?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The all-island approach is correct and we are examining this matter in that context. When the Northern Ireland Executive was up and running, I had very good consultations with my opposite number, Ms Bairbre de Brún, and both our Departments continue to do that. As regards developing North-South collaboration and shared services, it makes far greater sense to do so. We can be of assistance to the North, and vice versa, with regard to certain tertiary services which involve a significant patient throughput. For example, heart and lung transplants provide the potential for an all-island service and we have provided funding to the Mater Hospital in this regard. The North-Western Health Board has already engaged with Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry by sharing consultant appointments for the provision of breast cancer services. That is a good example of cross-Border co-operation.The principle emanating from the report on radiotherapy facilities by Mr. Donal Hollywood is that one must have a sufficient population catchment area and a sufficient throughput of patients to justify, guarantee and attract high quality, multi-disciplinary teams to provide the kind of services we require. The original cancer strategy in 1996 suggested the provision of radiotherapy facilities only in Cork, Dublin and possibly Galway. My predecessor moved on Galway early in 1997, so they are the three major centres that are currently being progressed. More than €25 million has been invested in St. Luke's Hospital and a further €9 million was invested in Cork University Hospital. There has also been a multi-million euro investment in Galway as part of the wider development of the city's University College Hospital. We have now sanctioned revenue funding for the recruitment of staff for the Galway radiotherapy centre.Clearly, the services are not at the level they should be and I accept the Deputy's original point that we need greater radiotherapy capacity to cover the number of cancer patients that are presenting for treatment.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Within the next six to eight weeks.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The report on Surgical Procedures for Selected Cancers in Ireland, referred to by the Deputy, was prepared as part of the work which the National Cancer Forum is currently undertaking in the development of a new national cancer strategy. The report examined oncology surgery between 1997 and 2002 in respect of a number of site-specific cancers, including lung, breast, pancreas and colon.The forum has advised me that international experience in oncology surgery, especially in relation to complex procedures, is that it should be limited to those hospitals that have adequate case volume and the appropriate skill mix and support services in the various modalities of care. In this context, the forum is of the view that the arrangements for the delivery of cancer services reflected in the data outlined in the report are not generally in accordance with best practice. There is insufficient case volume presented in the data to support the number of consultants and hospitals engaged in oncology surgery.In terms of the delivery and future development of cancer services, these arrangements cannot be recommended by the forum nationally. The forum will reflect further on this issue as it prepares the next national cancer strategy.I consider that a broad-based response to the report is required, involving the health authorities, health boards, professional bodies and the forum. In that regard, my Department's chief medical officer has referred the report to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The chief medical officer has advised that the pattern of activity in the report raises a number of issues relating to the practice of surgery and the arrangements for the training of surgeons in the relevant sub-specialties. He has asked the college to offer its advice as to actions the Department, the college and health agencies might need to take in response to the report.In addition, my Department has referred the report to the chief executive officers of the health authorities and health boards, and has advised them of the specific views expressed by the National Cancer Forum. My Department has asked the chief executive officers to examine the organisation and delivery of oncology surgery at regional level in light of the forum's advice. Discussions will also take place between the chief executive officers and my Department's management advisory committee. My Department has also referred the report to Comhairle na nOspidéal for appropriate attention.In addition, I have asked the forum to consider the processes and structures at national, professional or hospital levels that best ensure that we not only deliver a service that is in line with best practice but that we can validate progress in that regard. I acknowledge this important work of the forum and look forward to receiving the new national cancer strategy report later this year.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I thank the Minister for his reply. Would he not accept, however, that it is disturbing for patients to read that such a high level of complex surgical procedures are being carried out by general surgeons who do not have the experience or competence required to meet best practice standards? The Minister should go beyond consulting and set out a direction for the practice in hospitals across the country. Is the Minister not concerned, for example, that as he has employed more consultants, the percentage of consultants who fall into the category of doing less than ten procedures a year – which means that they do not have the necessary experience – has actually risen from 40% to 55%? The Minister may claim that he is providing more consultants but standards are falling as a result of these appointments. Surely the Minister has a responsibility to set out certain guidelines to ensure the required standards for cancer patients, whose outcome is dependent upon the experience and skill of the surgeon. Such patients should feel secure that specialists have a certain level of experience in complex cancer surgery.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I do not have any broad disagreement with a number of the issues raised by the Deputy. There is a strong onus, responsibility and obligation on the professional community to reflect on the data that has now been presented. Members of my Department's medical division, who are also members of the National Cancer Forum, were involved in ascertaining this data. We are not just referring these reports on, we are engaging with the health board chief executive officers, hospital managers and the Royal College of Surgeons to bring about change.A number of consultants, particularly in the breast cancer area, were appointed in the 2001-2002 period. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that improvements will occur in that speciality in the next year or two as the new appointments come on stream.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	134	What is the message, do not get bowel cancer?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	135	No. It is important to bear in mind that when the national cancer strategy was published in 1996 it set certain targets, the main one being survival rates. Following an evaluation of that strategy, the preliminary indicators are that we will have exceeded the objective of reducing mortality from cancer. The strategy and the investment we have made are having an impact on outcomes for cancer patients. I hope we will get to the day when cancer, like many other conditions, can be managed and treated as an ongoing illness.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I will point out how the strategy might work. In the south-east, general surgeons sub-specialise in cancers in various small hospitals. They take patients from other regions into their hospitals and look after them. Oesophageal cancers are treated in Wexford, pancreatic cancers in Clonmel, and breast cancers in Waterford. This is a useful way of maintaining smaller hospitals as well as keeping up the level of expertise of general surgeons in certain sub-specialities. By their very nature, general surgeons are in smaller regional hospitals, not in the larger centres. When the next cancer strategy is being drawn up we must take into account that such services are being provided efficiently and capably by certain general surgeons. I support what has been said about a small number of procedures being carried out; they should not be because it is dangerous.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I would not necessarily endorse that. Oesophageal cancers require a specialised response, both in my opinion and that of the National Cancer Forum. I am concerned that more than three-quarters of consultants carried out less than ten procedures in that area alone. I do not think that represents a sufficient case-load to build up the requisite expertise over time. There are some very high-quality people in the country, who are highly regarded internationally in terms of published research on oesophageal cancer. My inclination would be to try to move patients in the direction of the specialists in the specific fields.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Each day, during which the crisis in the health system is upon us, some 38 people do not receive vital and necessary procedures. This means that 38 families – parents, children and grandparents – will be denied the right to such procedures. By the time we reach 17 May, the first anniversary of the day the Government bought its way back to power, nearly 400 people will have been denied access to medical treatment. In a full year that will amount to almost 14,000 people.The Taoiseach promised before the last election to end waiting lists within two years. What contribution to the ending of waiting lists will be made by the closure of a further 250 beds? Does the Taoiseach have confidence in the Minister for Health and Children's ability to deliver the effective world-class health service that was promised by the Government? I do not doubt that the Taoiseach's reply will include telephone numbers, such as the sum of €9 billion that is being spent on the health services. Will he deal with the human cost of cutbacks, however, as distinct from the economists' version which does not treat people as people, but as statistics? The Minister, Deputy Martin, seems to be keen to leave the Department of Health and Children without having to make a difficult decision. He blames everybody and anybody other than himself and his Government colleagues.Increased charges have been levied across the country in relation to VHI costs and visits to accident and emergency departments. Is the Taoiseach happy that there is sufficient money in the system to deliver the service to which the Government committed itself two years ago? Is he confident that the person who is sitting beside him, the Minister for Health and Children, is capable of delivering the world-class service to which the Government committed itself, but in respect of which people are being denied vital procedures?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I will not give a litany of figures if Deputy Kenny does not wish me to do so. I share the view of everybody else who would like to see a world class health service in which people can be treated and patients can be looked after. The Government's objective continues to be to provide an efficient and top-class in-patient and out-patient service to all who require it. The Minister for Health and Children is doing his best and he has my confidence in that regard. While there are difficulties within the system, we should not forget that thousands of additional patients are being treated as in-patients and out-patients every year. The figures have increased substantially in recent years, but I will not recite them all again.There are problems in some areas of the health service, particularly in the Dublin hospitals where 81 beds have been closed. There are fears that other beds will have to be closed if issues relating to the 2001 and 2002 budgets are not sorted out. As the Minister, Deputy Martin, said during Question Time, meetings between the ERHA and the Department of Health and Children are taking place today. There will be further meetings between the authority, the Department and the Dublin academic teaching hospitals after the weekend. It is hoped that they can resolve some of the issues, which arise from the fact that the hospitals overspent in 2001 and 2002. Under the 1996 legislation, the additional moneys that were spent are subtracted from the hospitals' funds for this year. This creates cash-flow and financial difficulties for the hospitals. Such difficulties do not exist in many other aspects of the health service. In conjunction with the ERHA, which is directly responsible and accountable in this area, the Minister is endeavouring to deal with the problems.While I do not want to direct a barrage of figures at Deputy Kenny, it is only fair that I should point out that almost 400,000 in-patient and day cases are being treated in the ERHA area. This figure is much higher than the relevant figure some years ago. It is clear that if more resources were available, we would open more than the 709 beds that were opened this year. The Minister has kept to his commitment in that regard and has published the health strategy. The Cabinet is in the final weeks of dealing with the implementation of the strategy. Members of the Government have to grapple with difficult and complex areas and to come to a successful conclusion shortly. The position will not change overnight, but the Government's efforts will improve it into the future. The Minister is determined to deal with both of these separate issues, with my support and the support of the entire Cabinet.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The Taoiseach has said that the Minister for Health and Children is doing his best. If that is true, how can the increase of 87% in patient waiting lists at Beaumont Hospital since 1997 be explained? There has been an increase of 23% in the Mater Hospital and 108% in St. Vincent's University Hospital. How can these figures be explained? Are the Minister's best efforts good enough in this regard? How can one say to the six in ten adults who have been waiting for ENT surgery for more than a year that the hospitals over-spent last year? Would such an explanation suffice for the seven out of ten young children who have been waiting for more than six months for similar operations? How can one tell the 50% of young children who have been waiting for more than six months for vital cardiac surgery that they cannot and will not be treated until next year because the hospitals over-spent last year? How can one say to such people that the Minister is doing his best?The Taoiseach, who is in charge of the Government, said last year that waiting lists would be eliminated within two years. About 29,000 people are on waiting lists at present, a figure that will rise. The impact of the closure of a further 250 beds will exacerbate the problem. As a Dubliner, the Taoiseach is aware that even Ken Doherty could not come from that far behind.

We have put in a substantial amount of resources this year. It is not just about resources, as it is also about how we manage this for the future and how we deal with the difficulties that exist. That is what the Government is committed to do. One should not ignore the fact that tens of thousands of people are receiving quality services. There are ongoing difficulties in accident and emergency services. Many more people are being seen and helped throughout the range of in-patient and out-patient services and day care services. We have to try to build on the fact that the vast and overwhelming majority of patients are cured. That is what we are endeavouring to do in the health strategy, which has already been published. Within the strategy, we are trying to deal with the three reports which are before the Government, two of which have been completed and one of which has almost been completed. That is what we will do.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	170	How can the Taoiseach, as leader of this Government, say that there are more beds in the system than ever before? Was it not the man beside him, Deputy Martin, who published the document with such brouhaha and said that 3,000 additional beds were required? Was that not in the health strategy which is now in tatters like the reputation of the Minister? Is that not the reality?What is the point of the Taoiseach stating to the House that there are more beds in the system? Does he pay any attention to the statement by the chief executives, one from the Mater Hospital in the Taoiseach's constituency, and consultants? They pointed out the implications of the closures announced this week which are equivalent to closing one acute hospital in Dublin. Some 14,000 treatments are delayed while people in the community are in pain waiting for access to a hospital bed.Deputy Kenny reminded the Taoiseach of the anniversary of 17 May. Does the Taoiseach remember where he was one year ago yesterday? It goes without saying that he was not in the House, as he seldom is. The Taoiseach was in the lavish headquarters of the Fianna Fáil press office for the purposes of controlling the election where he announced, with the dauphin who sits beside him today, the document that committed to eliminating waiting lists within two years. Does he remember the promise to eliminate waiting lists within two years? The Taoiseach has failed to publish the figures for last December. When he said that he would cause waiting lists to be eliminated, did he simply mean that he would not publish the figures?This is beyond a laughing matter. If the current Minister cannot do the job, the Taoiseach should try to find someone who can as he had to do in the area of transport. For five years, the Government had a Minister responsible for transport who could not make a decision and that is why we are in the current mess. Is the Taoiseach going to do the same with people's lives? These people, some with life-threatening illnesses, are not statistics; they are awaiting care. While they cannot get access to a hospital bed, the Taoiseach stands up in the House to say that there are more beds than ever in the system. What world are we living in? This is a real crisis for real people who need real doctors to attend to them.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Deputy Rabbitte probably does not want to hear that he was not in the House this time last year either as we were in the middle of a general election campaign. He did not have to be glib about that.I said that while 81 beds were closed, 522 additional beds have been put into the system. Unless I have failed to count correctly, there are more beds in the system. I am merely giving a factual statistic, as I did with regard to waiting lists being down by 22%. I am simply providing a record of the figures.I am not saying there are not people to be cared for or current difficulties in some hospitals, particularly the academic teaching hospitals which are spending almost €900 million – I think €872 million is the correct figure – and treating in excess of 380 in-patients and day cases, an increase on previous figures. However, neither Deputy Rabbitte nor anyone else should, when there is a substantially increased number of patients and beds compared to last year, create the perception that the service is worse than it was.I am not endeavouring to give the perception that there are not people on waiting lists or that we do not need to do more in terms of numbers and resources to improve the position. That is the factual position and we should deal with it. That is why I stated that a lot of time was spent over the Easter break moving to the next stage of the health strategy, building on what was published in autumn 2001 and considering the reports to see what more can be done to better manage the funding of almost €10 billion, an enormous increase which Deputy Kenny acknowledged, which has been put into the system.I acknowledge there are difficulties in the four hospitals because they went over their allocations and the service plans agreed with the ERHA in 2001 and 2002. As a result of the 1996 legislation on accountability, that is taken from their allocation in 2003.

I have met and spoken with many of those concerned over the Easter break and I know of the difficulty. The Minister has been engaged in discussions with the hospitals and the ERHA is currently meeting with officials of the Department of Health and Children. The Dublin academic teaching hospitals, the ERHA and the Department of Health and Children are sitting down to see how they can deal with this situation.However, let us not say a situation is being created where less people are being seen in hospitals. There is a problem as long as anybody is on a waiting list although I do not think I will ever reach the day where nobody is on a waiting list. Nonetheless, we should try to reduce waiting lists as much as possible, maximise the resources available and try to achieve the maximum throughput for those resources. That is what we are trying to do.

The Taoiseach now says that we will never get to the day when there will not be a waiting list. At the top of the treasury management building one year ago, there was no waiting list at all. How can the Taoiseach say that this applies only to the Dublin teaching hospitals? That is not the case. What about the James Connolly Memorial Hospital or the children's hospital in Crumlin where one of the wards is being closed?

Yet the Taoiseach comes to the House to say that there are more beds than ever in the system. How are those caring for relatives on waiting lists for God knows how long supposed to react to such a statement from the head of Government?This is not an abstract question. We are talking about real people. A head consultant said last night that 14,000 treatments are delayed. It was the Taoiseach who published the health strategy, who rubbished everyone else's health policies this time last year, who said that Fianna Fáil had the money and the know-how, who appointed Deputy Martin as Minister, who is making a mess of things and who is the head of this Government.

Deputy Rabbitte is correct that there were many difficulties in the 1980s, some caused by my party and some by the hospital closure programme brought in by the Deputy's present party.

Under these terms the Irish people were to buy back their own natural resource from a major multinational company without a penny in royalties, with all costs to the company going back decades being written off against taxes and with no independent assessment by this State of the extent of the deposits independent of the companies which stand to gain massively from their exploitation. It is crucial that there is now new thinking as to how this natural resource is used for the benefit of all our people. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, would be better off trying to bring creative thinking to bear on this situation rather than acting as an unofficial PR man for Royal Dutch Shell. Will the Taoiseach look to the past, where the development of crucial natural and national resources – electricity generation, peat harvesting and sugar production – were thrust forward by dedicated State companies? Is it not clear that we now need a State exploration recovery agency for natural gas particularly to benefit our people so that funding can go to the health service and other badly needed areas and not bloat further multinational corporations?An ndéanfaidh an Taoiseach an rud ceart anois do mhuintir Iorrais, do mhuintir Mhuigheo agus do mhuintir na tíre uilig?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	198	There are two aspects to the Deputy's question. I remind Deputy Higgins that at the time the tax incentives and the various initiatives were introduced in the late 1980s or the early 1990s, there was no exploration whatsoever going on in this area. With regard to the one in which I was involved with the then Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, there was almost no activity in any of the Irish natural resources. Unfortunately, within our own corporate sector there is neither the resources nor the willingness on the part of people to undertake the level of expenditure that would be required. It is not that they have no interest but the required level of expenditure in the testing and various exploration programmes simply does not exist. I recall examining the various submissions at the time and the fact that the expenditure was not available. It is idealistic and Nationalistic to say it is a pity that these projects are not picked up by Irish people but that is not often possible. That is a question which relates also to this particular company in the Corrib field where somebody can come in, put in a vast amount of resources – somewhere of the order of €150 million – employ a lot of people and then nothing happens, which affects other initiatives.On the second part of the Deputy's question, I fully respect the decision of An Bord Pleanála, as I always do. It is to be hoped that the ruling does not end efforts to tap into the vein of energy off our coast because there are the knock-on issues of jobs and investment in infrastructure which has the potential to deliver. An Bord Pleanála's decision in relation to post-construction of the terminal at Bellanaboy for the development of the Corrib gas field has implications for the process of that development. That has to be examined now to determine if that project and the related developments are to be dropped. The company now has to decide whether it will apply for new planning permission to see what progress it can make and if anything else will happen. It defers also the future of gas supplies to the towns and the communities in the north-west which are hoping to get this opportunity. Substantial additional costs have been incurred by the developer as a consequence of the delay in the planning process which have been borne up-front in terms of the development of the Mayo-Galway export pipe line. Those costs are unlikely to be recovered by way of full projects but the company has to make an assessment to determine where it goes now but the Deputy will appreciate that there are no other companies waiting around to pick up this project. Unfortunately, that is not the way exploration works. There are no Irish companies willing to put in several hundred million euro on exploration, with all the risks involved. I wish that was the position, but it is not.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	199	In the early 1990s, the oil and gas companies knew the potential which existed off our shores. Does the Taoiseach not accept that it was a massive problem that this State had no independent assessment of those resources and put itself completely in the lap of the multinational corporations? One of the Taoiseach's handlers told a newspaper this weekend that the Taoiseach would be keeping more aloof and would be more presidential in this new Dáil term. For myself, one President in this State is more than enough but speaking of staying aloof, Fianna Fáil did not stay aloof from these companies which were its regular guests in its tent at the Galway races. Politically, the Taoiseach's party has been very close to these corporations and there are inexplicable questions as to why they were given these terms. Rather than being presidential, the Taoiseach should answer questions in a straight manner for the next eight weeks. That would be a real contribution to the Irish people.I asked the Taoiseach about the possible role for the State in the development of these natural resources. Is the Taoiseach aware that there are many Irish workers who have returned here from abroad with a lot of expertise in exploration, and others still working abroad who would like to come home if their energies and expertise were harnessed by the State?Does the Taoiseach accept the principle that our country's wealth should be for the benefit of all the people, not faceless shareholders in glass towers in New York, Tokyo, London or elsewhere? If the Government was guided by that principle, we would strike out and create new methods, including bringing the State to bear on the development and recovery of these resources as happened with crucial national industries of the past.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I wish I did not have to say this but a number of the Irish companies and their shareholders which tried to get involved in our natural resources got fairly well burned. There are many examples of those companies. Many others which are still in the business of our natural resources have had to vastly supplement their losses with profits from other businesses in which they are involved to try to keep them afloat. That is the reality. Unfortunately, there are no companies in this area within the Irish system. There may be some individual staff who come home and take up employment but they are not coming home with the investments to take up projects like the Corrib gas project or any of the others. I am sure the Deputy knows that in most of these projects, the investment necessary to do the exploration, the drilling and testing over many summers involves enormous sums of money. The risk for companies doing this and the amount of testing they have to do are enormous. There is no potential within the Irish system for people to invest several million euro in such projects. The tax benefits there, as good as they are, have not stimulated much activity for Irish people or others. Only a few people are interested in the Irish market. That is the way it goes and I must respect the decision of An Bord Pleanála. Unfortunately, however, there will be fewer investors after a decision like last week's because there are other places to go.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.The primary role of the cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and PPPs is supporting a Cabinet committee in its key task of providing a strong central guide and focus for the delivery of key national infrastructure, especially under the NDP. The team usually meets once a month, with the most recent meeting taking place on 16 April. That meeting was mainly focused on the key contexts that will set the agenda for the mid-term review of the NDP – namely, issues around priorities and finance, as well as legal considerations. The work of the Cabinet committee and the team is supported by an NDP communications strategy group, involving key delivery Departments and agencies.Among the key achievements and activities of the group are the establishment of an NDP-CSF information unit under the Department of Finance to lead an information campaign; the dissemination of information on NDP investment, as required under an EU regulation, through such mechanisms as regional information campaigns, a dedicated website, the NDP annual report and the In Progress newsletter launched recently; the development of newspaper supplements and advertorials in the main national dailies; and the commissioning by the NDP-CSF information office of public awareness research which indicated that the general public want to know more about the NDP and, in particular, what is happening in their local areas.The communications strategy group will continue with its work over the remaining life of the NDP.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Given that the national development plan is well behind schedule and over budget, what changes has the committee made to bring costs under control? Why does it cost 12 times more to dig a hole in Dublin than in America and six times more than in Spain? The Minister for Transport has announced massive programmes in recent months but he has been told by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, not to submit any more because there is no money for them. What are they at in this regard? Why has there been an overspend on roads in the east while the BMW roads programme falls way behind? Has the committee examined this issue? What changes, if any, has it made to bring inflation under control in this area so that the NDP can get back on track?Public private partnerships seem to be in serious difficulty. The development of the Cork school of music, on which €11 million has been spent by architects to date, is at a halt. The project and five others involving schools that were to be built under the PPP scheme have been held up on the basis of a spurious claim by Brussels that this would interfere with the general level of Government spend. Was this matter discussed by the strategy group? Can we have an assurance that the PPP scheme will proceed? 2005 is the European year of culture. We have failed to provide adequate funding in this, the European Year of People with Disabilities. Cork will be without its school of music unless this matter is resolved. It also means that schools buildings projects, which are being lined up for inclusion under this scheme, are also stalled.Was that element of the NDP discussed by the strategy group? Has it made recommendations? What is the problem with PPPs? Why has the spurious difficulty with Brussels not been sorted out? Will Cork have its school of music by 2005?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	210	This group of questions does not deal with the Cork school of music or schools building projects. The five schools to which the Deputy referred have been built. The Cork school of music has not been built because of an enormous increase in costs. The argument over the PPPs, affects not just that, but other projects. In the EUROSTAT figures on the PPPs they take in the project on year one. That is not a sensible position and it is being debated by the Department of Finance and others. However, I cannot see why the figures are not spread out over a number of years. This relates to all projects and not only the Cork School of Music and schools building projects. That is the way EUROSTAT does it and that issue is being debated elsewhere.Roads projects come under the committee. A total of 26 projects, involving 150 kilometres, have been completed, while 13 projects are due to be opened this year. Substantial planning and design work has been carried out on many other projects. The Deputy will be aware of the projects that are proceeding. An additional €209 million is being provided for the national roads programme, giving an overall budget of almost €1.3 billion.A total of €300 million more than had been envisaged when the NDP was launched was invested over the first three years of the roads programme because value for money could not be achieved for a number of reasons. Construction price inflation reached 50% between the time the NDP was launched and the end of the third year of implementation. The roads evaluation report recently showed that outturn costs were an average of 38% in excess of tender prices. There was under-estimation initially because it was not possible to specify from the plans the land costs, project re-specification, which happened in many cases, and delays as a result of the foot and mouth disease outbreak and the IFA dispute.We are achieving more realistic tender prices now and better value for money than was the case. I am not sure what is the percentage but it is nothing like the percentages between 2000 and 2002 when many resources were eaten up. However, this year because there is better value in the programme, a greater amount will be spent than in any of those years. The additional €209 million allocated in the budget will allow a number of significant projects to go ahead.With regard to the PPP roads projects, the Minister had to come to the conclusion that the only way to finance them was to introduce toll charges. Each time a PPP road project is undertaken, there will be a toll on the road. The private sector is not interested otherwise. There has been examination of imaginative schemes for financing such projects and the National Development Finance Agency is making sure we get better value for money and examining the best financial mechanisms to achieve that. PPPs are useful for road projects, but overall, only one tenth of the investment in the roads programme comes from PPPs.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The Taoiseach has covered a range of issues. The first toll road opened in Britain last night – that road extends 27 miles around Birmingham – but the issue is one of choice. A person has the choice of driving on a toll road, which has three lanes either side. In many cases with toll roads in Ireland we do not have that choice but are forced to take the only route that exists.The Taoiseach did not deal with the seriously escalated costs of tunnel digging here as against in America and Spain, which the Minister for Transport visited. In his reply will the Taoiseach inform us whether he has sorted out the business of the Luas crossing the most major intersection in the country at the Red Cow? It appears to be completely insane to do something like that.The issue of the major infrastructural project in north Mayo was turned down by An Bord Pleanála last week. If it is not a gas terminal this week it may be a wind farm next week, an ESB line the following week, an incinerator the week after or some other major business. Every week one of these issues arises. Does the Taoiseach think consideration should be given to a situation where the Planning Appeals Board should present all the facts to the Cabinet and the Cabinet should take responsibility for major infrastructural decisions where there is national economic significance and the greater common good is at stake, taking into account people's legitimate concerns and interests? It appears as if hundreds of millions will be squandered over the next 20 years on debating issues as distinct from providing facilities for the overall development of the kind of country to which we all aspire.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	212	On the road structure, I suggest the Deputy put down a question to the Minister. That is a long saga. I have listened to debate on it but I am not briefed enough to explain the design. It is a major issue and there has been much discussion on it.The Deputy asked why the costs of tunnelling are different here. We are looking closely at that and sent some key officials to examine the matter because the estimate cost we got on the metro was €4.8 billion while a longer stretch in Barcelona in Spain cost under €1 billion, 22% of the cost. The issue is not simple but the officials have analysed the costs here. They have looked at all the issues from construction to the pipes, digging, tunnelling and boring. They are examining them together with the consultants' costs. There are many issues so there is not one answer.Much of the issue is linked to the Deputy's second question. Environmental impact studies in Spain are different. The Spanish do not worry too much about them once they concern what is beneath the ground. I am not saying they do not take due care, that would be totally wrong, but they do not go through the long process.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	222	On a more serious note, during construction in Spain and in other cities, boring takes place for 24 hours a day but here it lasts seven hours. Their procedure on coming to a conclusion on the planning process is entirely different. If it is a major infrastructural project any delay is referred to the person who makes the decision and the decision is made within 24 hours by one person.This leads to the question of major projects. Let me preface this by saying that I think reasonable concerns, made by reasonable people, that influence projects should always be taken into account, but this is difficult. I am regularly faced with the position – I know that people in the future will be faced with the same position and maybe people faced it in the past but not to the same extent – where I have to explain the situation to somebody who has invested a lot in a project – in this case it was €150 million – and who has gone through a process that led from one stage to another, their work is useless and they must start again. It has not just happened in this case but in many others. It increasingly happens and it is difficult for people to understand why there is not a different system.I know where the present system came from and I can understand it. Perhaps it was not a good idea that a politician made the final decision, not because a politician ever did anything wrong in this regard because a judgment has to be made. A politician might have some expertise in this area if he or she was perhaps an engineer but then again if he or she is a teacher or a farmer he or she may not have the knowledge. I would not put myself forward as having the technical knowledge. I would have to base my knowledge on judgment but I think our present position is unreasonable. It is unreasonable that people should go through several years on a project and then have to come back to the start and consider whether they should continue at all. It is unreasonable, particularly when there are not many of these people or companies around. I share Deputy Kenny's concern. We need to look at the issue.I do not have a quick answer as to the best way to do this but some Ministers and the Attorney General are looking at aspects of the issue. Our rules are different from those of other countries. I do not say we should throw safety to the wind because I am sure if Prime Minister Aznar was here he would take offence if I said they do anything other than with the greatest safety. I am sure they take all that into account. It seems as if our system, all the way along through the local authority, the planning process, the judicial review, the High Court, the Supreme Court and, when that goes wrong, back to the start again, is not the way to proceed. I do not have a ready-made answer to the question but our process creates difficulty and thwarts investment.It is creating difficulty in the international community because there is usually another place to go, particularly in terms of the next 20 years. I think Deputy Kenny would share that view. If we look at the capabilities of eastern Europe over the next 20 years there will be many places to go – for example, we have only to look at the wage rates. I looked at the costs recently in some of these areas in eastern Europe as against here and one can see where people will go. That issue has to be looked at because we must be able to give answers to these people.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Is the Taoiseach aware that the thinking he has just outlined is deeply worrying and undermining of the first consideration of public safety? Will the Taoiseach agree that in any project of public private partnership or otherwise, a mountain of potentially liquid peat is as much danger to the people of Mayo, whether the issue is passed by the Cabinet or by the normal processes that exist at present? It is reckless for him and Deputy Kenny to imply that we should cut corners and that anything underground, for example, should not be subject to environmental scrutiny. That is where our source of life, water, comes from. The people in Marino will tell him how important the matter is.Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a widespread public perception among taxpayers that the public private partnership process is a mechanism to enrich the big shareholders of private companies while the State will carry the can in many cases if there are problems and the taxpayer will pay? Will the Taoiseach agree that this perception is justified, particularly regarding the 13 tolled road projects under the national development plan that are the subject of public private partnership? Does the Taoiseach agree that public private partnership is a highly inefficient way of funding these projects from the point of view of taxpayers who pay for half or more of the initial cost, continue to pay tolls indefinitely and then have to pay not just the full cost of the project, but also the profit for the big shareholders, which need not be in the equation as far as major public projects are concerned?We have discussed the issue before and I hope the Taoiseach will have reflected on it in the meantime. Does he agree that replicating 13 times around the country the toll bridge in my constituency, which is an example of the most pervasive type of public private partnership in this State, namely, road structure projects, and is the greatest blockage to traffic in the Dublin area in which there are many blockages, and making taxpayers pay through the nose for others' profits in order that they can be held up for even longer is not the way to proceed?

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Deputy had an opportunity to speak.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	227	What we are talking about is why the cost structure of one project is 400 times greater than in another country. We were merely analysing what happens. It is not a question of short cuts as I made absolutely clear that safety standards have to be followed. However, the reality is that if major projects are brought through a process that seems overly bureaucratic, too long and too difficult, the people who invest in such projects go elsewhere and one loses out in terms of jobs, investments and the opening up of land for other opportunities. With large projects, land masses are opened up for further development in the future, which normally proves to be a good rather than a bad thing. This does not mean abandoning laws or safety requirements. Unfortunately, we have a reputation for objecting to almost everything and then losing some of these major investments. It is a feature of the process here and a fact of life.On Deputy Joe Higgins's point about PPPs, I made a number of these arguments previously. PPPs have a use which should not be over stated in the way some people would like. I disagree less with the Deputy on this point than on many others. Within the context of the comprehensive frameworks for public private partnerships negotiated by the Government and the social partners under the last partnership programme, an undertaking was given that in any new agreement the central PPP unit in the Department of Finance would develop public private partnerships in consultation with the social partners who represent the taxpayers affected by PPPs. It was also agreed that the unit would issue to State authorities detailed guidelines on all aspects of PPPs and how they work to ensure there would be transparency. These guidelines would provide a clear, consistent and coherent process for State authorities in developing projects under PPP arrangements. The Government will seek to minimise PPP bid costs by standardising contract forms, conditions and procedures at tender and construction stages and will issue guidelines to improve efficiency in the bid process.To answer Deputy Joe Higgins's question, there is not sufficient scope to open up every project to PPPs and this would not be desirable. I understand that just three of the 13 projects on the list to which he referred have a public private partnership element. I am sure he will accept that the difficulty with not going down the road of public private partnerships for projects is that it lengthens completion times. We are spending €1.3 billion this year, an enormous amount of resources.Our GDP spending on capital infrastructure projects is about twice the European average. We are trying to catch up by addressing our infrastructural deficits from the past. With the exception of Luxembourg, we spend much more than any other EU country. I do not see how any other country could spend substantially more than us in GDP terms over the next ten or 20 years. While it is lovely to talk about the possibility of removing the PPP element from the infrastructural programme, I do not believe we will be able to do so as it would mean large tracts of motorway standard road would not be built. If we did not proceed, the resources to fund the programme to catch up with other countries would not be available.If I recall the figure correctly, the projects required to be done will cost about €15 billion. The National Roads Authority is ready to commence many of them. We are spending some €1.3 billion this year, which is more than €200 million more than last year. If one were to remove the PPP element, one would be saying to the country that we will not have some of the key motorways in the BMW region and other regions for a long time. That would not be a good idea.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	228	On the same question and the contrast between the lag in the national development programme to which Deputy Kenny referred and the constant and outrageous escalation in building costs, where does the Taoiseach stand on the growth and stability pact? I almost choked on my cornflakes the other morning when I read a comment by the Tánaiste that Ireland is under-borrowed. I had to re-read it as I could not believe it given her position at the time of the election. She said we are under-borrowed and that the growth and stability pact would have to be revisited. Is this also the Taoiseach's view? Does he believe the time has come for such a step to be taken given the peculiar characteristics of our economy, to which he adverted, as compared to the other European Union member states?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I am a supporter of the growth and stability pact in so far as its principles apply to price stability and keeping low interest rates in EU economies. As regards the argument in favour of opening up the pact, which has been made by this country and, to various degrees, a number of other countries, I take a conservative view of how it this should be done. We have a borrowing rate of 34% of GDP – only Luxembourg's rate is lower – and an infrastructure deficit problem which did not arise in the current period. For the first time since the foundation of the State we have, in the past ten years or so, been able to amass resources to deal with our deficits, whether in terms of infrastructure or human capital.Other countries follow the figures and guidelines we follow, but for the past 40 years they – Austria for example – have been able to spend on infrastructure. My objection is that the system is too regimental and no leeway is given to countries which have infrastructural problems. Why do we spend double the European average on infrastructure? Maybe the reason is that other countries do not need to spend so much because they already have substantial infrastructure. I would not agree to allow countries to do what they liked with regard to the growth and stability pact, as I know where we would end up, particularly now that more countries are joining the EU. In such circumstances, it would be very hard to maintain price stability, which is one of the great benefits to our economy.However, where there are major, clearly defined infrastructural projects, for which one can prove a case in terms of economic benefit – countries should be required to do this – one should be allowed to go outside the terms of the pact. I think Deputy Rabbitte will accept my point that if a country with a low debt to GDP ratio, which is likely to remain almost unchanged for the next ten years or so – in our case it might increase a little over the next decade as we will return to deficits, but not significantly, except in the event of an unforeseen crisis along the way – is not allowed to spend money on capital projects, it will be inhibited from being able to grow its economy into the future. I do not understand that logic. The Deputy is saying we are all treated the same. I am of the view that there should be some leeway for fixed determined projects where one has to prove economic development. I do not share the view that it could be loosened up to a figure without having to prove a case. I argued this when I had the opportunity to meet the Commission. I also raised it recently with Commissioner Solbes whom I know from my days as Minister for Finance. I am trying to make that case.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I take it the Taoiseach does not agree with the Tánaiste that it should be let rip and that we are under-borrowed. As regards the serious points the Taoiseach made about the unique features of a country with an infrastructural deficit, compared to countries at the heart of Europe where that problem does not obtain, has he put forward any proposals about how exceptions might be made for specified capital projects in this jurisdiction? I do not know how one can say it is important to keep something like the growth and stability pact in place, perhaps even more important in terms of the accession countries while, at the same time, acknowledging that a country which has a good debt equity or debt:GNP ratio, as we have, should be permitted to borrow for certain essential capital projects which are constraining our economic progress into the future. How does one get that through a pact which is supposed to have application across the member states?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	231	That is the debate. The Deputy has reiterated my points. I do not think it is impossible to build in a mechanism where the Commissioner responsible, in this case Commissioner Solbes, would be able to allow through a project on a case by case basis, based on the debt:GDP ratio. It was stated recently in a Commission document on the trans-European network projects that leeway should be given on such projects. The Commission has already moved its position. We cannot use the trans-European project criterion and, therefore, are restricted. Some of the countries which undertake a major trans-European project would be allowed to take that position. The date is not too far away, although it has not been reached yet, where a country such as Ireland should be able to make a case, not willy-nilly but in relation to fixed projects.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I presume from the Taoiseach's comments that the officials from the Department of Finance have lost out. In the past he admitted that the Department of Finance was opposed to the public-private partnership process because it realised that it gave less value to the people. Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify whether there is concern about road tolls. An article was written recently about the proposal from Europe to adopt a common electronic tolling system so people would not have to queue at tolling booths. Unfortunately, that could not apply in Ireland because our toll system is designed for the road builder, not for traffic management purposes. Has that concern been raised with the Taoiseach? Has he heard other concerns about the PPP process?

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	243	Teachers in a school in Cork, which is operating under the new PPP system, cannot lift a piece of chalk without looking at the contract which was originally signed with the operator and a child cannot play football on the pitch if it is not included in the contract. Far from being less bureaucratic, the PPP system is proving to be a bureaucratic nightmare. This will benefit private sector businessmen, not the students, road users or waste management companies which must work in the areas in which the PPP system will apply.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	244	In any PPP project we have used – there have not been many – we sought to ensure we had the best technical expertise. As I stated earlier, the committee does not deal with PPPs in the school project area. I understood the five schools which were built under the PPP system were operating successfully. Perhaps they must comply with contracts, but I understood the system was working. I am not dealing with that issue.

Has it looked at the possibility of utilising the enormous funding that is available in the National Pension Reserve Fund, much of which has been sadly squandered on the stock exchanges of the world? Would it not be better to invest public moneys in infrastructural development to alleviate the choking effect on our economy and the halting of infrastructural development? Rather than paying incredible sums of money to private profiteers, would the Taoiseach agree that, if required, we could arrange for an index-linked repayment schedule to the national pensions reserve fund which would be a more appropriate means of using public funding rather than lining the pockets of those who see only an opportunity for themselves?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	246	The answer to the Deputy's question is "yes". Every mechanism and every form of finance, such as the capital programme and everything outside it, including the national pensions reserve fund, have been considered. The National Development Finance Agency is involved in ensuring that the best advice is given in whatever way to the State authorities in terms of the delivery of infrastructural projects, evaluating the financial risks involved and accessing the optimum funding mechanisms – be they the Exchequer, private sources, the European Investment Bank or the National Development Finance Agency.The Deputy homed in on the pension fund. There has been considerable involvement with the agency and the Minister for Finance. However, they would only be interested in big projects. They would not be interested in many smaller projects. What seemed like imaginative ways of financing most of them fell through and it came down to a few. We have gone through them all in the past year. It comes down in the end to capital projects. There are not many PPPs when one goes through them. There are some in the areas of water, waste, schools and road tolling. We get the best advice and value for what we do by using the National Development Finance Agency.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	255	What steps has the Government taken to ensure that future public private partnership projects are not occasions for the further inflation of costs by some private sector participants? I am reminded of the Taoiseach spitting fire against profiteering by middlemen, learned professionals and others at the IMI conference in Killarney. I thought he was quoting from Karl Marx's Manifesto for a moment. How does he propose to translate that sentiment into management of the PPP system? Taxpayers can be held to ransom by this process.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	256	As I said, the committee was not dealing with the Cork issue. I am not sure when EUROSTAT raised this matter but it was some considerable time ago.Regarding increases in construction costs, whether PPPs or not, there was an increase of almost 50% in construction price inflation from the time of the launch of the national development plan to the end of the third year of its implementation, as I said earlier. Most projects in the roads programme were not PPPs but road evaluation shows that the actual outturn costs were an average of 38% in excess of tender prices. That has moderated now because of the economic situation of the past two years but public private partnerships did not drive those costs; it was the private market alone, dealing with contracts given by local authorities through the NRA.

The proposal before us provides limited time for statements only. The Taoiseach must be aware, having dealt earlier with Taoiseach's questions, that all questions relevant to Northern Ireland and the peace process were withdrawn in anticipation of No. 18, statements on Northern Ireland. My questions have been withdrawn, as have those of other Members, yet there is no accommodation for questions to the Taoiseach or the Minister following statements. That is outrageous. We cannot now ask questions on these issues. All we have is a facilitation for limited time statements and questions are being dumped.I previously raised a similar matter with the Taoiseach who, in fairness, acknowledged that proceeding in such a manner was unjust and unfair to Members, but it is happening again. I appeal to the Taoiseach to intervene to ensure an increase in time to accommodate greater participation and to provide for questions to him or the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That is imperative given the seriousness of the issue before us. Failing a positive response from the Taoiseach, I will have no alternative but to oppose the Order of Business as I believe this is a wholly inadequate facilitation.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	297	We would not normally take statements on Northern Ireland but would debate EU matters following the summit, but in the circumstances, the House agreed we would have statements on Northern Ireland. Questions on Northern Ireland will be taken for three quarters of an hour next week.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Is the proposal agreed?

On 15 April in the House, I asked the Taoiseach if he would instruct the Minister for Agriculture and Food to intervene in the industrial dispute in his Department, which has severe ramifications for food safety.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	304	The Deputy's first question is in order. His second question is the subject of the Adjournment Debate tonight.

There is a severe difficulty with respect to food safety.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Early 2004.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	308	In the legislative programme published today the Taoiseach commits to the Redundancy Payments Bill. I recently had a meeting with the workers at Comerama in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. In TexTech, the Tánaiste committed to making the Bill retrospective and redundancy settlements were entered into on that basis. I ask the Taoiseach if the Tánaiste is persisting in the view that that is no longer possible although she entered into an agreement.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	309	We cannot discuss the contents of the legislation. When will the Bill come before the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	310	It was published today and it is not legally possible to have retrospection.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	311	If that is the case the Tánaiste should not go around the country making promises.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	312	We cannot have a debate on the Bill at this stage. I call Deputy Sargent.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I did not make promises. I said if I could, I would.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I ask the Tánaiste not to interrupt Deputy Sargent.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The Deputies are holding a constituency meeting.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	318	Constituency colleagues will have to find a place other than the Chamber to discuss these matters.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I ask about the Oireachtas appointment of inspectors to assist committees Bill in the light of the Ombudsman's advice that legal help should be available to Deputies to allow them to do their work, particularly in preparing legislation. However, this Bill is not to be found in the published list which has come before us. Has there been an inadvertent omission or has the Ombudsman annoyed the Government so much that it has decided to drop the one Bill that was seen to be of use in helping Deputies to do their work?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The contents of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill will now be in the investigation Bill. It has been moved into separate legislation which will be introduced.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	321	What will it be called?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	322	It will be the commission of investigation Bill and will be available this session.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	323	The Department of Education and Science proposes to publish an amendment Bill to inquire into child abuse. What are the technical amendments proposed to the principal Act?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	324	That is not appropriate to the Order of Business. The Deputy should submit a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The Taoiseach might want to explain it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The heads of the Bill were approved a few weeks ago and it is hoped to bring forward the Bill this session. They are largely technical amendments to the principal Act to allow for more effective and efficient operation of the Commission of Inquiry into Child Abuse.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The health (complaints) Bill will establish a statutory framework for the handling of complaints within the health services. Will the Taoiseach bring forward this Bill to an earlier date in view of the fact that there are many more complaints about the health service and I presume he would be expecting an increasing number when the Government cutbacks have an increasing impact on health care services? Can the Taoiseach ensure that at least people have a statutory recourse—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The Deputy will have an opportunity later this evening during the Private Members' motion to discuss the issue in detail.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	329	—when they find they cannot access the treatment to which they are entitled under the law?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	330	The Bill will be published next year.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Given that there is a serious legislative backlog in the health area, why does the list of Bills to be published up to the summer recess contain only one Bill from the Minister for Health and Children and none whose heads have been agreed? Item No. 73 on the programme refers to the health (complaints) Bill. In the programme published in autumn 2002, it was clearly indicated that the Bill would be introduced this year, but it will only be published this year.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	332	We cannot have a detailed discussion on it.

When will we see the health (complaints) Bill, the nurses Bill, and the medical practitioners Bill?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The heads of the health (complaints) Bill are expected towards the middle of this year and the legislation will be next year. The heads of the medical practitioners Bill are expected late this year and it will be next year before the Bill is introduced. The heads of the nurses Bill to amend the Nurses Act 1985 are expected this year but the legislation is unlikely to be enacted until next year.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	335	The health (complaints) Bill was on last autumn's programme.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I take it Deputy Ó Caoláin did not forget Standing Order 26 during the short recess.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	337	Amina Lawal, who has been condemned for the crime of adultery, is to be buried up to her neck and stoned to death.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	338	This does not arise on the Order of Business.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	339	Her death has been postponed for one month so that she can continue to nurse her baby.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The Deputy will have to find another way of raising the matter. I understand it is the subject matter of Question No. 272 on today's Order Paper in the name of Deputy Boyle and Deputy Mitchell should not anticipate the answer to his question.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	341	On today's Order Paper, there are two items, Votes 38 and 39 relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs. Yesterday a decision was taken to appoint an ambassador to Nigeria. I do not want that to proceed until this matter is addressed.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	342	The Deputy will have to find another way of raising the matter.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	343	We should not have any sort of civilised relations with a government and a supreme court that upholds such an horrific sentence.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The Deputy is out of order.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I am asking if Vote 38 can be taken on the floor of the House rather than at the committee to allow us to explore these matters. This is an outrageous uncivilised act for any government to participate in.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	346	There can be consultation about where it is taken.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	347	We should have the ambassador in.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	348	In the announcement in October for that Dáil session, in the announcement of January for the past session and now in the announcement for the current session, the education for persons with disabilities Bill has been highlighted. Can we get an assurance that the Bill will be published in this session and that the public will not be misled again?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	349	An enormous amount of work is going on to try to get that Bill through. It is the number one priority of all the legislation. It is a very important Bill, as the Deputy knows. It has to provide an overall statutory framework and what happens in that Bill will lead on to the disabilities Bill. It is hoped to try to get that Bill published in this session. There are a number of people from different Departments working on it because it is related to what happens afterwards in the disabilities Bill. I assure the Deputy that it is a priority.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	350	This is the third draft programme we have received from the Government since last September. We were then told that the charities Bill would be available in 2003. In January we were told it would be available in 2005 and this programme reveals that it will be available in 2004. Is the Bill being drafted by the national lottery?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	351	That is a frivolous question, Deputy. We move on now to Deputy Allen.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	352	May I ask the Taoiseach if that is the date and why does it keep changing?
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	353	Will the Taoiseach give an indication of when the following Bills are to be published so that we can arrange our business – the water services Bill and the residential property Bill? When will the House deal with the Protection of the Environment Bill which has gone through all Stages in the Seanad?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	354	The heads of the water services Bill have been approved and the Bill should be available this session. The Protection of the Environment Bill is in the Seanad.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	355	It has gone through.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	356	It has gone through the Seanad already and will be in the Dáil in the next few weeks.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	357	What about the residential property Bill?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	358	That will be published this month.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	359	What does the Taoiseach have to say to the 120 parents of severely disabled children in St. Vincent's day care centre on the Navan Road who are currently marching up and down in my constituency and in the Taoiseach's constituency because the respite care has been cut?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Does the Deputy have a question appropriate to legislation?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	361	What assurances can the Taoiseach provide in regard to both the education for persons with disability Bill and the disabilities Bill that the plight of these parents and their children will be addressed?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	362	That question was already answered.

The Bill is a simple enough one; why is it still outstanding and when are we likely to see it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	367	It is hoped that the Bill will be published during the summer for the autumn session. It will not be ready before the summer.

The news there is no retrospection will come as a great shock to the workers of Square D given that the Tánaiste told them she would do what she could for them only a couple of weeks ago.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The content of the Bill does not arise. The Taoiseach to reply on the question of the legislation.

I have tried to raise this matter but I have received no satisfaction whatsoever. Several families have been sold out by the Government.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I heard the Taoiseach reply to Deputy Allen that the residential tenancies Bill which used to be known as the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill will be published this month. On 29 January he told us it would be ready in a couple of weeks. On 12 February he told us it would be taken last session. On 12 March he gave the same reply. On 10 April the Tánaiste said it would be ready by the end of April.

I have asked many questions about this Bill. On 16 April, the Tánaiste told the House that the Bill would be published during the recess. What is delaying the Bill—

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	384	Deputy, the question has already been answered. We must move on.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	385	A Cheann Comhairle, I am not finished my question. I am asking the Taoiseach what is delaying the publication of this Bill and if it will definitely be published this month because—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The Taoiseach has already answered the question.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	387	—we have had repeated broken promises about this Bill.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I did say it would be published on some of those dates. It is an important Bill and there are a number of things to get right both legally and technically within the Department and the Attorney General's office which has delayed its publication. I have been assured –and I hope I do not have to correct myself again – that we will see the Bill this month.
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I wish to raise the issue of the Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Bill which aims to update the 1951 legislation. It was hoped that it could be dealt with at a local level in terms of the executive but the delays that have occurred are seriously stymieing development on the Foyle. I ask that this Bill be prioritised and dealt with as soon as possible because the people on the Foyle cannot wait.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	390	It is true to say that the Bill was delayed because the drafting of the text preceded it to try to make sure that publication would coincide with consultation and publication in Northern Ireland. The heads of the Bill have been approved for some considerable time. I will have the matter examined. The Bill was to be ready later on this year but I will check that for the Deputy.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	391	We were told that this Bill would be published before the end of this year, then it was to be before the summer recess and now it is not known when it will be published.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	392	Which Bill?
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The disabilities Bill. Is there a problem with it and can the Taoiseach give us some indication if it will be published this year or next year?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	394	As I explained earlier, the Bill is a priority as is the education for persons with disabilities Bill, both of which come together. We are endeavouring to complete the education for persons with disabilities Bill which will provide a framework for the disabilities Bill. That does not mean there is no work taking place on the disabilities Bill – there is a considerable amount of work. The view is that we must get the education for persons with disabilities Bill through because that provides the statutory framework which will relate to what happens afterwards for people with special needs. If possible, we aim to get that Bill published and passed this session which will allow work to proceed with the disabilities Bill.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	395	That is a change.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I am told by people involved with this important legislation, of whom there are many, that the logical thing to do is to get the education for persons with disabilities Bill through as that provides a framework to continue with the work in the other aspects and then we will try to get the disabilities Bill through the Houses. The intention is to pass both of them as soon as possible.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	397	When will the Bill be published?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	398	Not until the other Bill is passed after which the work on the disabilities Bill can be completed.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	399	The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill has gone through Second Stage in the House and has been before the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service for a considerable period of time without being dealt with. Will the Taoiseach consider the action, taken in similar situations where Committee Stage of a Bill is unduly delayed, to make an order to require the committee to deal with the Bill?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I am not familiar with the problem but I will check it for Deputy Stagg.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I thank the Taoiseach.

When will the Official Languages (Equality) Bill come before the Dáil? Will the Taoiseach prioritise the enforcement of fines Bill which will end imprisonment for offences like failure to pay a dog licence? A constituent of mine was in jail recently for 12 days for non-payment of a dog licence.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	403	The Taoiseach on the legislation. We cannot discuss the possible content of the Bill.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	406	The first Bill is at Report Stage in the Seanad so it will come forward. In regard to the enforcement of fines Bill, I do not have a date for it but work is at a preliminary stage of examination. There is an enormous number of Bills from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	407	It would be better if they left the dog alone and muzzled the Minister.

Do either of those Votes include any provision for RAPID? The latest casualty on the north side is the Bunratty Road apartments in Coolock.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	410	The Deputy has asked his question.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	411	A few weeks ago, the Taoiseach's party colleague, Deputy O'Connor, was distraught—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The Deputy cannot make a statement. I call the Taoiseach on the legislation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	413	—with the hassle he was getting in relation to the RAPID programme.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	414	We must move on so that we can conclude the statements on Northern Ireland before Private Members' time. I will take further questions from Deputies Howlin and Durkan and the Taoiseach may take the three questions together. I ask the Deputies to be brief.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I wish to ask two related questions on one of the most important issues affecting business, the cost of insurance here. The Government's legislative programme promises a personal injuries assessment Bill and an oddly titled Bill to reform the law on personal injuries, separate legislation. What is promised is that the heads of these Bills will be published. Is it intended to refer the heads of the Bill to the committee on enterprise, which is already conducting its own investigations in relation to this matter?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I wish to inquire as to the present condition and whereabouts of a couple of Bills. The defamation Bill has been lingering somewhere for some considerable time and the building control Bill has been under construction for quite a while. Members have been receiving correspondence from various interested parties. What is the present state of progress and what is the Government's intention in that regard? What is the position with the gas regulation Bill, which should generate some heat and the minerals development Bill? My final question relates to the Bill to replace the Official Secrets Act, the criminal justice (protection of confidential information) Bill. The progress of some of those Bills has not been spectacular. I wonder if progress can be expedited?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Members have asked about six Bills and I know the Ceann Comhairle is trying to keep within a time of 70 minutes. Perhaps I will just give the Deputies a note on the relevant Bills to save time. The Whistleblowers Protection Bill is on Committee Stage, as I indicated previously. In relation to the personal injuries assessment board Bill, I do not believe it was intended to publish the heads of the Bill. There are two Bills on this area, one from the Tánaiste and one from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, both of which are being given priority. The Bill in relation to the general scheme for the personal injuries assessment board is currently being drafted and is to be with the Government shortly. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is also giving priority to the Bill which relates to his Department.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	418	Is the Bill entitled a Bill to reform the law on personal injuries?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18315	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	421	Will the Taoiseach clarify whether it is the Bill, or the heads of the Bill, which will be published in this session? The legislative programme refers to the heads of the Bill.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	422	It is the heads of the Bill.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I thank the House for this opportunity to report on the latest developments in the peace process. I thank the Opposition leaders for agreeing to change the time arranged for the European debate.Members on all sides of the House have always expressed their overwhelming support for the Good Friday Agreement. I share the sense of regret and frustration that we have, so far, not succeeded in achieving the definitive progress that is essential to underpin the Agreement and assure the stability of the political institutions in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement was negotiated by representatives of all traditions on this island – Nationalist, republican, Unionist and loyalist. The Agreement truly belongs to all the people and all traditions on this island. The pro-Agreement parties and both Governments have a fundamental obligation to uphold the will of the people and secure the Agreement.All of us have a collective responsibility to make the Agreement work. This is not a policy option. It is the will of the people of both parts of the island, democratically endorsed in the May 1998 referendum.I assure the House that this is what we have been seeking to do over recent months and this effort, despite the current setback, will continue.Following the suspension of devolved government last October, Prime Minister Blair and I expressed our commitment to the full implementation of the Agreement. At that time, however, it was clear that devolved government could not be made to work effectively in circumstances where there had been a breakdown of trust between those involved. We simply could not go on as we had been. There was an obvious need to move forward decisively and bring completeness to all the outstanding issues if we were to guarantee the future. The issues distilled down to the necessity to remove concerns around the commitment to exclusively democratic and non-violent means and the need for each community to have confidence in the commitment of the representatives of the other to the full implementation of the Agreement.Over the past six months, the two Governments and the parties made enormous progress in our effort to reach a solution. Throughout this period, the two Governments worked in partnership and with the parties to try to drive the process forward and to ensure finality and clarity in our work. However, on Thursday last, we had to acknowledge that this phase of our efforts could not be brought to a conclusion at this time. Prime Minister Blair subsequently announced that he had made a decision to postpone the Assembly elections that had been re-scheduled for 29 May.I have stated clearly that the Government disagrees with the British Government on the postponement of these elections. I reiterated our view, which I know is shared by many members of the House, on this matter on several occasions directly to the Prime Minister. I believe that yet another postponement of the elections causes more problems for the process than it solves. However, while we do not agree or endorse this step, the closest of partnerships between the two Governments is essential to achieving continuing progress in Northern Ireland. That partnership remains strong and will continue. It is of enormous value as we work to overcome the current difficulties.The Prime Minister and I met yesterday and restated our commitment to our shared objective of completing the full implementation of the Agreement. The crux issue remains a deficit of trust between the parties. We will, in the coming weeks, focus our efforts and those of the pro-Agreement parties on remedying that deficit. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Secretary of State will meet shortly and will meet the parties in the near future to try to advance matters. The Joint Declaration and associated documents we published last week indicate very clearly the work we have been engaged in for the past six months. I have had a copy laid before the House.This declaration contains many elements which are not conditional upon action by others – for example in the areas of policing, criminal justice, equality, human rights and some aspects of demilitarisation.These will now be taken forward as part of the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, to which both Governments remain fully committed. Progress will be reviewed, where appropriate, within the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.The Joint Declaration is a document of considerable content and substance. It genuinely sought to bring completeness to a very considerable range of issues, including effective demilitarisation of Northern Ireland by April 2005, as well as a resolution of the "on-the-run" issue. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will address the substance of the Joint Declaration in greater detail during his intervention later.I regret that we did not manage to release the Joint Declaration in the context that was intended and understood by all the parties. Vitally, this would have included – from the very beginning of the negotiations last November it was understood by those concerned that it would have to include – a response from the IRA that there would be a definitive and unambiguous ending of all paramilitary activity. While the focus has been on the IRA, it was always clear that what we want is an end to republican and loyalist paramilitary activity alike.The negotiations throughout the six months from last November proceeded on this basis and with this clear understanding. The necessity for such clarity was as essential at the conclusion of the negotiations as it was when we embarked on this project. We were told that the IRA statement that we received on 13 April and which has now been published was definitive and would not be further amended or elaborated upon by the IRA. We welcomed the statement at the time. We said it contained many positive aspects. We said that it showed obvious progress and a clear desire to make the peace process work. However, as will be very obvious from a reading of this statement, there were several fundamental aspects in vital areas that both Governments felt had to be clarified in the context of the completeness we were seeking to achieve. It was not clear and unambiguous, as has been asserted. If it was, we would have been more than happy to embrace it and move on but it was not so we had to embark on a protracted process of clarification. We did this in a genuine attempt to advance matters. Specifically, we needed clarity regarding the circumstances in which the IRA would bring complete and final closure to the conflict. For example, was this in the context of a united Ireland or in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and other commitments? This is an important distinction, which was not at all clear from the IRA statement.We also needed clarity as to whether it was the IRA's intention to put all arms beyond use and we needed clarity that IRA activities of the type referred to in paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration were at an end. As I indicated to the House last November, these activities include military attacks, training, targeting, intelligence gathering, acquisitions and development of arms and weapons, other preparations for terrorist campaigns, punishment beatings, and attacks and involvement in riots. Moreover, the practice of exiling had to come to an end and the exiled had to be free to return in safety. These were basic questions to which we needed clear-cut answers that everybody could understand. Unfortunately, a great deal of time elapsed while the process of clarification was under way and elections were also getting closer.Overall, the environment in which clarifications were being sought and eventually being given was deteriorating. Let me assure the House that we applied every effort to try to achieve a satisfactory solution. This involved our sustained and undiluted attention. It involved a huge commitment by the Prime Minister and his officials. I commend their contribution as well as that of my colleagues the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and their officials, who were also actively and constructively involved at all stages in this effort.At every point we sought to support, encourage and bring satisfactory closure to this initiative. If I thought for one moment that we had achieved the clarity essential for our purpose, I would have said so and so, too, I am sure, would Prime Minister Blair. Our two Governments are deeply committed to this project. We wanted this initiative to work and we wanted a successful outcome. We wanted a major act of IRA weapons decommissioning which was in prospect but we knew also that, even though we were very close to success, we could not pretend that we were satisfied when we were not. I regret that the process of getting essential clarifications to basic questions was so protracted and that clarity on alleged IRA activities – an issue of such fundamental importance to confidence and trust and on which everything ultimately rested – was not forthcoming.Let me remind the House that it was precisely the issue of alleged IRA activities that undermined and eventually brought down the Executive last October. It is not a case of being unrealistic in our expectations and needs. Such alleged IRA activities were the crux of the issue last October; seven months later they remain central to the problem.The various statements by Gerry Adams were helpful and brought matters to a new level of clarity in relation to two vital aspects: first, the ending of the conflict and, second, the decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons. This has been acknowledged by both Governments.In the end, however, it did not prove possible to have sufficient clarity to convince everyone that paramilitary activity, the third issue, was definitively at an end. This is an issue that must be resolved satisfactorily in a way that everyone can understand. If the significance of Gerry Adams's clarifications were obvious and clear to many, they were not so clear to many others, including Unionists who must be persuaded if we are to make progress together.Convincing the two Governments is the first imperative but convincing and assuring moderate and reasonable Unionists is clearly also essential. Without the support of moderate and reasonable Unionists, it is very difficult to imagine how we are going to re-establish the devolved institutions and allow the Good Friday Agreement to reach its full potential.At the same time Unionists need to assure Nationalists that they are fully committed to the full operation of the Agreement, particularly in terms of the sustained operation of all the institutions. If the clarity required of the republican movement is forthcoming, it also needs to be clear that the phase of the stop-start operation of the Agreement has come to an end, that Unionists will fully and comprehensively engage in all the interlocking institutions of the Agreement, including the North-South Ministerial Council, and that they will accord full respect and legitimacy to the democratic mandates of their partners in government. It is important that the dialogue on these issues, which had been ongoing, is brought to a point where any doubts that exist in this regard are dispelled.I welcome last night's publication of the IRA statement of 13 April, as well as a further statement on the matter. It is helpful that this latter statement confirms that Gerry Adams's answers accurately reflect the IRA's position. The problem, however, is that Mr. Adams's answer to one of the questions was unclear, which means that this latest statement does not take the issue of IRA activities any further than Gerry Adams has done. This, therefore, remains an issue to be satisfactorily resolved.It is a great pity that the endorsement by the IRA of Gerry Adams's clarifications was not forthcoming at any stage during the period of 14 April to 1 May when these clarifications were being sought. Indeed, it was made clear to us that there was no question of asking, or expecting, the IRA to do anything or say anything of that sort. Their statement of 13 April was supposed to have said it all. I believe that an IRA endorsement would have been helpful – although I cannot say it would have been decisive – had it come earlier. At the same time, I do not now wish to minimise its significance and potential.We embarked on this task knowing that it was going to be difficult and that it might prove to be protracted. In the frustration and disappointment of recent days there is a natural tendency for recrimination but I will not engage in any such recrimination. Yes, there is disappointment but we must move on. The work that we have done over recent months will, I believe, have lasting value and purpose. The gains we have made – and there have been gains – must not be lost.I also deeply appreciate the assistance of President Bush and his Administration, particularly Ambassador Richard Haass who has worked closely with us in recent months. The successful negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement was the first time in modern Irish history where, working together, the different traditions on this island managed to agree a fair and balanced accommodation worthy of everyone's support.As the two Governments reiterated yesterday, the Agreement is our template for future relations on this island. It will not be re-negotiated. We know that politics in Northern Ireland can work. Despite the frustrations that people feel with politics and indeed with the political process, there is no alternative. We have achieved a lot – more than most people ever imagined we would. The outstanding issues have now crystallised: how can we ensure that the IRA will cease all paramilitary activity and how can we restore the institutions permanently?As we have done on many occasions since this process began, we will work with determination to resolve these difficulties. In the meantime, we expect all parties and groups to do their utmost to ensure a peaceful environment, particularly in the course of the forthcoming marching season. This in itself would be a major contribution to achieving a restored climate of trust and confidence that we can build upon. I would urge everyone, from all communities, to continue to constructively focus on the visions and ideals of the peace process and on the attainment of the key objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.I have been engaged in this process for many years now. It is at the centre of my political priorities. We have had our ups and downs in the last number of years. Last week was a temporary setback, in my view, but rather than slacken the pace at this time, we now need to pick it up and finish the job. I and my colleagues are dedicated to doing just that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Through the years, the Northern Ireland peace process has had more than its fair share of heart-stopping moments and now, almost at the end, there is one more – one that everyone hopes will be the last. It is impossible to overstate the magnitude and significance of what has been negotiated and achieved since this fragile process began. In five years, we began to solve what had proved historically unsolvable. We achieved what was previously and until recently quite unimaginable but despite those remarkable achievements it is still all to play for. Now, republicans and Unionists alike must be clear that their next move will decide the future of this island and its inhabitants for generations to come.Postponing the elections for the second time was deeply disappointing. Fine Gael regrets the British Government's decision but understands why it was necessary. Prime Minister Blair has shown an exemplary commitment to Northern Ireland and I have no doubt but that the decision to postpone the elections, yet again, was a difficult one for him and his Cabinet.As we know only too well, this is a frustrating time for all involved. It is over two months since the round-table talks at Hillsborough but the results of the shared understanding that was, by all accounts, arrived at, have yet to be delivered. The latest statements from the republican side are certainly encouraging. Their language is promising but they do not contain the levels of comfort and reassurance required by the Governments or pro-Agreement unionism at this critical stage. That reassurance will only be provided in a definitive, unambiguous announcement that all paramilitary activity on the part of republicans will end and that all weapons will be put beyond use.It goes without saying that demilitarisation is required across the entire political spectrum, including the normalisation of policing. This is not a big shift. Sinn Féin, like all sides, has conceded much in this process. It has come far and proven itself capable of taking the necessary risks. All that is required of Sinn Féin is to bridge the small but critical gap that remains. It can do this by stating clearly and unambiguously that it is committed to a solely democratic political agenda. The pro-Agreement Unionists, who have time and again proven their ability to compromise, must hold their nerve as they await that statement of comfort. They must recognise that the resilience of the institutions is finite and that there should be no question of their being suspended once again. The institutions must be allowed to work and solutions must take precedence over sanctions.The people of Northern Ireland have been bemused and enraged, at different times, by the Governments' peace efforts over the years. We have to believe that the purpose of the efforts, whether they originated in Dublin or London, was always to influence and facilitate, and never to interfere. People on all sides of the conflict gambled their political future – in some cases even their lives – during that era, particularly during the past five years. The gamble was taken by those with a bright vision of a better future of peace, confidence, prosperity and opportunity rather than bullets, bombs, hate and dread. I believe that such a bright future can still be achieved.I would like to pay tribute to those who have taken the historic gamble. I refer, of course, to the pro-Agreement parties that are working furiously and diligently to make this process work. In particular, I commend the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for their continued efforts. The British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, has shown remarkable courage and commitment to resolving the crisis in Northern Ireland and I thank him for his efforts. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Paul Murphy, has also played an important role in what we hope will be the end-game.I pay particular tribute to the officials on the Irish and British sides who have worked tirelessly, far from the camera lens. The officials working in the current Downing Street Administration, who in many ways are the real architects of this process, have been especially helpful. They receive little recognition for the huge role they play in understanding and resolving issues that have proved residually complex and contentious. Those involved in the peace process have recently withstood a few verbal grenades lobbed from the armchair – or from the environs of the pulpit – to create a workable and better future for the people of Northern Ireland. I respect the characteristic good grace shown by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in response to Dr. Paisley's deeply insulting remarks. The activists and supporters of those I have mentioned can brandish their credentials as risk takers, pragmatists, men and women of courage, principle and vision and, above all, as peace makers.Fine Gael supports the Good Friday Agreement unequivocally. It is a compromise and therefore imperfect, but no one, not even its most fierce detractors, has produced anything better. The Agreement remains our best and only hope. Fine Gael stands by the Agreement because the principles underpinning it are those it has articulated and defended since its foundation. We have always stood for a settlement based on reconciliation, mutual respect, understanding, democracy and power-sharing. When others may have been ambivalent, Fine Gael was unbending. It constantly and categorically rejected the use of violence to achieve political aims long before that principle was universally accepted. Fine Gael has never equivocated about the use of private armies. Since it founded this State, Fine Gael has stood resolutely behind the principle that a democracy can sustain only one legitimate army.The integral and historic role played by Fine Gael in the Northern Irish peace process over the years is one of which its members are extremely proud. Looking away was never an option, no matter how difficult the situation. My party led the Governments that brokered the precursors to the Good Friday Agreement – Sunningdale, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Framework Document – in politically turbulent and anxious times. I am quite sure the Taoiseach will accept that the agreement reached on Good Friday five years ago might never have come about without the earlier, frequently contentious and hard-won milestones on the path to peace.Fine Gael in opposition retains a patriotic and passionate commitment to Northern Ireland and its people. It has never played politics with this issue and has supported the Government staunchly throughout the process. As the leader of a party with quite a few new members, I have worked in recent months to forge stronger links with political parties and groupings in Northern Ireland. I pay tribute to members of the SDLP, some of whom are present in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, for the outstanding efforts that party has made in terms of policing in recent years. Fine Gael has undertaken a series of visits to Northern Ireland to meet parties and community groups across the divide, from Tigers Bay and Short Strand to Cluan Place and Holy Cross. All sides can be assured that my party will continue to do what it can to promote peace, prosperity and mature consensus on this island. The Good Friday Agreement must be implemented in full if the peace dividend is to be understood. Such implementation can only be achieved through political impetus. The process has stalled and stagnation will not only ruin the process, but it will also ruin lives.When the bomb squad returned to our streets yesterday after almost 30 years, those of us in Dublin glimpsed what a political vacuum can bring. Such events explain why my party believed it was essential, if at all possible, for the elections to go ahead as planned. Like nature, politics abhors a vacuum, so I am calling on the two Governments to convene round table talks with all the pro-Agreement parties as a matter of urgency. If such parties could come together in a single room in Hillsborough recently to meet President Bush and if they are serious about clarification outstanding in terms of language and what that means, surely we can come together as mature political leaders to discuss the future.The documents on both sides are now in the public domain. The work done by the officials on both sides can be implemented in part but surely there is no reason politicians on both sides cannot now sit down, face to face, to hammer out a solution to the unresolved and contentious issues. Unionists can hold up the documents and say "here is where we need more", thereby giving republicans yet another opportunity to deliver with the requisite clarity. Republicans need to get over their enduring suspicion of Unionism – that no matter what Sinn Féin publishes, it will never be enough. Unionism must respond by ensuring that institutions which are finite have consistency and longevity. I would love Gerry Adams to explain what his pledge not to undermine the Agreement actually means.Am I correct in my understanding that IRA training is continuing in Donegal and that there were three paramilitary punishment beatings last week, one republican and two loyalist? Does undermining the Agreement mean vans of men with black balaclavas taking like wolverines to the streets of Bray and towns like it? There must be clarity in this regard also, not just for Northern Ireland politicians but for the ordinary people of the entire country.The institutions provided for in the Agreement can still be the bedrock of peace and prosperity on this island. As that great architect of peace, Jean Monnet, put it: "rien n'est possible sans les hommes, rien n'est durable sans les institutions"– nothing is possible without the people but nothing will last without the institutions. For the sake of the future generations of Northern Ireland, the two sides must come – I hope for the last time – to the edge in a final effort to bring conclusion to this problem, in respect of which we have all come so far with so many concessions and so much understanding.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	433	For several weeks there has been a strong belief in the community at large that a major breakthrough was about to happen in the peace process. Negotiations have been taking place, with apparently increasing urgency and intensity, about the concept of acts of completion. Decisions have been taken by the Government and apparently by the Provisional IRA that put flesh on the bones of this concept. All this led to considerable hope that the Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive could be restored prior to the elections due to be held in May.Suddenly and at the last minute, that hope was dashed. Instead of progress, a seemingly irreconcilable stalemate has arisen. Hope of considerable progress has been replaced by disappointment. Arising from that stalemate, the British Government has taken a decision to postpone Assembly elections that flies in the face of some very fundamental principles. The Irish Government, though it has publicly objected to that decision, has taken care to make it clear that it supports the general position of the British Government, that both Governments are at one in all essential respects.We, in this House, are left to wonder about whether it was right to postpone the elections. We have to ask ourselves also what has caused the stalemate and who is responsible, and we have to seek to establish what the next steps are.I have already said, and I repeat, that while I understand some of the anxieties that have arisen about possible outcomes to elections in these difficult circumstances, it is hard to find any normal reason that would justify the postponement of the elections. It is unacceptable in any normal scheme of things that the people can be arbitrarily deprived of the right to vote. While I recognise that the present situation in Northern Ireland is a politically difficult one, it is not so far outside the norm that so radical a decision is justifiable. The day we in this House support a proposition that the likely outcome of an election constitutes a good reason for postponement is the day we are on a slippery slope.It seems that the stalemate has been caused, essentially, by a lack of good grace on one side of the issue, the republican side, and by a lack of courage on the other, the Unionist side. What should have been a genuinely historic moment, at some point in the past couple of weeks, has, as a result and at least for the time being, passed us by.Until today I had not seen the statement given by the IRA to the two Governments. We had been told that it lacks clarity to such an extent that the Governments simply could not be sure what the Provisional IRA was saying. We now know that in that statement the IRA was responding to the text of the Joint Declaration published in April. Although the Oireachtas had no sight of that document until it was made public, it is clear from references in the IRA statement that it did.It is certainly true that there is ample clarity in the Joint Declaration. Paragraphs 13 and 14 of the document make it clear that the two Governments expected the following: that paramilitarism and sectarian violence would be brought to an end; that there would be an immediate, full and permanent cessation of all paramilitary activity, including military attacks, training, targeting, intelligence gathering, acquisition or development of arms or weapons, other preparations for terrorist campaigns, punishment beatings and attacks and involvement in riots; that the practice of exiling would come to an end and the exiled must feel free to return in safety; that sectarian attacks and intimidation directed at vulnerable communities would cease; that all paramilitary groups would actively engage with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning with a view to putting arms beyond use in a manner conducive to creating public confidence; and that all parties should, in accordance with the Agreement, use their influence to encourage and support the completion of that process.It is perhaps worth saying here – indeed, I feel I have no choice but to say it – that in setting out that list of requirements, the two Governments were speaking on behalf of every citizen throughout this island who voted for the Good Friday Agreement. Furthermore, I cannot for the life of me see the difficulty of responding to that list with the plainest of plain English. Yet it does not seem to have been possible for the IRA to do so. I have to say that if I were looking for a response to the list of proposals above and I got the IRA statement handed to the Governments on 13 April, I would require clarification.The best the IRA could do was say:We are resolved the see the complete and final closure of this conflict. The IRA leadership is determined to ensure that our activities, disciplines and strategies will be consistent with this. Furthermore, the full and irreversible implementation of the Agreement and other commitments will provide a context in which the IRA can proceed to definitively set aside arms to further our political objectives. When there is such a context, this decision can be taken only by a general army convention representing all volunteers.Not only does that statement beg for additional clarification, I simply cannot see how it can form a basis for a resolution. There are several references throughout the IRA statement to the need to address Unionist concerns, and one rather patronising remark about a "firm pledge by the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party that he will actively support the sustained working of the political institutions."  However, nowhere is there language that Unionists could possibly be expected to accept at face value. It is almost as if the Provisional IRA was only willing to address Unionist concerns in some code or dialect of its own. I say that conscious of the fact that, in respect of the remarks Deputy Kenny made about some of the louder voices on the Unionist side in Northern Ireland, it would be a great contribution to the process if, when arms are decommissioned as I hope they soon will be by the IRA, that particular man would decommission his tribal hatred.

Mr. Adams has sought on several occasions to bring clarity to this situation. In fairness, it has to be said that if he were not somewhat hamstrung by the nature of that secretive organisation, he might have been able to go even further. It certainly seemed that he wanted to.Nonetheless, in assessing the various statements issued, it is important to say that for some months now members of Sinn Féin have been actively engaged in promoting the understanding that a major step – what Prime Minister Blair once referred to as a seismic shift – was indeed under way. The Joint Declaration, apparently prepared in anticipation of such a shift but written before the Governments had sight of the IRA statement, refers in Annex 1 to "the historic leap forward by the IRA."We are left to wonder why, if the IRA was prepared to countenance the kind of historic leap suggested by the list of acts of completion, outlined earlier, they were not prepared to say so in simple language. Paramilitary activity is defined in the Joint Declaration by reference to specific activities – military attacks, training, targeting, intelligence gathering, punishment beatings and so on. One possibility, to eliminate all doubt, would be to say "Yes" to each of them specifically. Another would be a simple statement that confirmed a shared understanding of the definition of paramilitary activity and an assertion that all such activity would cease. Instead, only convoluted phraseology was offered, then clarified, then somewhat elaborated upon, eventually leading to the assertion by Gerry Adams, on behalf of the IRA, that all activities would cease.From that point on, direct questions to Sinn Féin spokespersons began to be answered with the mantra, "What is it about 'all activities' that you don't understand?"  One might be tempted to answer with the question, "Is there any one of the specific activities that you don't want to be questioned about?"  Even if we take the clarification as meaning what we all hope it means, that the IRA has decided that the war is over, the bottom line may be that the clarification offered was too little, too late. It was certainly too late and as we know now, in the original IRA statement this cessation of all activities was still to be conditional on the IRA's assessment, at some future time, of the extent of compliance by all other parties and only if it secured a vote in favour at a subsequent IRA convention.Whatever chance there was of persuading David Trimble to once more expose himself to the taunts of the DUP and the machinations of some of his own members, it disappeared in the welter of confusion that surrounded the various claims and counter-claims made about the IRA position. A failure of nerve on the Unionist side thus appeared to end whatever hope there was of rescuing this phase of the peace process. Given the opaqueness of the IRA statement, that failure of nerve is perhaps not all that surprising. It seems somewhat unreasonable to expect Mr. Trimble to interpret the real meaning of IRA statements to his own sceptical council. This was an opportunity lost at several levels. Normal society in Northern Ireland needs a sustained period not just of peace but of stability and relative certainty about the future. We have all noted how taking the violence out of conflict has not ended the conflict. If anything, the bitterness within and between the communities and the sense of polarisation has increased since the violence ended.A clear and unequivocal statement by the IRA, together with acceptance by the Unionist leadership that the future was about democratic politics, would, and hopefully still will, be a crucial next step in reconciliation and the development of normal relationships. What is to be done now? I understand the Governments will initiate a new round of discussions with the parties in Northern Ireland, and I welcome that. There is no good reason the bona fides of all parties should not be tested in the months ahead. If the IRA, despite a lack of clarity, is intent on delivering an end to violence of all kinds, the British Government should perhaps be just as intent on delivering those aspects of the normalisation process it describes in the Joint Declaration.We are heading into what is traditionally the danger period in Northern Ireland where a political vacuum, as referred to by Deputy Kenny, stands a good chance of being filled by a variety of sectarian voices, activities and attitudes. It is vital that we seek to make progress, that we not waste time in recrimination, as the Taoiseach said, and that we not be too cast down by the squandering of opportunity. We should perhaps remember that when Senator Mitchell first arrived on the scene in Northern Ireland, it was not to chair the all-party talks leading to the Good Friday Agreement but as a necessary preliminary to those talks, to produce his report on decommissioning.The Mitchell principles of democracy and non-violence, set out more than seven years ago, are essentially what we have been trying to achieve ever since. Those principles included, among others, total and absolute commitment to democratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political issues; the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations; and the taking of effective action to bring an end to punishment killings and beatings.Seven years after Mitchell's first report, we still cannot say with certainty that we have arrived at the point where all the key participants in the process are equally committed to the public expression of those principles but it appears to be the case that we are closer than ever and for that reason alone I urge both Governments to redouble their efforts in the weeks and months ahead.Above all, we should not listen to any more talk of vetoes. The reality, when it comes to allegations of the veto being wielded, is that all the major players in the North have a veto and the SDLP is the only party which has not sought to exercise it. The Good Friday Agreement is itself designed so that it can only work if there is a majority of both traditions who support its terms and who work actively to implement it.The draft-resignation-in-my-back-pocket approach of David Trimble has been destructive of cohesion over time. The on-again off-again approach to the institutions, at the stroke of a secretary of state's pen, has been damaging. The failure of the IRA to be willing to express in clear and simple terms that it accepts the inevitable logic of the Agreement and the demands it places on it has applied the brakes very sharply to progress. Only by pressing on and insisting that the actions outlined in the Joint Declaration will be implemented will the Governments be able to get across the message that vetoes will no longer be allowed to damage the welfare of the people of Northern Ireland.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	439	It is important that we are honest about the decisions that have been taken. The paramilitary campaign of the Provisional IRA is over. It was a cul-de-sac from the very beginning for both working class communities in the North. I welcome the realisation of that among republicans, belated as it might have been, but Prime Minister Blair knows it is over as well. He did not postpone the elections because he believed the Provisional IRA would resume paramilitary activity. Neither did he postpone the elections because of Mr. Paisley's despicable and bigoted outburst, which was another reason that was attempted to be given. The British Government postponed the elections because it did not like the perceived likely outcome to those elections, which it perceived to be the strengthening of the anti-Good Friday Agreement Unionists and Sinn Féin emerging as the strongest party on the other side. The British Government is going down a very dangerous road in denying the people of Ireland a democratic say, for reasons such as that.There was no election on this occasion because there was no pre-election agreement between Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionists but every time an election approaches, the same issue will arise. The Ulster Unionists will shy away from a pre-election agreement. They are looking over their shoulders at the DUP because of the growing disillusion and anti-Agreement feeling within the Protestant community. We have not been given a specific date for the postponed elections. The British Government is vague on whether elections will be held in the autumn, and I would like to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs comment on that.The fundamental problem is that the structures put in place under the Good Friday Agreement institutionalised sectarian division and have done nothing to overcome division. Unfortunately, the opposite has been the case on the ground. There is no problem getting politicians, most of them of a right wing hue, to make agreements among themselves. They would like to have agreements and divide the spoils. Unfortunately, however, divisions on the ground have intensified and that has underlined the reluctance of the Ulster Unionist Party to make an agreement.The power sharing executive was sceptically viewed by both Catholics and Protestants in the North and there was a question as to whether it made a difference to the lives of ordinary people or improved them in any way. It was a legitimate question when they saw the Executive faithfully carrying out the right wing economic and social policies of Mr. Blair, including private finance initiatives and privatisation in health, education and other services.It is to be welcomed, therefore, that the campaigners to retain the acute status of the Tyrone Hospital, Omagh, signalled their intention to contest the Assembly elections. This represents ordinary people beginning to move into the political process directly, which must happen. A crowd of 100,000 marched against sectarian killings and intimidation in January 2002. The instinct of ordinary working class people and trade union and community activists is for unity but that must be given a political expression. It is the 105th anniversary of Jim Larkin and James Connolly leading large movements across the sectarian divide in the North by addressing the social and economic ills that affected the Protestant working class. A new movement of that character is needed to address the current situation.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	440	Green Party members, North and South, are deeply disappointed at the postponement of the 29 May elections. While electoral politics have not been put beyond use as is the intention with arms, they are being postponed in a dangerous way. The Green Party does not come from an ethnocentric analysis of this type of conflict. We have a global perspective, believing that if one thinks globally, one should act locally. We are rooted in the peace movement and do not have time for the physical force tradition.However, we respect diversity, which should be the hallmark of republicanism. Unfortunately, republicanism has been marked by a strong armed approach to gain the upper hand in a debate such as this. There are people who cannot be republican because it represents too narrow a context for them. That is dangerous because terrorism thrives in certain contexts. The "us and them" context and the divisiveness that has been a hallmark of this conflict need to be removed.The Good Friday Agreement contains a number of flaws but it is the only show in town. It must be clearly stated again and again to all who might think otherwise that there will not be renegotiation of the Agreement and it must be made work. Clarity of language is needed in that regard. It was a fudged Agreement in much of its wording. However, in the context of clarity of language, Sinn Féin and the IRA should recognise that in the past statements were made, and taken at face value in many cases, that, for example, civilians would not be killed in various actions but, unfortunately, they were. Considerable wording has proven not to stand the test of time and there is a need to re-establish the trust that has been lost and the confidence that has been shattered down the years. That will take time and it will take patience on the part of Sinn Féin and the IRA to answer the same questions again and more fully than previously.I do not know, for example, whether Sinn Féin accepts that the Joint Declaration meets its requirement for full implementation of the Agreement. We still need answers from the IRA regarding what it believes full implementation means. We still need to know what activities the IRA will continue as well as those that will be abandoned. Will the IRA become an ex-prisoners fundraising organisation or one that commemorates various historic events? These questions are valid and need to be answered if trust is to be re-established to allow the Agreement to be fully and fairly implemented for all sides.It is ironic that this year we commemorate the rising of Robert Emmet in 1803, a time when republicanism was clearly the unified wish of Catholics, Protestants and the centre. We are, unfortunately, looking on at republicanism while it is at a low ebb. It is seen to be divisive and we need to reclaim the inclusiveness, which was the ideal of Robert Emmet's time, without forcing agendas.It must also be recognised that politics is becoming less relevant as we talk about different sides in this debate, given that the World Trade Organisation is organising corporate power to sideline political dialogue and the relevance of democratic institutions. That must be borne in mind as it is not only a case of who wins the day in Northern Ireland or what is the result of the discussions but is also a case of facing up to the fact that unless we can reclaim democratic politics for everybody on both islands, corporate power will move in and take whatever power is needed.

In this charade the two Governments have pretended in public that the IRA's unprecedented statement of that date, which was published yesterday, was insufficient for them. They have tried to fool the people into believing that a clarification provided by Gerry Adams on 27 April was also inadequate in their eyes and they have claimed that even further clarification provided by Gerry Adams on 30 April, one week ago, did not go far enough.I assert that these claims by both Governments are totally false and I point to a reality a majority of Irish people now recognise. The unprecedented initiative by the IRA and the best efforts of Sinn Féin have been rejected and rubbished by the nominal leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, and both Governments have carried on this charade to protect Mr. Trimble from the political consequences of his actions.The demands of Mr. Trimble are insatiable because they are meant to be insatiable and he continues to be indulged by the British Prime Minister. Neither the British Prime Minister nor the Taoiseach is prepared to say to David Trimble "enough is enough" while they are always ready to demand more from republicans. The question is, why? The answer is that they know that the republican commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process is solid. However, in shielding David Trimble, and in taking republican commitment for granted, the Governments have damaged and undermined the very Agreement they claim to uphold and they have caused anger and resentment among republicans, deep and justifiable anger that will make the task of rebuilding the political process all the more difficult.I accuse the Irish government of a dereliction of its duty and of helping to pave the way for the disgraceful decision by Tony Blair to ban an Irish election. When that decision was announced in London on May Day, we had weak statements of dissent from the Government in Dublin. At Farmleigh House yesterday, in his opening remarks to the media the Taoiseach did not even mention the banning of the Assembly elections. This act against Irish democracy by a British Government was merely alluded to as a temporary setback.The two Governments' Joint Declaration states on its first page: "The best way of ensuring that peace remains permanent is by demonstrating that politics work."  How did the British Government "demonstrate that politics work" on the very day the declaration was published? It did so by postponing the Assembly elections indefinitely. The British Government had no right to do this but it acted in time-honoured Westminster fashion where the rights of Irish people are concerned. It seems that the British Government has yet to make, in the words of the Joint Declaration, "the transition to exclusively democratic means."Martin McGuinness, the chief negotiator for Sinn Féin, was told by David Trimble that no matter what the IRA said or did he would not call an Ulster Unionist council meeting and return to the executive ahead of the Assembly elections. Jeffrey Donaldson is now the real leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, which he pulled into the anti-Agreement camp last September. He has already rejected the Joint Declaration. I believe that Sinn Féin has gone far more than the extra mile to break the impasse in this peace process. Any objective reading of the Good Friday Agreement will show that we have long fulfilled all our obligations.These are realities which some on the Government benches may not like to hear but they must be recognised if we are to move forward. We cannot go forward on the basis of what I have described as a charade. We cannot go forward on the basis that the Irish Government is an honest broker. We have heard a lot about clarification but the Taoiseach has yet to clarify that assertion from his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Irish Government is a co-equal partner in the Agreement with the British Government. The British Government acts in British interests as it sees them. The Irish Government must act in the Irish national interest. For decades, while it was carrying on a brutal war in Ireland, a war highlighted most recently by the Stevens Report, the British Government pretended to be the referee keeping the so-called two warring sides apart. Are we now to have that tragedy repeated as farce with both Governments pretending to be neutral arbiters while the Unionist veto is allowed to succeed again?This process will be rebuilt and we in Sinn Féin will play our part to the full. Let both Governments note that it can be built on nothing less than the rights of the Irish people and that no matter how it is resisted or delayed, change is unstoppable.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I am conscious of and very grateful for the support and encouragement which is forthcoming from all sides of the House for our endeavours in the implementation of this Agreement. I also value the opportunity to speak on the proposals which the Governments have agreed to take forward at this stage, as indicated by the Taoiseach in his statement. Since I last spoke in the House on Northern Ireland issues, there have been a series of developments, some positive and others less so.The underlying aim of all the work undertaken by the two Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland since last October has been to address the deficit in confidence which had arisen about the commitment on all sides to the full and inclusive operation of all aspects of the Agreement. We undertook this work in the full awareness that it would be difficult and might not be resolved quickly. Our intensive engagement continued through the months that followed and, after much painstaking effort and slow grind, a full and complete audit of all areas of the Good Friday Agreement which remained to be fully implemented was developed.This blueprint, which was published last week as the Joint Declaration by the British and Irish Governments, was part of an overall package which we described as acts of completion. This requires a renewed and clear commitment to a definitive end to all paramilitary activity. It also requires an unequivocal commitment to the full and inclusive operation of all of the institutions of the Agreement.The last weeks have seen detailed discussions and contacts among the Governments and the parties, and we eventually arrived at a situation which came close to securing a resolution of the problems that have bedevilled progress on repeated occasions. That was not part of a pretence or charade. It was part of an attempt to resolve the matter to everyone's satisfaction, but, to the regret and disappointment of all sides, despite great progress and advances which went far beyond what might have been imagined possible by the naysayers and cynics, it was not possible to achieve a final agreement at this point.The requirement for clarity on the end to all paramilitary activity inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement is not a matter of mere semantics or word games. The Governments did not arbitrarily demand certain words from republicans for our own satisfaction. As I have made clear, our aim from the outset was to address the real deficits of trust and confidence on the ground in Northern Ireland. This can only be done by offering clarity and certainty that all paramilitary activity is coming to an end. In the Dáil last November, the Taoiseach stated that this required immediate, full and permanent cessation of the kind of paramilitary activities now listed in paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration. That has been the position since last November.The clarifications provided throughout the process by the Sinn Féin leadership have been helpful and positive. I welcome as a positive development the indication in yesterday's IRA statement that the answers provided by the Sinn Féin leadership accurately represented their position.There remains an ambiguity about whether the full range of activities described in paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration has been dealt with. Unless this aspect of the issue is addressed to the satisfaction of everyone, the prospect of inclusive partnership government being restored is unlikely to be translated into reality.It was in this context that the decision was taken by the British Government not to proceed with the Assembly elections which had been scheduled for 29 May. As the Taoiseach made clear in his statements, the Government disagreed with the British Government on the postponement of these elections. That opinion was made clear to the British Government throughout our contacts, including at two meetings by me with Secretary of State Paul Murphy in Belfast on that Monday, 28 April. I was not involved in a pretence or charade when I represented the Government's views on that matter either. They were sincere, straightforward, consistent views of the Government that were put to the British Government on that occasion.

The Taoiseach is working on behalf of the people, with others, trying to move might and main to achieve a solution to this problem. When I make the effort and recognise the contribution of others I expect the contribution of the Government to be given the same generosity of spirit. I am prepared to give that recognition to anybody who sincerely tries to resolve this problem.Whatever we think and whatever people's view might be, in terms of who we are dealing with or the difficulties we might have in certain areas of policy, everybody, collectively, is trying to resolve this problem. The attitude and tone of some of what I have had to hear this evening does not add to the prospect of solving it or moving it forward. It might settle constituency nerves in some quarters but it does not add value to what needs to be done to resolve this problem. When I do not question anyone else's sincerity I will not have the sincerity of the Government questioned.However, this disagreement does not reflect any rift in the wider partnership that continues between the two Governments as co-guarantors of the Agreement, which is strong and well able to withstand some differences of view among equal partners. That must be the case if we are to solve this problem. Indeed, during yesterday's meeting at Farmleigh, we discussed the basis on which we propose to move forward together in the new circumstances.The Government put forward its views clearly and unequivocally as to what the requirements now are. In the event of institutions not having been restored, which they were not, there is a default mechanism in the Good Friday Agreement and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, for which I have responsibility to represent the Government and the Irish people in respect of what needs to be done in that area. I will discharge those responsibilities and I will not be in dereliction of my duty in so doing.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	452	We fully agreed that the task of the two Governments would be to work together to bring about the conditions under which full confidence can be restored on all sides. We also agreed that those aspects of the Joint Declaration which are not contingent on acts of completion by others will now be taken forward. When the Joint Declaration is fully analysed, most commentators will have to agree that it is broad and ambitious in its scope. From criminal justice to human rights to the issues relating to victims of the conflict, it is alive with opportunity for real and tangible progress and we are determined to work closely in the coming months to bring it to full realisation.As Deputies will be aware, certain aspects of the Joint Declaration are explicitly dependent on acts of completion by paramilitary organisations. However, by no means is all progress dependent on those acts of completion. Such conditionality would be at variance with the Agreement which regarded key concepts such as equality and human rights as being automatic entitlements. Instead, a broad range of proposals in the Joint Declaration will be brought forward, for example, in the areas of policing, criminal justice, equality, human rights and some aspects of security normalisation. We are determined that they should be taken forward since they form part of the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference will have an important role to play in reviewing progress. I expect there will be an early meeting of the conference, which I will co-chair with the Secretary of State in the latter half of this month.Significant developments are achievable in the area of criminal justice reform. The Government looks forward to the publication of the implementation plan for the criminal justice review which should promote greater confidence in the justice system among all parts of the community. An open competition is under way to appoint an independent oversight commissioner to provide independent scrutiny of the implementation of the criminal justice review. In addition, statements of ethics will be introduced this year for all criminal justice agencies in Northern Ireland which do not currently have them.In the Joint Declaration the British Government stated that it will bring forward a second criminal justice Bill which will, among a number of detailed measures, allow for the creation of a reflective judicial appointments commission prior to the devolution of responsibility for criminal justice matters. It will also make further provision to promote a human rights culture in the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland as well as other key provisions which have long been sought by representatives of the Nationalist community. I look forward to the early publication of this Bill.The two Governments are committed to working in partnership to develop structures and arrangements for enhanced co-operation on criminal justice matters. The scope of co-operation for our mutual benefit will be wide-ranging and practical. A group of policy makers from both jurisdictions will meet at the end of this month to identify and advise on the opportunities for co-operation at governmental level and between agencies.Under the broad heading of policing the Joint Declaration offers scope for further progress on the elimination of baton rounds, with the confirmation of the British Government's intention that, on the basis that an acceptable and less lethal alternative is available, they should not be used after the end of this year.

In view of the importance of the matters I am discussing, I would like, with the agreement of the House, to put them on the record.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The legislation necessary for secondments and lateral entry from the Garda Síochána to the PSNI and vice versa passed all Stages in the Seanad on 9 April and will be introduced before this House in the coming weeks. North-South police co-operation is progressing apace, with the continuing implementation of the Patten recommendations on structured co-operation. The Police Act 2003 will also implement all the recommendations of the revised implementation plan, including giving greater powers to the Policing Board.On the key issue of security normalisation, while there is certainly a direct link in this area to acts of completion by paramilitary groups, there is still scope for some further progress in the direction of the full normalisation of security arrangements. In particular, I hope to see early movement in the dismantling of some of the intrusive towers in south Armagh and in the ongoing assessments by the Policing Board of the progress which can be made in the further normalisation of policing structures and patrols.In the area of human rights and equality, so central to the ethos of the Agreement, the Joint Declaration offers ample scope for further progress. In relation to the bill of rights, for example, work has already begun among some of the parties, through the implementation group of pro-Agreement parties, on the creation of a round table forum, inclusive of the parties and civic society, on a bill of rights for Northern Ireland. The work which has already taken place among the parties on this subject is ripe for further development and I look forward to seeing concrete progress on this issue in the near future. At the conclusion of the proposed round table process, the British Government is committed to bringing forward legislation at Westminster on a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.Equality is the cornerstone of the Agreement. I look forward to the continuing work which will be undertaken on a range of measures to combat the unemployment differential. These measures will be aimed at progressively eliminating the differential in unemployment rates between the two communities by targeting objective need. The British Government is also committed to encourage funding to be made available for research for this purpose.While the detail of issues such as the unemployment differential might seem arcane or obscure to some, it is in the cut and thrust of such areas that the impact of the Agreement on individual lives can be most clearly experienced. The entrenchment of the knowledge that employment is dependent solely on merit and that the equality provisions of the Agreement are being given tangible expression are clear manifestations of positive change.Co-operation between North and South in the economic and social arena has never been stronger and will continue to develop. The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement have provided the opportunity for a strategic and structured approach to co-operation on this island in all the key policy areas, including health, education, environment and agriculture. In addition, two important new players in the commercial field are InterTradelreland, the all-island trade and business development body charged with improving the traditionally low levels of North-South trade on the island and Tourism Ireland Limited, responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a single destination. The successful operation of these two North-South bodies, with the other bodies dealing with special EU programmes, our waterways and loughs, food safety and language, continue to be critical to the economic, cultural and social well-being of the island. North-South co-operation has consistently delivered real, practical results and is of mutual benefit to both parts of the island. It has a key role to play in strengthening relationships between and within communities on the island.To draw my remarks to a close, I would like the House to be clear that the Government remains completely committed to the Good Friday Agreement, not merely as a mantra to be repeated in current difficulties, but as an active and continually developing commitment which is deep and unshakeable. As the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair made clear yesterday, the question of a renegotiation simply does not arise.Notwithstanding the frustration of the past few weeks, which I recognise, the Good Friday Agreement remains the only workable or acceptable template for progress within Northern Ireland and on this island. The Governments are wholeheartedly committed to continuing to make it work. The Joint Declaration, our template for full implementation of the Agreement, which was made public last week, is now also the shared agenda for action between the two Governments. We will do all within our power to make rapid progress in the areas it covers.While the two outstanding issues of paramilitary activity and full operation and stability of the institutions remain to be finally clarified, the two Governments will continue to meet and maintain contact with all parties. We are also committed to encouraging open and comprehensive dialogue on the outstanding issues between the parties. This dialogue would provide the optimum context, through the facilitation of mutual confidence and trust, in which the elections this autumn should take place. We have faced many tests and a number of stumbling blocks in the five years since the Agreement was reached. However, we are determined that the present difficulties will be overcome, as others have been in the past.I wish to relate to the House a personal anecdote concerning an event at the weekend. A good friend of mine who is facing a huge challenge in terms of his health wrote to me to give encouragement about what we are trying to achieve. The fact that, at a time when he was facing such real personal problems, he took the time to say he wanted the peace process to work, married as he is to a Belfast woman who is aware of the problems, difficulties and perceptions, should perhaps encourage others in this House and outside to show more generosity and start thinking about the ordinary people who want this problem solved and believe we can solve it if we can muster sufficient courage and trust in our mutual ability to overcome the legacy of the past, a legacy of injustice and discrimination. It is now up to this generation to shape our history. On the cusp of achieving it, let us not recoil to the bad old days or the bad old thinking. Whatever the difficulties, they are not insurmountable. I will think of my friend, rather than some others who have reminded me of that legacy this evening, in the days and months ahead as we try to resolve this problem because he represents the real will of the people.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I heard the Minister for Health and Children tell the people this morning on radio that there is no health crisis. That will be a relief to the thousands of people on waiting lists who, by the same logic, must only imagine they are ill. The other thing which came vividly to mind was the story of the emperor with the new clothes. The Minister must feel unlucky when he reflects on the events of recent weeks. He must feel that the gods who shone on him in the past have turned their backs on him as he faces disaster in every direction he turns. I am sure he felt unlucky that a new and dangerous disease emerged on his watch, that public health doctors were on strike when it emerged, that it happened just as the Special Olympics was about to be hosted in Ireland, that the system appeared hopelessly unable to cope with the SARS threat and that the public reaction to this apparent ineptitude was only short of outright panic. He must have felt unlucky that communication within the health service and between the health service and the public was so confused and contradictory it would have been laughable if it had not been so frightening. To outside observers, the handling of this crisis reached the realms of high farce.If this was a new Government and the Minister was newly appointed, we could put it down to sheer bad luck. If this was a fledgling Government struggling to find its feet, we would give it the benefit of the doubt and say it was a victim of circumstances. However, the Minister is not newly appointed and it is not a new Government. I will not go back over the past 16 years of almost unbroken Fianna Fáil Government because the last six are enough. We have had six years of unprecedented wealth and spending. We have had six long years of opportunities foregone. The Minister had all the money in the world with which to make his own luck, but he did not use it. He and his Cabinet colleagues must be held accountable for that. That is why the motion is before the House. The flaws in the health service, which we saw glaringly in the past few weeks and which we will see again next week, are flaws of the Minister's making. The responsibility for every decision not taken in the health service, every investment not made and every reform postponed, rests with the Minister. Those failures cannot be put down to bad luck. They are the inevitable result of a failure of decisive political leadership and all the spin doctors in the world cannot disguise that fact.There is a crisis of confidence in the health service. This is caused not just by the grossly inadequate, confused and confusing handling of the SARS threat, but by the daily, unremitting onslaught of media stories about more frightening and heartbreaking failures of the health service. The failure to manage the SARS crisis is seen as symptomatic of the more general failure of the Minister, the Government and its predecessor to provide us with a reliable functioning health system, despite all the money spent. There have been structural, management, administrative and communications failures in recent weeks. These failures are common in the health service and are unequivocally the result of the failure of political leadership.It is not that we do not have good doctors and nurses or that health personnel, including the much maligned administrative personnel, are deficient and unmoved by the crisis over which they are forced to preside. It is a failure at the top to undertake the fundamental reforms required of the complex mesh of health services and of how they are provided and procured. This is not news to the Minister. He lectures us regularly about the need for reform. He knows the deficiencies in the health service and the financial, legal and public health problems associated with those deficiencies. While the Minister continuously makes worthy speeches about the need for reform, he seems to want to ride out his time in health without making a hard decision.We have heard about the reports which have been published. Almost every area of policy was reviewed by consultants. Some, who made the mistake of reporting too soon, were asked to review the review, while other reports gather dust on shelves. Others which require difficult decisions are not allowed to report, but seem to be condemned to be endlessly rewritten until they are so diluted they will not upset anyone and a passing approximation to reform has long since disappeared.One of the earliest reports commissioned by the Minister, the value for money report, spelled out clearly that his Department does not have the skills or the structures to implement the health strategy. Month after month we are told in reply to parliamentary questions about the number of action plans to implement the health strategy. However, the relationship between what we are told and what is happening is tenuous.Reform must start at the top. It must start with openness, transparency and the taking of responsibility. It must start by telling people unpalatable truths rather than hiding behind spin and shifting the blame. Leadership is about taking responsibility, not about playing blame games. How can reform begin when the Minister cultivates a health service which sets region against region, specialty against specialty, nurses against doctors and hospitals against health boards? The system forces medical specialists into public relations campaigns against each other to compete for funding. Everyone in the system is to blame, except the Minister. The Minister tried again this morning to set one region against another. He tried to set the good little boys in the hospitals outside Dublin against the bad little boys in the hospitals in Dublin. However, the health cutbacks will affect the entire country, not just the Dublin teaching hospitals.Every week during Question Time the Minister is unable to accept responsibility. We are always told the responsibility lies somewhere else, such as with the health boards, the GMS or the Health Service Employers' Agency. If we are not told that, we are told about the health strategy as if that bore some relation to reality. The Department is more interested in public relations policies than in health policies.On 20 November last, during the Estimates debate, the Minister said that the increase of €694 million represents a 9% increase in year-on-year current spending. He further stated, "This demonstrates more than anything else the Government's commitment to the health services and our determination to protect them and resource them adequately, even in an economically tougher year than we have become used to."  We should examine that. The Eastern Regional Health Authority received a determination for 2003 of €2.92 billion. That was sold as a 7.1% increase on the spending for 2002. However, it was a 2.7% increase on the outturn for 2002. The ERHA needed €285 million to stand still, without developing new services. However, it received €81 million.I heard the Minister's interview in Brussels last night. He said he had heard such announcements about cutbacks before and that they were not serious. He said cutbacks had not occurred and that is was scaremongering. It is not scaremongering. In the debate last November when the Minister announced the Estimates for this year, I predicted savage cutbacks in the acute hospitals because I knew that the 9% increase was not an honest reflection of what was happening. Basing budgets on what was supposed to happen in the health service last year rather than on what actually happened, is a farce. I heard the Minister trying to defend it today. The teaching hospitals in Dublin required €87 million to stand still, but they received only €200,000. It should not come as a surprise to the Minister that there are cutbacks. It is hard to believe that the Minister continues to deny it. Are things so bad that the Minister does not know what is happening?I asked six weeks ago for details of the hospital budgets for 2003 compared with 2002. The Minister's response in a parliamentary question was that he did not have that information. How can that be possible? How can the House accept that the Minister for Health and Children does not know the hospital budgets? Again, the Minister tried to blame the Dublin hospitals as if they were deficient in some way. The reality is that these cutbacks will affect the entire country. The South Eastern Health Board region needed an extra €23 million just to stand still in terms of the services it was providing; it got €6 million. If you live in the West there is also bad news despite what the Minister said; that health board received €5 million less this year than last year.What these hospitals planned to spend last year is irrelevant. We can only judge by what they actually spent. Unfortunately, people cannot regulate their health to suit the Minister for Finance. During the Estimates debate the Minister said: "It is the first time in 20 years that we have had any kind of concerted increase in hospital beds in the public sector."  The Minister continued to indulge in that flight of fancy this afternoon. When I disagreed and predicted bed closures he said he could not accept those predictions. As for the Minister's increase in beds, last year the ERHA region opened 265 beds, as the Minister proclaimed proudly some months ago, but forecasts suggest yesterday's budget cuts will close 250 beds. That means that in reality 15 beds were opened. Of course the Minister ringfenced new beds, but he ringfenced them from the budget for the old beds. Where is the sense in this budgeting, which makes neither sense nor savings?We did not quite appreciate the Minister's irony during the Estimates debate in November 2003 when he said: "The year 2003 will be a significant year in terms of structural change."  The structure is falling apart.The public saw the handling of SARS as symptomatic of the deeper malaise in the health service. If so, the handling of the public health doctors dispute was a manifestation of a very deep malaise in the health sector. On the one hand, the Minister professes to place great importance on disease prevention and health promotion. He knows that unless that shift in emphasis takes place that the demands on the health service will rapidly become unsustainable, if they have not become so already. He knows too that public health doctors are crucial to prevention and that not only is prevention far preferable to cure from the public's point of view, but these doctors are the only group of doctors in the entire health system who can save him money. The reason for the existence of public health doctors is to prevent disease and, consequently, reduce the need for treatment, saving the Minister money.The Minister is spending €9 billion annually and is desperate for savings, but he allows a problem to fester for nine years with the one group which could help him. When the issue came to a head against a background of a new emerging disease and the Special Olympics, he came to the Dáil to insult the members of that group and, in case they did not hear him, he went to their conference and insulted them again.I hope we have learned that disease knows no timetable and that disease control can no longer knock off at 5 p.m. on a Friday evening. I ask the Minister to take the public health doctors' dispute seriously and to show them the courtesy of expressing concern about the issue. He should inform the Labour Relations Commission that he is serious, that he is willing to go there to solve the dispute and that proposals will be put forward for discussion. What has been going on so far is a disgrace, with officials turning up who do not know what the issues are. This involves people, largely women, who do not deserve the disdain with which they are being treated. We need them.Members of the public depend on the Government to protect them; that is why they elect it. Specifically, they depend on the Minister for Health to protect their health, but they have lost confidence in the Minister's ability to do so. As a result the Special Olympics, instead of the joyous event it should be, has become a focus of great concern for participants and host towns. Thousands of people around the world and in Ireland have put enormous energy, time and hope into the games. It would be a travesty and a tragedy if anything were to happen to jeopardise an event into which so many have invested so much. The Minister must demonstrate beyond all doubt that he can and will protect our health and the health of 40,000 visitors coming for the games, the vast majority of whom come from countries not affected by SARS.In this, as in all aspects of the health service, perception is very important. Restoring public confidence is essential and to do so, the public must believe that someone is in charge, someone who knows what he is doing, someone who is competent, someone who will look out for their best interests and someone who is capable of protecting them. The current perception is that the Minister cannot do so.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I refer to the Department of Health and Children's website statement on what is being done to prevent SARS from entering Ireland: "An action plan for dealing with the SARS issue has been in place since mid-March."An article in The Irish Times of 26 April, almost six weeks later, stated:In the early hours of last Wednesday morning outside the GPO in Dublin's O'Connell Street . . .  a car, which had been slowly cruising the streets of the capital for a number of hours, screeched to a halt. Three masked women jumped out and pursued two Chinese women, who moved away anxiously. After a few minutes, the visibly frightened Chinese women agreed to put on face masks and accompany the Irish women back to their car. All five drove off in the direction of Cherry Orchard Hospital. The three women cruising the streets of Dublin were senior public health doctors from the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Although on strike for 10 days, they had decided to try to find a Chinese woman who had gone missing from SARS quarantine late on Tuesday night. They eventually found the Chinese national and her sister in front of the GPO.Welcome to communicable disease management, Irish-style. Such Keystone Cops-type antics won't be found in the World Health Organisation manual of best practice for dealing with emergencies. However . . .  [it] is likely to find its way into future training notes as an extreme example of how not to manage a potential infectious disease epidemic.In February 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome was recognised as a threat to public health by the World Health Organisation. On 12 March the same organisation issued a global alert about cases of atypical pneumonia occurring in some far eastern countries. As of yesterday, there were 6,727 cases worldwide and 478 deaths from the disease.The SARS outbreak has had a cataclysmic effect in areas of high infection. It has affected individuals, economies and travel and has ended lives. Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation stated on the "Six O'Clock News" that 14% to 15% of those infected die, and 45% to 55% of those infected over 60 die. SARS has separated families and put a strain on health facilities and health professionals. It has had a cataclysmic effect in this country also, though not because the disease is widespread – we had one probable case, now thankfully recovered – but because the management and handling of the possibility of an outbreak of SARS has exposed yet again the irresponsibility, incompetence, mismanagement, ineptitude and dishonesty which are the hallmarks of this Minister and Government.The whole SARS episode to date is an ongoing catalogue of disaster. From the date of first alert by the WHO in March of this year, the director of the NDSC alerted health professionals and the Department of Health and Children of the possible risk. This action continued over the following weekend. The public health doctors, whose expertise in the area of infectious disease is a prerequisite for success, carried out their mandate with impeccable correctness. On 11 April, in the midst of the global epidemic, in a dispute which has dragged on for more than nine years, the Minister for Health and Children forced public health doctors on to the streets. He deprived himself and the public of their skills, knowledge and expertise. To ensure they would not return to work, he insulted them in the Dáil and, as Deputy Olivia Mitchell said, then went to Tralee to add insult to injury. It was all down hill from then on.If the Minister wanted to solve the industrial dispute, attacking the officials was the worst way to go. I was involved in frontline industrial relations for 15 years and was on the Employment Appeals Tribunal for nine years. If one wants to bring a strike to a head and is prepared to close down the shop, one takes on those on strike head-on. If one wishes to sort out the problem and to get back on the road as quickly as possible one works in the background to resolve the matter. The Minister was prepared to close down the shop in any interpretation of industrial relations practice.Concern was expressed here about SARS. People were interested and a little worried and needed reassurance that somebody was taking care of things, but they were to be disappointed. In times of concern or threat, people will listen to authority figures if they are convinced a plan is being followed. The best example of this was the behaviour of people during the foot and mouth outbreak. What rapidly became clear at that time was that there was a plan and that somebody was in charge. People responded positively to that plan. It is clear that in this case there is no plan despite the Minister's website statement. The Minister was more interested in public relations than public health, more spin than care. The gaping black hole of Government ineptitude opened beneath our feet. What followed was panic and the "what if" syndrome which characterises situations where there is no leadership. What fuelled the fire was the worst-case scenario imagery in the headlines of our newspapers, in contributions to chat shows, in pubs and workplaces. What started out as media and public concern ended up as consternation.From one day to the next, we had no idea what the Government was doing. We know expert groups were set up and that they met – we had press releases from the Department of Health and Children telling us so. We had media interviews with the Minister, full of concern, but with no idea, no plan and no action. There was confusion about the treatment of a suspect case of SARS. There was further confusion about whether the case had become probable or suspect. The Minister told us that the patient had been given the all clear. There was relief all round. Then it became clear, or at least less unclear, that the patient was not out of the woods. The Minister's anxiety to be associated with good news was misguided. The situation worsened when on 24 April, ten days after the public health doctors began their strike, the chief medical officer and the Eastern Regional Health Authority flatly contradicted each other about disease categorisation. As the ERHA and the CMO are supposed to be arms of the same organisation, the health service, such dysfunctional miscommunication became as serious in the public eye as a misdiagnosis of the disease. The chaos was exposed. The Minister did not know one part of his anatomy from the other. This was bad publicity and the publicity fightback began.To read the Department of Health and Children website is a treat in itself. There is a banner headline on SARS with the date of update emblazoned across it and there is a link to information. The first line states that an action plan has been in place since mid-March. If that is so, where is it? There has been no plan, and certainly no action, for weeks. Had there been evidence of a plan in airports, ferry ports hospitals and GP surgeries, there would have been less panic and less concern. Now, we are bombarded with information, all backdated. Revisionism is a blessing for the Government. It has become a way of life for it.I will refer now to the Special Olympics World Games and in particular a statement made at approximately 6.26 p.m. this evening by Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Authority.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate and to thank Deputy Olivia Mitchell for tabling this motion. Some 270 public health doctors, the majority of them women, are earning a fraction of the salaries earned by their peers. There are currently no negotiations taking place between the Department of Health and Children and public health doctors. The IMO and the HSEA went to the Labour Relations Commission but there was no move from the HSEA or the Department of Health and Children. The Minister said "No".This dispute dates back to 1994 following a review. That review, which took nine years, was completed last year. Last October, public health doctors were informed by the Department of Health and Children that proposals would be on the table within six weeks. To date, they have not seen any proposals. The Minister now claims the report is out of date. So much for value for money. We hear ad nauseam about value for money. The Minister pays lip service to it but we see no action. There is nothing on prevention which, as Deputy Olivia Mitchell said earlier, saves money. That is one way of saving money within the health service.The public health doctors dispute is a symptom of the extent to which our health system under-values prevention and the breakdown within the health system. The work of public health doctors ranges from controlling the spread of infectious diseases such as SARS, meningitis and salmonella to the prevention through vaccination of tuberculosis and measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccination programme operated by the Department of Health and Children is a disaster. There is no public confidence in it. The uptake of the MMR vaccine is almost 25% below the targets set.The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, expressed concern at the low uptake and urged parents to have their children immunised. What action has been taken in that regard? In 2000, a measles outbreak cost the lives of three children. This is evidence of what happens when there is a fall-off in immunisation rates. There is great fear in relation to the MMR vaccination and autism. Parents are not provided with adequate information in that regard. Public health doctors are crucially important in providing basic information allowing parents to make a conscious decision to have their children vaccinated. The cost of infectious diseases is astronomical. Bacterial meningitis is an extremely serious disease and can be successfully treated with antibiotics if detected early. There were 515 cases and 30 deaths from bacterial meningitis in 2000. Some 15% of those who survived are left with disabilities such as blindness, deafness, limb amputations and behavioural problems. That costs at least €75 million per annum, which is approximately the cost of 300 acute beds – that is the crisis in the Dublin teaching hospitals. Where the investment is put in and where the supports are being provided by the public health doctors, there is a rebate to the State and the funds are coming back to it.In 2002, the winter vomiting bug had significant cost implications for many of the health boards, with staff accounting for one third of those who became infected. It cost the Western Health Board €1 million. The outbreak resulted in a serious disruption of some hospitals, which had to cancel elective surgery. So much for addressing waiting lists in two years. The public health doctors are at the coalface of prevention measures and ensuring that diseases do not spread, yet the Minister is not prepared to negotiate with them and has put no proposals on the table to date.Public health doctors are responsible for the planning and implementation of prevention and awareness programmes such as those for heart disease and diabetes. Type two diabetes costs €461.8 million per annum, or 6% of the total health care budget. That is the cost of approximately 1,850 acute hospital beds. Any saving would be beneficial to the health service. Hospitalisation accounts for nearly 50% of that spending. Early diagnosis and the appropriate management of type two diabetes will prevent or delay the onset of serious complications such as a heart attack or stroke, and eye and kidney complaints. One in every two people with diabetes do not even know they have it. Public health doctors have a responsibility to make the public aware of this and in making people who have diabetes aware they are sufferers, yet we see the Minister in dispute with them and no proposals on the table.These, and many other diseases, cost taxpayers and the economy millions of euro every year, and put significant pressures on the health services. The Minister for Health and Children is turning his back on prevention and controls. However, lives are saved by public health work. This is real life-saving, and more are saved in this way than in operating theatres.The Government's health strategy places major emphasis on preventing death and suffering and promoting positive health. That health strategy is now gone out the window, even though the ink is hardly dry on it. The Minister used the health strategy at the general election to pull the wool over the eyes of the electorate and for spin and PR, but it has now gone into the bin.As my colleague, Deputy Neville, stated, there is no contingency plan in place to deal with SARS. It reminds me of the iodine tablet fiasco the year before last. The reason for the problem in Clonmel is there is a fear of SARS among the public and the information has not been provided. It will damage the Special Olympics, the only positive tourism development which will happen in Ireland this year.No one appreciates the work of public health doctors until something goes wrong – until there is an infectious disease outbreak. Modern medicine relies heavily on up-to-date advice provided through networks of health doctors about cases of measles and meningitis which break out locally to ensure that vaccination takes place. New infectious diseases with high mortality rates need to be monitored by the experts and, in turn, that information needs to be provided to GPs in a swift and prompt manner. Public health doctors are essential to the investigation and control of infectious diseases and the Government's lack of commitment to put in place an out of hours system for surveillance and control of infectious diseases is making a sham of the system.There are approximately 40 infectious diseases notifiable by law. These include SARS, meningitis and hepatitis, but there is no out of hours service in place at present and this is a serious concern for everyone. For example, e.coli 0157, one of the more serious food borne illnesses, is dangerous if a child, an elderly person or someone who is immune-suppressed becomes infected. The majority of major infections occur at weekend functions such as weddings and all the serious outbreaks have taken place over weekends. However, there are no back-up services in place.In 2001, there were 5,923 infectious disease cases reported. There is not even an out of hours telephone number to contact public health doctors and the other individuals involved in providing back-up services. That basic element is not even in place. Our out of hours service is a sham, our infectious diseases policy is a sham and there is no one to cover infectious diseases at the weekend. It is by the grace of God that we have not had a catastrophe in this country, and the Minister is turning his back on this and is not prepared to put any proposal on the table to address this issue.One of the other roles of public health doctors is the co-ordination of services for older people and people with physical and sensory disabilities. This is an important service. Without it, there will be significant problems within the health service. The Minister has talked about the number of elderly people in acute hospital beds who should not be there. They need to be released into the community or into other hospitals, but they are putting pressure on acute and geriatric services because the structures and supports have not been put in place. They have not been put in place because public health doctors have not been given the resources and they are not being put in place at present. The hospitals, therefore, are delaying the release of those patients and that is putting pressure on acute hospital services.The Minister talks of reform. Public health doctors are crucially important and are key to any reform of the health service. As Deputy Olivia Mitchell said, prevention is better than cure. However, the Minister has taken no action or decisions on reform and we are still waiting to see what proposals, if any, he will put on the table in the industrial dispute with public health doctors.If a health care worker in a maternity hospital had an infection such as hepatitis or HIV, public health doctors would have to go and trace that worker. A patient treated by such a care worker would like to know about it as swiftly as possible, but the resources are not being put in place and the Minister is not prepared to put an out of hours service in place.It is about time the Minister resolved this dispute. Nine years is long enough for it to go on. It is about time it was resolved and that an adequate 24-hour, seven day a week service was put in place. The fact that the industrial action is taking place and the difficulties with SARS exposes what has been bubbling under the surface for years. As I said, we are blessed that we have not had a catastrophe to date.I want to focus on something Deputy Olivia Mitchell spoke about earlier, namely, the cutbacks in the Western Health Board where €5 million less has been provided in 2003. There is the ludicrous situation in the Western Health Board where we will pay staff and will maintain our hospital beds, but we cannot afford to put patients into these beds. The only way we can put patients into them is to tender for the treatment purchase fund. We must go back to the Department tendering for the treatment purchase fund so that we can put patients into the beds, even though the staff will be paid and the hospital beds have to be maintained.

We cannot treat our own patients, but we could be treating patients from Waterford and Limerick, for example, while our own patients remain on the waiting lists for elective procedures. That situation has not been addressed. That is the sham in the public health service. It is a crazy system where we are paying doctors and staff, yet we must keep beds closed because we cannot afford to put patients into them.Our accident and emergency units in small hospitals are under threat. There is a question mark over them. Only last year the Department of Health and Children invested in a new accident and emergency facility in my county hospital in Roscommon, which is under construction at present and which is costing nearly €10 million. I welcome that investment, but we have not received a commitment regarding the long-term future of that accident and emergency unit. That is a crazy system of planning and it is typical of what is going on.The accident and emergency unit in Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe has a massive catchment area. We do not even have a 24-hour ambulance service covering a large geographic area. That is the type of system in place. It is breaking down on a day-to-day basis. It is about time the Minister took action.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:– endorses the speedy and comprehensive response by the Minister for Health and Children to the threat of SARS which is fully in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines and endorsed by them, including in particular:– the prompt and ongoing public information campaign alerting members of the public to the signs and symptoms, causes and transmission modes of SARS and travel advisories in relation to travel to and from affected areas;– the detailed guidance provided to health professionals in relation to the diagnosis, clinical management, surveillance and contact tracing for suspect and probable SARS cases and to airline crew and cleaning staff in relation to the possible in-flight care and follow-up procedures for a suspect case of SARS;– the comprehensive operational framework established to provide an integrated public service wide response, comprising:– an expert committee– an interdepartmental planning group– a health service implementation group, and– a communications group;– acknowledges the Minister's efforts to resolve the public health doctors dispute within the framework of public sector pay policy, in particular the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, and calls on the Irish Medical Organisation to continue talks with a view to resolving the dispute having regard to the serious threat posed by infectious diseases, including SARS;and– notes the intention of the Minister for Health and Children to bring proposals to Government shortly for the reform of the health services.I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the issue of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, which has been the subject of much commentary and analysis in both the general and specialist health media in recent times. I intend to confine myself to the subject matter of the motion tabled by Deputy Olivia Mitchell and her colleagues. If Deputies wanted to discuss other issues, they should have been encompassed specifically in the motion before us.I am somewhat disappointed by the tone and tenor of the content of the debate so far. In their contributions, members of the Opposition have demonstrated a level of political opportunity that represents a new low in cynicism and delusion.

I would like to present a brief overview of SARS and why it has become such a topic of worldwide public concern.Severe acute respiratory syndrome is an acute respiratory illness of unknown origin, which was first recognised in south-east Asia in February 2003. Owing to the serious nature of the infection, its high mortality and its spread to a number of different countries, it was declared a threat to international health by the director general of the World Health Organisation in March 2003. As part of its worldwide surveillance of the syndrome, the World Health Organisation has requested member states to provide information on their experience. As of 5 May 2003, a cumulative total of 6,583 "probable" SARS cases with 461 deaths have been reported from 29 countries to the World Health Organisation. To date, Ireland, in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, has confirmed to that organisation that it has one "probable" case, reported many weeks ago. One probable case does not justify the invective and hyperbole that we have heard this evening.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	490	In the case of the iodine tablets, we had no nuclear accident.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The 15 EU countries between them have 32 "probable" cases with no deaths. Our nearest neighbour, the UK, has six "probable" cases. Areas of Asia account for the vast majority of cases and deaths. Outside this area, Canada has been most affected. The World Health Organisation has been quite assertive on this issue, saying that its fundamental advice, which we took on board at a very early stage, has been the principal factor for the curtailment of the spread of SARS in areas outside Asia. Those are not my words. That is the consistent position of the World Health Organisation as expressed personally to me by its officials and yesterday to the European Union Council of Health Ministers by the director general of the WHO.The symptoms of SARS include high temperature and dry cough and-or shortness of breath and-or difficulty breathing. This is relevant only to people who have been in the affected areas and-or have had, during the ten days prior to onset of symptoms, close contact with a person who is a suspect or probable case of SARS.As the WHO itself recognises, the case definitions, which it has provided to member states to assist in global surveillance, are subject to limitations due to the evolving nature of the illness. They are based on current understanding of the clinical features of the disease and the available epidemiological data, and may be revised. It also makes allowance for the fact that countries may need to adapt the definitions to their own disease situation.To understand this issue, it is worthwhile for me to set out clearly on record the case definitions for SARS. A suspect case is a person presenting after 1 November 2002 with history of high fever and cough or breathing difficulty and one or more of the following exposures during the ten days prior to onset of symptoms: close contact with a person who is a suspect or probable case of SARS; history of travel to an affected area; and residing in an affected area. A suspect case may also be a person with an unexplained acute respiratory illness resulting in death after 1 November 2002 but on whom no autopsy has been performed and one or more of the following exposures during the ten days prior to the onset of symptoms: close contact with a person who is a suspect or probable case of SARS; history of travel to an affected area; and residing in an affected area.A probable case is a suspect case with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome, RDS, on chest X-ray or a suspect case with autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of respiratory distress syndrome without an identifiable cause.While there was considerable media coverage in relation to the change in status between a "suspect" and "probable" case, the World Health Organisation's guidelines indicate that because there is no diagnostic test for the virus, SARS is currently a diagnosis of exclusion and that the status of a reported case may change over time. In its documentation, it describes a number of scenarios in which this process could occur.Examples given include: a suspect case who, after investigation, fulfils the probable case definition, should be reclassified as "probable" and a case initially classified as suspect or probable for whom an alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness should be discarded. That happened prior to the incident mentioned by Deputy Neville but nobody took a blind bit of notice at the time. Even when we reported our first probable case, nobody took any great notice even though we issued public statements to that effect. It was reported in the media, but everybody was interested in the war in Iraq at the time.The existence of SARS was first brought to the attention of the Irish authorities during the week ending 16 March 2003. The early advice from the World Health Organisation was merely to provide information about the new condition to the relevant authorities. When the existence and possible implications of this condition were first identified internationally in March 2003 the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, following consultation with my Department, issued an alert to all directors of public health on 14 March 2003, which represented a very quick response at the time.Contrary to reports, my Department moved immediately to respond to the threat of SARS to Ireland. Medical staff from my Department in collaboration with the NDSC spent St. Patrick's weekend making the appropriate international contacts and literature searches to fully assess these factors and, having done so, put in place the initial comprehensive public information and the key issue of professional guidance which has been the basis for our approach to this issue since. This approach has been effective in curtailing the spread of SARS.I wish to pay tribute to our people in the medical division of the Department under our chief medical officer who gave up their St. Patrick's weekend with the director of the NDSC and its staff to work up these guidelines days after the alert from the World Health Organisation. It is not good enough to hear such terms as "ineptitude", "shambolic" and the kind of invective we have heard this evening from the Opposition when the evidence is there that people in my Department and in the medical division in my Department from very early on worked quickly to develop comprehensive, professional guidelines for the professionals over the St. Patrick's bank holiday weekend. I wish to put this on the record of the House. I pay a warm tribute to those officials who gave good service to the public in the discharge of their duties.On receipt of the initial report of the situation following St. Patrick's Day – over seven weeks ago – I established an expert group under the chairmanship of Dr. Darina O'Flanagan to advise me on the issue and to make recommendations as to what actions would be appropriate to prevent the establishment and spread of SARS in Ireland. The group monitors the situation as it develops and provides advice regarding the measures required to deal with the syndrome. The group includes representatives of my Department, the health boards and the various clinical disciplines appropriate to the task. This group, which is currently chaired by Dr. Jim Kiely, chief medical officer of my Department, has met 14 times to date and continues to meet twice weekly.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	495	The deliberations and recommendations of the group are based on a number of sound, well-tried infectious disease surveillance, control and prevention principles which are internationally accepted and are exemplified in the guidance on this issue published by the WHO, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA and a number of other reputable international public health institutes including the NDSC. These include: accurate, well-informed and easily readable public information; sound practical preventative measures including such basic measures as good hand washing; early identification of cases; effective clinical care including good hospital infection control; effective follow-up and management of contacts; rational travel advice for people travelling to and from areas which are affected by SARS; and legal effect to recommended measures including the designation of SARS as a notifiable disease.Experts from the WHO have fully endorsed the measures which we have put in place to prevent the establishment and spread of SARS in Ireland. Yesterday on the BBC World Service – to which I know not everybody might be listening – Ireland and the UK were singled out for having managed the situation well by a different spokesperson from the World Health Organisation.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	500	—is at great variance with the political commentary we are receiving here which has more to do with political issues than with the reality of the situation. On the basis of advice from the expert group, the following information and guidance, which is then disseminated through the system for use by health professionals and management staff, has been developed: protocols and guidance for hospitals and health professionals which describe the syndrome and provide advice on how cases should be clinically diagnosed and managed have been developed and widely disseminated; guidance for laboratory and infection control staff is now in use, as is information and guidance for aircraft cabin and aircraft cleaning staff; and travel advisories have been given regarding travel to and from affected areas. Essentially the advice is not to travel to an affected area and persons travelling from an affected area are advised to monitor their health for ten days following their return. If they develop any of the symptoms they should seek medical advice urgently and advise the relevant medical practitioner that they have recently been in an affected area. Advertisements to this effect have been prominently displayed in the national newspapers on a number of occasions since the end of March last. Specific travel advice has also been developed for health care workers.Since the incubation period of SARS can be up to ten days, general registration or health controls, that is, screening at ports of arrival in Ireland, are of little value. On the contrary, they may give the public a false sense of security. This is in line with expert advice received from the World Health Organisation and the European Union communicable diseases committee which I can make available to Deputies. Instead, the WHO recommends that persons departing an affected area should be interviewed by a health worker to assess whether they have any of the symptoms of SARS or have had any contact with a probable or suspect case. That issue about the incubation period is important in terms of screening when people present. It was interesting to hear yesterday at the Council of Health Ministers that the vast majority of the exported cases into Europe would have been well on both departure from the area where the infection was acquired and on arrival at their destination. However, there was much hysteria about two weeks ago in regard to the lack of screening at our airports and a lot of ill-informed comment. There are issues around that which we can debate in a balanced and sensible way but these are the facts.Recommendations have been made as to the nature of the public information which should be made available. Arrangements have been put in place to give effect to this and early in the process, information was made available by way of notices in airports to alert travellers to the issue. This effort was expanded recently and, with effect from Monday, 28 April 2003, arrangements were made to hand out information leaflets on all incoming flights to Ireland and at other points of entry – ports and the Enterprise train line. It is estimated that some 100,000 leaflets per day will be distributed through these channels. Public announcements are also being made on incoming flights and ferries. SARS information desks have been set up at arrival terminals in all airports and ferry ports. A national free phone line, 1800 45 45 00, has been set up with effect from 28 April. Full information is available on my Department's website which is updated daily. Consideration is also being given by the expert group to the issue of the public health implications of participation by a number of countries in the Special Olympics. It is anticipated that a decision will be taken by mid-May and I await the advice from the expert group in that regard.My Department has produced a detailed frequently asked questions document which, in addition to being available on my Department's website, has been circulated to other health agencies and organisations, including trade unions, educational institutions, professional bodies, etc., for circulation and display on their websites.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	501	The most frequently asked question is: "Who is in charge?"
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	502	In addition, I have ensured that an organisational framework with clear lines of responsibility and whose function is to ensure that the recommendations of the expert group are implemented in their entirety has now been developed within my Department and includes the following: an interdepartmental planning group which is responsible for co-ordinating the measures needed in other areas of public policy or public services to support the protection of public health; feeding back on the ongoing effectiveness of measures taken; and considering, in light of SARS development nationally and internationally, any further measures required.In addition, there is now a health service implementation group which consists of senior management of my Department and the chief executive officers of the health boards which is responsible for ensuring a full response by all aspects of the health system to the SARS threat including: arrangements for treatment of SARS cases, both in hospital and the community, including appropriate surveillance; an adequate public information and advisory service locally; adequate protection of health service staff; staffing of information points at airports and relevant ports; a system for notification of potential cases and prompt follow-up of contacts; arrangements for isolation and quarantine where necessary; and prompt information flow to the incident room in my Department.Furthermore, a communications group, which is led by the press office of my Department in liaison with the Government Information Service, GIS, and communication officers of each health board, is responsible for co-ordinating all communications relating to SARS, including information to the public, statements to media and daily press briefings.We must recognise that SARS is a new and unpredictable condition. While the spread of the disease has been facilitated by rapid international travel, the actions of the WHO have allowed a remarkably rapid identification of the features of the syndrome, its causative organism, rapid progress towards the elaboration of a reliable diagnostic test and the implementation of a series of public health measures which have allowed for the control of the outbreak in a number of countries in which it was established and prevention of its wider spread. However, the continuation of the outbreak in the most populous country on earth gives serious cause for concern. It emphasises the need for continuous vigilance and for the effective implementation of the public health measures which have so far allowed countries in the European Union, including Ireland, to control the outbreak. We are determined to continue to draw upon the most up-to-date international and national information and expertise to inform our approach to this disease, to collaborate with our EU and WHO partner member states in the fight against SARS and to maintain a state of readiness to deal with the illness as it evolves.Of course the public health doctors dispute has hampered our response to the SARS threat. I have been consistent about that from the word go. In response to this, the Department, together with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and each health board, have put emergency contingency plans in place to enable them to provide an emergency response to infectious disease outbreaks, including SARS, during the course of the strike. These plans include: the establishment of a national network of senior co-ordinators at health board level – the co-ordinators monitor the contingency plans and report on suspect cases throughout the country; the establishment of an incident room with a dedicated national call number in the Department of Health and Children – staff are available at all times to deal with issues that may arise in health boards and reports on queries that may arise are issued twice daily from health boards to the incident room; and ensuring that the country's experts in virology, respiratory infections and infectious diseases are available to advise and assist in the diagnosis and treatment of suspected SARS cases. Although less than optimal, I am satisfied the contingency plans have enabled an adequate response to the diagnosis and treatment of suspect SARS cases.I now turn to the strike by public health doctors, who are members of the Irish Medical Organisation. A national strike by any group of health care workers will always have implications for our health service. I value the important contribution made by public health doctors to the health services, particularly in relation to population health and preventative medicine. I have worked very well with public health doctors since I became Minister for Health and Children on a wide range of campaigns and issues. However, I wish to state again, on my own behalf and that of the Government, our serious concern at the national strike action by public health doctors in pursuit of a 30% pay claim.Groups of staff at every level right across the health system enter claims about a variety of issues related to their terms and conditions of employment. If my job as Minister for Health and Children, or my Department's role, was to simply say "Yes" to each of these claims and demands, not only the health system but the entire country would be bankrupt in no time. There are general frameworks – for example, the various pay agreements – within which any such claims have to be examined and considered. There is also the formal industrial relations machinery through which valid claims must be processed. It is simply not within my power or that of my Department or the HSEA or any other agent of management to simply concede major pay claims just because they have been demanded. That would be the easiest thing in the world to do and that is what the Opposition seems to be suggesting we should do.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	507	As a general rule, I do not parrot. Such a scenario as I have just outlined does not apply to any group in the health system or the wider public services. We just cannot say "Yes" to every demand which comes forward. That is simply common sense. This claim has been lodged in relation to the current duties and responsibilities of these doctors and is separate to any pay increase the Irish Medical Organisation has indicated it will demand for the implementation of changed working practices that may be required in the future. It is important to clarify again the background to the current dispute, especially in view of the ongoing variety of selective historical accounts being circulated, some of which we have heard again this evening.I remind the House of the offer that has been made to the public health doctors and rejected by them. This substantial pay increase would be on top of the increases which fall to be paid under the report of the public service benchmarking body and before the payment of moneys which will arise from the new national wage agreement, Sustaining Progress. The regional public health function was established in 1994, comprising the grades of director of public health, specialist in public health, senior area medical officers and area medical officers. Much coverage has been given to the suggestion that nine years or more have elapsed without the issues at the heart of this dispute being addressed. This suggestion is factually incorrect. Under the original 1994 agreement in relation to the establishment of new departments of public health, it was agreed that a review would be undertaken within two years of the departments getting up and running. This process took longer than expected, which in turn delayed the establishment of the primary health review group until 1999.The report of the public health review group, the Brennan report, which, through no fault of the parties involved, took longer to complete than anticipated, was published in April 2002. Discussions, both formal and informal, have taken place with the IMO in the interim, though as yet without agreement. In relation to the full review of the public health function, which commenced in 1999, the IMO was an equal partner and co-owner of this review process. The HSEA, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards accept the recommendations contained in the Brennan report. The report, however, reflects the diverging views between the parties on the issue of consultant status for public health doctors. The chairman's comments on the status of directors and specialists were no more than a personal view and, as such, had not the status of a recommendation. The only recommendations contained in the report were on those issues on which the parties were in agreement.It is important to note that the Brennan report acknowledged there might be a need to revisit its recommendations following the implementation of proposed changes recommended by the health strategy and the primary care strategy. Both of these strategies and the forthcoming report on the audit of structures in the health service and the report of the commission on financial management and control in the health services, will have significant implications for the future role of public health doctors and, as such, must be taken fully into account in any negotiations process.I have already mentioned the payments which fall due to public health doctors, arising from the benchmarking body and I now wish to refer to this matter in more detail. In 2002, following extensive consideration of a detailed submission by the IMO, the public service benchmarking body recommended increases for public health doctors, ranging from 2.5% for specialists in public health medicine to 14.2% for directors of public health medicine. In making these recommendations, the benchmarking body was determining the rate of pay which should apply to the various public health posts, based on their duties and responsibilities as of 30 June 2002. It is also important to note that these duties and responsibilities have not changed in the interim. The benchmarking body acknowledged that it was not in a position to take account of the issues raised by the public health review group. In this regard, the health strategy envisages a population health division being established in each health board, incorporating such areas as public health and health promotion units. These developments will obviously be influenced by the outcome of the restructuring proposals which are currently being finalised and must be central to any consideration of the future role and responsibilities of public health doctors.Once again, it is necessary to clarify and reiterate the pay increases that have been offered to public health doctors, based on their current role and responsibilities, to resolve the key issues at the heart of this industrial relations dispute. On 14 March at informal talks in the Labour Relations Commission, management made an offer of 10.5%, excluding benchmarking, through the independent chair. This offer was confirmed in writing by the HSEA on 18 March. Taking into account the increases awarded to public health doctors under benchmarking and the Sustaining Progress national agreement, the application of this increase would result in the following increases for public health doctors between now and 2005, when the Sustaining Progress agreement ends. Directors of public health would receive an increase of €29,000, or 35.39%, bringing them to €111,000 per annum. Public health specialists would receive an increase of €17,000, or 21.52%, bringing them to €95,000 per annum. Senior area medical officers would receive an increase of between €17,000 and €19,000, or 30.41%, bringing them to between €71,000 and €81,000 per annum. Area medical officers would receive an increase between €11,000 and €13,000, or 22%, bringing them to between €59,000 and €69,000 per annum.The HSEA also requested the IMO to agree to have all outstanding issues referred to the Labour Court. Unfortunately, the IMO did not agree to this request and the strike started on 14 April. On 17 April, I wrote to the IMO requesting that it return to the negotiating table. On 22 April, I again wrote to the IMO confirming the availability of the HSEA and my Department to re-enter discussions with the IMO on the four specific issues identified as being in dispute. On 23 April I invited a delegation from the IMO to meet me. Although it was not possible for the IMO to accept this invitation, I had a telephone discussion with the IMO president on that day. On 24 April, the national implementation body urged the IMO to suspend its strike and avail of the industrial relations mechanisms, in accordance with the conditions of the Sustaining Progress national programme. That was rejected, almost summarily, by the IMO. On 25 April, I had an informal discussion with the president and chief executive of the IMO at their annual conference in Killarney, following my address to that conference.I have given those details to demonstrate to the House that it is untrue to claim that nothing has been done or that we have not made every possible effort to bring this dispute to a resolution. The IMO agreed on 30 April to enter into exploratory talks in the Labour Relations Commission with the HSEA and my Department. Those talks took place on 1 May and management indicated its willingness to discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the public health review group, including the development of a structured out-of-hours system. In addition, the increase of 10.5% to which I have referred was again offered. During these talks, management stressed that the issue of granting consultant status to directors and specialists was not the subject of a recommendation by the group, but merely the expression of the chairman's viewpoint.I have already acknowledged on a number of occasions that the professional input made by public health doctors to the management of infectious diseases and other public health threats is significant. I have also made clear my belief that the response of the health system is significantly hampered by the absence of that input. I and my Department have done and are doing all in our power to facilitate the resumption of negotiations on outstanding issues. I again take the opportunity to appeal to the IMO to call off its industrial action and, in accordance with the terms of Sustaining Progress, participate meaningfully in negotiations under the recognised industrial relations machinery with a view to having outstanding issues resolved as speedily as possible.I now turn to the reform of the health system. The health strategy identified the issues which needed to be addressed in reforming the health system, namely, the complex structure of decision-making, roles and responsibilities within the health system, the many layers and intersecting roles, and the lack of consistency in the development of systems and the application of schemes. It concluded that while the system has served us well in many respects, there remained a need for stronger co-ordination and integration of functions and services, greater consistency in access to services and delivery of services throughout the country and greater clarity around levels of decision-making in the full range of organisations and the requirement for "whole system" effectiveness.There are three reports currently pending which will inform me and the Government in relation to the formulation of a comprehensive reform programme for the health system. These are the audit of structures and functions in the health system, the report of the national task force on medical staffing and the report of the commission on financial management and control systems in the health service being undertaken on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance. These reports are at different stages of finalisation. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has recently received the report of the commission on financial management and controls in the health service and is now considering its contents. The work of the national task force on medical staffing is at an advanced stage but has not yet been finalised. A final draft of the audit of structures and functions in the health system has been received by the steering group overseeing the project. I anticipate that this report will be submitted to me very shortly. In consultation with my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, it is my intention to propose, in due course, an integrated reform programme to the Government based on the findings and recommendations of these reports. That integrated reform programme is based on considerable consultation and detailed work. Decisions will obviously flow from that reform programme and it will be interesting to observe the Opposition's response to those when they emerge.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I welcome this debate which affords us a timely and important opportunity to focus on the crisis in our health service. At a time when strong political leadership and clear vision are required, we have a lame-duck Minister who, despite all the evidence to the contrary, keeps saying that there is no crisis, while all around him hospital wards are closing, procedures are being cancelled and patients are suffering. The Minister's claims that there is no crisis in our health service have about as much credibility as the claims made by "Comical Ali" that Iraq was winning the war.It is time for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to go. A fresh start is needed and a new Minister would be a good first step. However, the Government as a whole has to accept the blame for the failure to tackle the issues surrounding the good, fair and efficient provision of health care to those who need it. Ultimately the Taoiseach is responsible for Government policy and his lack of interest and the absence of his leadership to deliver the reforms needed in the health service have meant that the real issues have been left to fester.Had he shown the same commitment to improving the health service as he has shown to promoting the Abbotstown project there would have been a sea change in health. Had he shown the same determination that was shown in dealing with the foot and mouth disease outbreak we would see a very different picture concerning SARS.The Taoiseach said today that the Minister, Deputy Martin, is doing his best but that is exactly what is worrying people. The Minister's best is simply not good enough and the evidence is all around us. The question the Taoiseach still has to answer is what is he going to do about it.The motion refers to a serious erosion in public confidence arising from the Minister's mishandling of the public health doctors' dispute and from his Department's shambolic approach to the SARS threat, but it is about much more. It is about the current deplorable state of our health service and a Minister who promised to make things better, yet has only succeeded in making things worse.The response by the Minister to the crisis in our major hospitals is both deficient and disingenuous but, looking back over his record, should we be that surprised? Inequality has deepened during his term of office. Inefficiency has grown rather than lessened under his stewardship.The health strategy entitled, if anybody remembers, Quality and Fairness, which he initiated, drove and spent a fortune on hyping to the public, is in need of serious resuscitation. Commitments the Minister made on hospital waiting lists, fairness and efficiency are reduced to meaningless rhetoric. The health strategy included commitments to improve public health infrastructure but look where we are now.The one significant change the Minister introduced at the Taoiseach's behest, in the deal struck with the doctors, was the costly and inequitable provision of medical cards to better off over-70s. The promise made to 200,000 poorer people to give them medical cards was abandoned. It is no coincidence that there is a 90% turnout at elections among the over-70s. Inequality has deepened during the Minister's term of office and inefficiency has grown rather than lessened under his stewardship. These are the hallmarks of his tenure. It is not coincidental that the health strategy, which the Minister produced as his triumph, was published just before the general election. It was not so much a health strategy, more one about winning votes and ensuring that Fianna Fáil got elected. Over and above the health needs of our sick and suffering population, this was a strategy about winning, no matter what fraud was perpetrated or untruths and distortions disseminated.The Minister, Deputy Martin, was up there with the best of them spinning yarns about how there would be no cutbacks in health and, ultimately, no hospital waiting lists. No sooner was the election over, however, than the Minister rolled out his real agenda – immediately increasing hospital charges and community drugs charges, as well as sanctioning VHI increases. Even then he persisted in telling the public that current service levels in our hospitals would be maintained despite what were euphemistically called "adjustments" in our public finances.There is no way the Minister can stand over the comments he made, either then or now. The outcome of Government cutbacks on hospital services is inevitable and he should have owned up, instead of hiding behind statistics that were designed to bewilder. A 10% budget increase to the ERHA does not translate into sufficient funds for the hospital service. The major hospitals have, in effect, suffered a 10% reduction in funding as a direct result of Government policy.The move taken by the five Dublin academic teaching hospitals to make a joint public statement yesterday on the effects of Government cutbacks, is unprecedented. It is also providing clarity on the ongoing deterioration in essential services that is now impacting directly on patient care and patient access. That could have implications if at any point there is an outbreak of SARS in this country. While we all hope that will not happen, we have to prepare for the worst. The impossibility of coping with such an outbreak is clear. As the Minister for Agriculture and Food said so elegantly, the Minister for Health and Children does not have the luxury of a culling policy. He will have to care for patients who will be in a serious condition if SARS is brought into this country by any means.When we talk about cutbacks we are talking about patients who are already seriously ill from cancer and heart disease. They will now have their treatment delayed or even denied. The statement by the Dublin academic teaching hospitals pointed out that the reduced availability of beds will directly impact on such critical areas such as accident and emergency, where waiting times for admission are already unacceptable. High acuity scheduled admissions – the majority of which are urgent and which are already being curtailed – will also be adversely affected, with direct medical and surgical procedures. This will inevitably mean potential delays in diagnosis of medical conditions, in the performance of necessary operations, such as cancer surgery and cardio-vascular treatments, and in the treatment of the sick with consequent unnecessary morbidity because they cannot get into hospital, including disability, deformity and pain, with reduced quality of life. It further pointed out that as the hosptials embark on major reductions in their bed capacity forced on them by the funding situation, they are concerned that they are taking actions that will undermine the fabric of their services.I do not ever recall hearing senior hospital personnel, including doctors, making such a statement. It is chilling news for anyone who is suffering from a life-threatening disease and who cannot afford the comfort zone that private health insurance provides. Some 250 hospital beds – all public beds, of course – are to close over and above the 350 beds occupied by long-stay patients who are inappropriately placed. That adds up to 20% of available bed stock in Dublin hospitals and already our bed capacity is too low. The Minister committed himself to providing an additional 3,000 new beds yet this year we will see a reduction of 20% in all, if one allows for bed blocking.Some 14,000 procedures and operations will not be proceeded with. There are to be cuts in drugs, replacement equipment and staff hours, as well as a deferral of recruitment and delays in the treatment of seriously-ill cancer and heart disease patients. Rheumotology patients may be affected and even in the Children's hospital in Crumlin there are plans to close Our Lady's ward.

Given the crisis in the Dublin hospitals, it is interesting that the Minister is saying his officials met today with the ERHA to discuss the situation. Big deal, Minister, but why did the meeting only take place when the hospitals went public on the effects of the cutbacks? Why did the Minister not ensure that the budgets for hospitals would be safeguarded and ring-fenced so that patients could be looked after? That is his job and his responsibility. We have to ask why the Minister did not ensure that the measures I have mentioned were taken. Is he happy to hide behind the ERHA as long as he can avoid the flak? Is it a question of ministerial incompetence?We are debating these issues as the public health doctors' strike drags into weeks and the SARS threat becomes more menacing and frightening. An infectious disease that was thought to have a 4% death rate is now estimated to have a 20% death rate. The sequence of events that surrounded a suspected case of SARS when a person presented at a hospital in Dublin reflected an alarming degree of uncertainty and confusion. There has been no clear strategy and no real attempt to sort out the public health doctors' strike. As a result, the public health infrastructure desperately needed in the face of a new and unfamiliar disease epidemic is not in place. The absence of expertise also affects our ability to combat familiar infectious diseases such as meningitis, measles, STDs, the winter vomiting bug and legionnaire's disease. These infectious conditions require good public health measures, but such measures are not being put in place because of the ongoing strike. The public needs to know that the two parties are talking, but all we know is that they are not.The Minister used the unfortunate phrase "parroting", but that is exactly what he is doing. The same material is being presented to us yet again in relation to the strike. We all know that the strike will have to end and that the problems will have to be resolved at some point. There was a tremendous line-up at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children. The Secretary General and the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children spoke to us about how well they are doing in combating SARS. The distinct impression that was received by the members of the committee was summed up by the Secretary General, who said it is not a question of whether out-of-hours cover will be provided in future, but how it will be done. Most members of the committee took this as a signal implying that there would be some shift. When the parties met at the LRC, however, it seems that nothing happened and that the idea of progress was a chimera.We are experiencing the legacy of six years of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition Government. Nobody would argue with the Minister that investment has significantly increased, but it has happened without the vital reforms that should have gone hand in hand with capacity building. There has been a very poor return for the Government's investment. Policy in this regard is like putting oil into a clapped-out car engine – the oil pours through the system, but the engine does not run. Having failed to reform the health service to make it more fair and more efficient, the Minister for Health and Children has little to show for his term of office other than a range of new capital projects, many of which cannot be used because staff have not been allocated. Many existing facilities have been closed down because money is not available to run them. Although there is a trail of broken promises, the Minister for Health and Children is telling us that we should not be worried by how he is dealing with the SARS outbreak.We should remember that the Taoiseach promised that he would deliver major improvements in services throughout the country. The Minister, Deputy Martin, promised that waiting times would be reduced to below 12 months for adults and six months for children by the end of 2002, but 6,273 adults and 1,201 children were waiting for more than that period of time at the end of last year. We were told that no adult would wait longer than six months and no child longer than three months by the end of 2003. Last May, the Minister went further and promised that all hospital waiting lists would be eliminated in 2004. We do not know how serious the problem is at present because the Department refuses to publish the hospital waiting list figures, which are normally published in March. It is almost mid-May and we have yet to see the figures. We do not know what is going on. It is interesting that this information is being concealed.We need to see significant and continued investment in our health service. Improvements cannot be brought about on the cheap. We need to ensure that the money follows the patient and to incentivise the system to care for patients, rather than have a system where hospitals are penalised for looking after public patients, as they are now. We need to see more autonomy in our hospitals, as well as health board reform. If the Minister comes back with a decent plan, he will receive support from the Opposition benches. Any new health board system needs to be accountable, preferably by direct election. Any new hospital agency should also be accountable, as people who need to access the health service will be disempowered further if it is not. Lack of accountability will lead to greater deficiencies. Accountability and patient empowerment are the keys to providing a decent health service, but we have very little of either at present.Some political vision, bringing together all the different parts of the health service to work together, is needed if we are to overcome the fragmentation and territorial in-fighting that is endemic in the health service as it stands. We need political leadership, with the drive and commitment that any Government can deliver if it puts its mind to it. One does not have to be Superman to be Minister for Health and Children. We are encountering a failure of political leadership, however.As a resident of Bray, I welcome the Chinese delegation before the Special Olympics. I look forward to such an event. How can the Minister assure us that the dangers presented by SARS are totally under control? If he attempts to give us some reassurance, how can we believe him, bearing in mind his track record?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I had the slightly surreal experience this morning of walking through a €100 million unit in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. It is a beautiful building and the beds are made and the pillows plumped up in some of the wards. The door into the unit is locked, however, because the Minister for Health and Children, his Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Northern Area Health Board have been unable to make arrangements for the opening of this desperately needed facility. The hospital is located in Dublin 15, which is one of the fastest growing areas in Europe. There is a population of over 75,000 in Castleknock and Blanchardstown. The hospital has a huge catchment area in Counties Meath and Kildare. The project I saw today was initiated when I was Minister of State.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	515	Half of the hospital lands were sold and the rainbow Government agreed to match the funds that were received – £75 million – pound for pound. The current Government provided some additional funding to bring the total to about €96 million. Not only has the James Connolly Memorial Hospital not been opened, at a huge cost to the Exchequer, but the hospital's key rheumatology Department and its medical section were informed last Thursday that they were to lose up to 40 beds and up to 20 full-time staff on a contract basis. This is gross incompetence. The hospital is located in an area of Dublin which, thankfully and hopefully, will host the aquatic events during the Special Olympics. What incompetence leads the Government to fail to open a significant hospital structure, the funding for which was bequeathed to it by the previous Government – it added to it, quite correctly – at the height of the Celtic tiger?I wish to speak about rheumatology. Like the Taoiseach, I have worked as an accountant in many hospitals in Dublin. I will give the Minister a small piece of advice, for which he will not have to pay a fortune in consultancy fees. The rheumatology department treats many people on a day bed basis. This means that young people afflicted by various rheumatic diseases can carry on with their family and working lives at no additional cost to the State or themselves. However, the Department and the Northern Area Health Board propose to merge that department with the medical section so that those people will be put on an acute waiting list while, at the same time, this beautiful, newly equipped hospital will have millions of euro worth of equipment lying in cellophane wrappers in its corridors.I invite the Minister and the Fine Gael spokesperson on health to next week visit the hospital in Blanchardstown. It was named after James Connolly, the anniversary of whose execution is next week, on 12 May – he was executed in 1916. It was named the James Connolly Memorial Hospital by Dr. Noel Browne when he was involved in helping to create it as a sanatorium for TB treatment in the 1950s. The Minister's party, my party and other parties in this House share a common reverence for what James Connolly did. While the Minister aspires to follow in the republican tradition of Fianna Fáil, the mess that his Department and the health board have left in regard to the James Connolly Memorial Hospital is a disgrace. On next week's anniversary, I suggest that the Minister revisits the legacy of James Connolly and that he takes time out of his busy schedule to visit the hospital to see it lying empty and idle at a time of crisis in the health services.

No progress whatsoever has been made over the past five weeks since the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food dealt with this matter in the House. Unbelievable financial hardship has been visited on farmers in these five counties and, in reality, they are the meat in the sandwich. The farmers have nothing whatever to do with the rights and wrongs of this dispute.A doomsday scenario is now beginning to emerge for farmers who had been restricted because of TB and brucellosis and who, after being cleared of both diseases, were about to sell off stock which had been stockpiled all winter at huge cost, only to find that cattle identity cards would not be released because of the strike. The degree of financial hardship suffered by the farming community is unreal. Farmers who did not sell an animal for 12 months and who have gone through a nightmare winter feeding cattle they should not have are being robbed because of the costs involved.Farmers with young stock contracted to fill overseas markets for cattle under one year old are financially crippled because permits are not being issued. One man with 30 such cattle had a valuation of 98 cent per pound on Tuesday but by Wednesday morning, because the cattle were one day over one year old, the value was slashed to 84 cent. I know a farm where a brucellosis storm erupted several months ago but now, while the herd is to be depopulated, nobody seems able to do anything about getting the cattle killed to remove the source of infection.I know farms where reactor TB animals are walking around in fields. They have been identified as reactors but nobody came to collect them and get them out of the way. I cannot understand why the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not at the centre of this matter. I have not heard a peep out of him over the past five weeks. Where is the Minister for Finance? While I realise that the union also has a responsibility in this matter, as long as the union and the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food stay apart, farmers will suffer.I am long enough in this House, as is the Minister, to know that this dispute will be settled. It all depends on how long the Minister is prepared to allow the farmers in the counties concerned to suffer. If this matter was nationwide and all 26 counties were involved, it would be solved today. The matter is serious and I hope that tomorrow will not pass without the Government, particularly the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance, and the union knocking heads together to see what can be done. Whatever is done, by tomorrow evening the Minister should ensure that, in regard to genuine hardship cases, farmers are allowed to sell before they are crippled with costs. The Minister knows all about this as that is his job, and I make a plea to him to address this problem. I hope he understands that the farmers concerned could not be more seriously affected by this situation.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	520	I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me on this important issue. It should be raised in the House at every opportunity because it has extremely serious consequences for farmers, not just in regard to the areas mentioned but also in regard to the entire union sector.One of the few young farmers committed to staying in farming in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan rang me on my way to the House today and that is why I have asked for the opportunity to put his problem on the record. That young farmer put in his REPS forms in February. He has been advised by his local office that it cannot get anyone to deal with those forms because of the slow-down. This young man wants and deserves his REPS money. My area suffered greatly due to weather conditions last year. I ask the Minister to make every effort to have this dispute settled and to make available the personnel involved, or even if they are not directly involved in this dispute, to put payments through.Last but by no means least, in an area such as Monaghan where there is an office which has had available space offered to it, the Minister should ensure that such space is put to use. Extra staff should be allowed and, in that context, promotions should be available.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	521	The Civil and Public Services Union dispute with the Department of Agriculture and Food is now entering its sixth week. I wish to raise the background to the dispute. Two years ago, in the aftermath of the successful outcome to the foot and mouth crisis, the union raised with management the long-standing claim to improved promotional opportunities for members in the Department's local offices throughout the country. The union had long held the view that there was inadequate scrutiny of payments made to local offices and that an unfair burden rests with the clerical officers maintaining the payments system.I understand that the Department indicated support for the position and proposed 35 additional staff officer posts, which fell far short of the union's requirement. There are 27 local offices of the Department of Agriculture and Food around the country but only 70 staff officer posts for a total of 900 clerical officers. This is a ratio of 13:1 which compares to a national ratio of 9:1 for the Civil Service as a whole, and a ratio of 5:1 in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, a Department of comparable spread to the Department of Agriculture and Food.In regard to promotions for staff officers and executive officers, the ratio in the Department of Agriculture and Food is 6.5:1 as opposed to 2.2:1 for the Civil Service as a whole. This means that staff in Department of Agriculture and Food local offices are three times less likely to be promoted than their Civil Service colleagues.The union spent two years negotiating with the Department to try to put in place an acceptable promotion structure. It was only at the end of these discussions, with the original offer no longer on the table, that the union reluctantly resorted to limited industrial action. This industrial action took the form of a limited restriction on counter and telephone duties. It rotated between four different regions so that not all the Department was affected at any one time. It was, by any stretch of the imagination, limited protest action which, while inconveniencing the public, was not causing serious disruption.At the end of week two of the dispute it was agreed between the union and management to hold a meeting to discuss a resolution to the issues in dispute on Wednesday, 2 April 2003. The union was committed to getting substantive discussions going to resolve the dispute and in such circumstances would not have resorted to an escalation of the industrial action. At 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 1 April, the day before the meeting was due to take place, management removed all the CPSU members from the payroll in counties Mayo, Galway, Limerick and Kerry. This effectively locked them out of their employment for daring to resort to limited industrial action.I understand this dispute is not in breach of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and that the management action in removing staff from the payroll when talks to seek a resolution to the dispute were about to commence has made the staff more determined than ever to achieve a just solution to the claim.Both my colleagues have pointed out that the dispute is affecting the farming population as regards REPS payments, farm waste management payments and dairy hygiene grants which currently are not being processed. Livestock farmers have been unable to lodge suckler cow grant applications since 1 April. Those who lodged their applications before 1 April did not get back their cards. Payment of the 20% balance of the suckler cow grant is held up because of the dispute and a small number of farmers have still not been paid 80% of their grant since 2002.As Deputy Connaughton said, it is very important at this stage that the Minister ensures that negotiations commence immediately to find a resolution to this dispute. It is not only affecting the farming community but also morale in the Department's offices throughout the country. It is very unfair because most of the people currently in dispute are female. It is sad to see so many women walking outside the local office in Tralee. It is not fair to lay such a heavy hand on this sector of the public service.I am convinced that with the Minister's intervention, in co-operation with the Department of Finance, a resolution can be found to this problem immediately. I agree with Deputy Connaughton that the sooner this dispute is resolved, the better.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	522	With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will reply to both matters.I thank Deputies Connaughton, Crawford and Deenihan for raising this matter because I wanted to have an opportunity to update the House on the action being taken by the CPSU and my Department in relation to the difficulties at the local offices. On the background to the dispute, last February CPSU members in the Department's local offices voted in favour of industrial action to secure what they considered improved promotional opportunities. The industrial action commenced in the local offices with effect from Tuesday, 18 March 2003. The union members decided not to perform normal duties arising from telephone calls and faxes. In addition, they refused to perform duties at reception desks. The services provided by our local offices are essential to the farming community and I agree with the Deputies that hardship is being caused to individual farmers, particularly in the context of cattle movements to marts and factories as well as direct payments to farmers.In an effort to resolve the matter, officials from my Department met CPSU representatives on 2 April but unfortunately there was no basis for settlement. Initially the CPSU had advised the Department that it would regionalise the dispute into four regions but following the meeting on 2 April, the CPSU advised that the officers who were removed from the payroll in Galway, Limerick, Mayo and Kerry would not be returning to work until the dispute was resolved. It also indicated that it would be picketing the offices involved from 3 April. Non-local office CPSU members in the Castlebar office have refused to pass the picket since that date also.Since 28 April, the CPSU extended its industrial action to the Department's Clonakilty office and it also engaged in limited industrial action on a random basis in other local offices in Sligo, Navan, Portlaoise and Kilkenny.The Department's decision to remove staff from the payroll was not taken lightly. However, given that the CPSU staff members involved refused to perform core duties, arrangements were made to remove them from the payroll with effect from 2 April. The details of the staff numbers removed from the payroll are as follows: Galway, 75; Kerry, 45; Mayo local office, 51; Mayo headquarters, 37; Limerick, 31 and Clonakilty, 23. I emphasise that normal duties are being carried out by CPSU members in offices other than those in Kerry, Limerick, Mayo, Galway and Clonakilty, County Cork.I regret the union's action is contrary to the existing Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the new Sustaining Progress agreement and cannot be condoned. These agreements specifically exclude cost increasing claims over and above the increases provided for under the agreements. The CPSU claim is for more promotion posts and this will obviously involve higher costs for the Department of Agriculture and Food. Moreover, all unions undertook in these agreements not to engage in industrial action in pursuit of claims.The special provisions, which are set out on page 35 of the PPF, state that no cost-increasing claims by trade unions or employees for improvements in pay or conditions of employment, other than those provided in clauses 3 to 5, will be made or processed during the currency of the agreement; employers, trade unions and employees are committed to promoting industrial harmony; and strikes or other forms of industrial action by trade unions, employees or employers are precluded in respect of any matters covered by the agreement where the employer or trade union concerned is acting in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.The Sustaining Progress agreement reinforces this commitment. This agreement provides for a 7% pay increase for all civil servants and for the payment of the relevant awards made by the benchmarking body. In the case of the CPSU this involves a further 8.5% increase.The national implementation body issued a statement on 10 April stating that full compliance with the industrial stability and peace provisions of the above agreements from the date of ratification is essential for the first payments to be made under the general pay terms and benchmarking awards due to be paid on 1 January 2004.My Department is examining the staffing of local offices. However, any reorganisation involving upgradings will have to be dealt with against a background of the continuing need to control public finances. In any event, as I have said, the industrial action is contrary to the social partnership agreements and I appeal to the union to instruct its members to resume duty.I state clearly that the scope for agreeing any deal is limited by the terms of the various social partnership agreements, the need to control public expenditure and the implications for other sectors of the public service if a concession is made in this case.I am fully aware that the actions being taken by the CPSU members are causing unnecessary hardship to the farming community. I regret that the staff in my Department are involved in such actions and I have requested them to return to work.I am aware that in all these cases a resolution is ultimately concluded and I am satisfied in this case that, with goodwill and a commitment from our side, the structuring and restructuring of local offices can be part of those negotiations and that a resolution can be found. I reiterate that my Department's officials are available to meet the CPSU with a view to an early resolution of this matter. Farmers have enough problems without having difficulties in getting cattle to marts and onwards. Farmers are awaiting the payments due to them and I want to see all these matters resolved, but it is impossible to do that without a degree of goodwill from the union concerned. That has become easier over the past few days. Contact is taking place between the Department and the CPSU. I hope and expect, if there is evidence of goodwill during the contacts concerned, that there will be an early resolution of this matter.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	524	There has been considerable flooding in Dublin city over the past 18 to 20 months. There was substantial flooding in February 2001 in the East Wall, North Strand and Ringsend areas and on 14 and 15 November 2002 there was a devastating flood in the Tolka River. Such extensive flooding over a brief period is a matter of considerable concern.Tremendous damage was caused by the flood last November and I will concentrate on that because the damage caused by the other flood has been addressed. The local authority, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, drafted a set of interim remedial proposals costing approximately €10 million to alleviate the worst effects of the flood and to render the Tolka River in a better position to cope with a flood in the short-term. Substantial work is in the pipeline and a review is due to be carried out on all the water channels in Dublin city. It is envisaged that the work will cost €100 million.Remedial works costing €10 million were promised and agreed and I seek to ensure that money is made available. Limited remedial works, in comparison to those promised in a report carried out at the time of the Tolka River flood, have been carried out and constituents are not sure whether the balance of the work will be undertaken in 2003. It is important that the work is carried out because there have been two floods in that vicinity over the past 20 months. If it is not carried out, there will be many problems.One of the major problems relates to the insurance industry. The industry, through letters issued by companies and statements made by its representative body, regards the inaction of the local authority and the Government as a reason to increase premia or not to provide quotes at all, particularly if the action to be taken is not sufficiently proportionate to the threat of future flooding. That is a serious matter and a number of residents have received letters of that nature.Following the flooding in the East Wall area, representatives of Dublin City Council, the Irish Insurance Federation and local residents agreed proposals to address the flooding and because there was sufficient funding available to carry out the necessary remedial works, the insurance companies agreed that in those circumstances there would be a moratorium on premia increases and they would wait for the Government to ensure the work was carried out.I call on the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, to host a meeting involving all the interested bodies to ensure policy holders do not receive letters similar to those I have described, a letter refusing to quote or a quote with a considerable excess. The way to avoid this is to negotiate in advance. Funding should be made available to carry out the work before the end of the year and a meeting should be hosted by the Minister of State.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I am pleased to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon. As the House will be aware, work has been ongoing on the interim flood alleviation measures on the River Tolka in the Glasnevin and Drumcondra areas of Dublin city, since January of this year. Some of the embankments have been constructed at this stage, most notably on the left bank immediately upstream of Drumcondra Bridge and further upstream in Griffith Park. The landscaping of these embankments is due to take place in the next two weeks.The replacement of the Woodville Road footbridge is under way and is expected to be completed in June of this year. The construction and raising of some walls has commenced and most of the walls in the vicinity of Drumcondra Bridge will be completed by the end of June. A new wall behind the school on Botanic Avenue will be constructed during the summer holidays. The ground level between the senior citizens' accommodation and Tolka Park has been raised and construction on the wall to support this will commence later this month. The maintenance cleaning of the channel from Distillery Weir to Glasnevin Bridge has been completed.All of these works will be completed in 2003 and the total cost of these works being implemented in the Dublin city area of the Tolka is expected to be in the region of €700,000. In addition to these works, emergency measures were undertaken by the Office of Public Works in December 2002 to prevent three houses, off Tolka Road, from subsiding into the river.Not all the recommendations contained in the interim report are being carried out at this time. Given the requirements for site investigations, detailed design of the works, public consultation and public procurement procedures, and environmental considerations it would take quite a considerable time to implement all of the recommendations of the interim report. The concern of the city council and the Office of Public Works has been to devise a package of works which can be carried out before next winter and which will provide a substantial degree of protection should similar flood events recur. The full report on the River Tolka catchment is due to be completed soon and will provide additional information on which decisions regarding the entire Tolka catchment can be made.The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, met the Tolka River Residents Alliance, which I assume is the group the Deputy mentioned, last month and fully understands its concerns over the insurance situation. He has also met the Irish Insurance Federation last December to discuss the situation. The House will also be aware that the Minister of State set up a review group last November to carry out a major review of national flooding policy. The review group has consulted a wide range of relevant bodies and is currently arranging a meeting with the insurance federation to discuss the matter further. I agree with the Deputy that home insurance cover should be provided to areas at risk of flooding at a reasonable cost.

The health strategy, primary care strategy and the value for money report were mentioned in passing. The Minister for Health and Children also promised that in the next six to eight weeks the Brennan, Prospectus and radiotherapy reports will be published. I refer specifically to the maternity and accident and emergency services in County Wexford. Comhairle na nOspidéil has a record of accident and emergency services as well as the final report of the steering group on nursing and midwifery resources.Two reports are relevant at local level. These are the patient dependency report, enhanced midwifery practice, which was published in June 2001, and another commissioned by the Medical Protection Society which was published in January 2002.Both of these reports show an increase in the number of births in Wexford General Hospital and both recommended an increase in the number of midwives and care attendants in the hospital. However, we have not seen any increase in either midwives or care attendants since the publication of the reports.There were some reports this evening saying this was an unsafe practice, which it is. The reason young babies and their mothers still remain safe in Wexford General Hospital is because nurses work longer hours, they come in on their day off and, on occasion, have cancelled annual leave. This situation is unsustainable in the long-term. I assume the Minister received the reports since this morning so there is no need for me to repeat the figures. The people of Wexford would like to know what future there is for midwifery services in the county.There are two issues in regard to accident and emergency services. The immediate issue is that two of the temporary registered doctors in Wexford hospital have resigned their positions earlier than expected. As a result, there is a strong likelihood that the Wexford accident and emergency department could be closed in the short-term. More importantly, Comhairle na nOspidéal, which recommended the appointment of an accident and emergency consultant to Wexford General Hospital, has sent back that application.We need to know whether the long-term prospect for the Wexford accident and emergency department involves its closing down because Comhairle na nOspidéal does not seem to approve of sending a consultant to accident and emergency departments. Is it only Wexford that will be affected or could this affect all single-handed accident and emergency departments, not only in the south-east but throughout the country?I know the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, cannot be expected to give answers to these questions as it is not his Department, but he may have answers for me and I thank him for waiting to reply. The issue has been ongoing for over a year.We know how the situation works. College bodies, which appoint consultants, will not give accreditation for junior doctors to work in accident and emergency departments that do not have a consultant. There has been some leeway in this over the last year and a half where a consultant surgeon in the hospital can take over the role of the teaching doctor. This has allowed accident and emergency services to stay open. What I am hoping to hear is that the people of Wexford can finally be taken off the waiting game in regard to this issue. Can the Minister give me solid answers to these questions?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I am pleased to reply to Deputy Twomey on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. As Deputy Twomey is from west Cork I will be even more pleased to give solid replies and as comprehensive and sympathetic a reply as I can.I am pleased with the opportunity afforded to me to set out the position regarding accident and emergency services and maternity services at Wexford General Hospital. The provision of services at Wexford General Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.In regard to the accident and emergency department, I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board that there is no threat to the closure of this unit arising from registration issues regarding non-national or non-EU consultant hospital doctors.Under the Medical Practitioners Act, the Medical Council is charged with responsibility for the registration and regulation of medical practitioners. Doctors are registered on the general register of medical practitioners. At present there are three types of such registration – internship registration, temporary registration and full registration.Internship registration is granted to graduates of Irish and EU medical schools. Temporary registration is granted to medical graduates from non-EU countries. A doctor who has temporary registration for a minimum period of two years may apply for full registration. Full registration is also granted to those who are nationals of an EU member state, who are appropriately qualified and satisfy any other training requirements as specified under the Medical Practitioners Act.Registration on the register of medical practitioners is a requirement for employment in the public health service. The Medical Council carries out inspections of hospitals for the purpose of approving posts for training purposes. It only approves temporary registration for doctors who are being assigned to approved training posts. Many fully registered doctors would also be undergoing ongoing training.The Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Act 2002 came into operation on the 1 May 2002. Under the provisions of the Act the Medical Council has drafted rules relating to the registration of medical practitioners, the recognition of health care settings in which training may take place, the recognition of primary qualifications obtained from EU medical schools for the purposes of internship registration and rules relating to short-term, temporary registration. The consultation process regarding the Medical Council draft rules is almost concluded and the Minister hopes to be in a position to decide on the draft rules in the near future.In the meantime, the Minister wishes to reiterate that no doctor has lost registration due to the period taken to consult on and prepare the draft rules. The Act makes provision for any medical practitioner who holds temporary registration, such as a number of non-EU doctors, and who has applied for full registration under the Act to have his or her period of temporary registration extended indefinitely until such time as a final decision is given regarding his or her application.The interagency health care forum was set up late in 2001 with the purpose of facilitating ongoing communication between health service providers and managers to improve mutual understanding and co-operation. The need to balance registration and training issues, particularly in the context of service delivery, is one of the topics regularly discussed by the forum.The Minister has provided this year for the appointment of three additional consultants in emergency medicine for the South-Eastern Health Board, one of whom will have responsibility for the accident and emergency department in Wexford General Hospital. I understand that the board is currently in discussion with Comhairle na nOspidéal regarding these posts.As regards maternity services, considerable progress has been made in developing and improving services at Wexford General Hospital. The unit is staffed by highly-qualified, dedicated professionals who provide a safe and responsive service to patients. Further developments are taking place regarding this service.A third consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist post has been approved and it is expected that the post will be filled next month. The hospital recently conducted interviews and established a panel to fill existing midwifery vacancies at the hospital. Other initiatives include the permanent appointment of a midwifery manager, the training of two staff midwives in ultrasonography and the advertising of a permanent post of colposcopy nurse with a special interest in women's health and in early pregnancy assessment.Wexford General Hospital is beginning to operate a new Domino birth programme. The programme allows women to deliver their babies in hospital and be discharged within six hours of delivery with community midwifery support. This programme provides greater choice to the women of Wexford and will allow them to return to their home and family at the earliest opportunity after delivery. The development of this service will also help to reduce pressures in the maternity unit. A team leader and a midwife have been recruited for this programme and the recruitment process to appoint further staff is under way.The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 May 2003.

The Ombudsman's interpretation of the provisions of Health Act 1970, as amended, in relation to a person's entitlement to be provided with in-patient services by a health board is at variance with my Department's view on this matter and this view is supported by legal advice available to my Department. My Department advised the Ombudsman prior to the publication of his report of its view that the Health Act 1970, as amended, distinguishes between eligibility for a service and entitlement to a service, although the two terms are often used interchangeably which can lead to confusion.The nature of the obligation imposed on health boards under the Health Act 1970 to make available in-patient services is not such as to confer an entitlement on an individual to be provided with such services in so far as this may be taken to mean a legally enforceable right capable of being enforced by mandatory order.The health strategy acknowledges the need to clarify and simplify eligibility arrangements for health services, including in-patient services, and it sets down a commitment to introduce new legislation to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility for health and personal social services. As part of the implementation process, a review of all existing legislation is currently under way in my Department. The outcome of the review will inform the approach to the drafting of a new legislative framework on eligibility and I expect that this review will be completed shortly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Proposals have been made by my Department to the Department of Finance regarding the contribution of the health sector, through natural wastage, to the planned overall reduction in public service numbers. These proposals are currently the subject of contact between officials of both Departments. The key principle guiding the implementation of the measure in the health sector will be to minimise the impact on the high proportion of health service employees engaged in providing front line services to the public and should be viewed against the backdrop of very significant increases in employment over recent years. In this context, the Deputy may wish to note the increase of in excess of 28,000 or 42% in the approved employment level for the health services since 1997, bringing authorised employment numbers to 96,000, excluding home helps, in wholetime equivalent terms.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Following the publication of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services in March 2002, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.Given the key role of the Health Boards Executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of service imperatives funding priorities and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers.In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.

They will be useful for a wide range of statutory and non-statutory groups which are considering consulting with children and young people. I am fully supportive of these guidelines and I launched the research study Hearing Young Voices in September 2002 which formed the basis for these guidelines.The Hearing Young Voices research was conducted and compiled by Karen McAuley of the Children's Rights Alliance and Marian Brattman of the National Youth Council of Ireland on behalf of the Open Your Eyes to Child Poverty initiative. Hearing Young Voices was funded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and supported by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Irish Youth Foundation.The Open Your Eyes to Child Poverty initiative was a coalition of seven organisations that came together and worked for three years, 2000-02, to promote greater awareness of child poverty and to effect change in public policy to eliminate child poverty. The organisations involved in this initiative were, Barnardo's, Children's Rights Alliance, National Youth Council of Ireland, Focus Ireland, People with Disabilities in Ireland, Pavee Point and The Society of St. Vincent de Paul.On 4 February 2003, I launched the latest initiative of the above seven organisations, which is entitled the End Child Poverty Coalition. At this launch the Hearing Young Voices guidelines were also presented.I am responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the national children's strategy. The first goal of the strategy is that children will have a voice in matters which affect them and their views will be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity. The strategy acknowledges that support and guidance must be provided to agencies involved in consulting with children, in order to fully implement the first goal. The National Children's Office, which was established in 2000, is the State agency charged with driving implementation of the strategy. My officials in the National Children's Office have been working in co-operation with various statutory and non-statutory organisations to provide this support and guidance.Following a request for funding, to print additional copies of the guidelines, officials in the National Children's Office examined the Hearing Young Voices guidelines and met representatives of the End Child Poverty Coalition to discuss the issue. It was agreed that the Hearing Young Voices guidelines would be developed into a set of national guidelines for consulting with children and young people. The development and re-print of the guidelines is being carried out in co-operation with the End Child Poverty Coalition. The layout, design and reprint of the guidelines will be fully funded by the National Children's Office.

These are concerns which the Government shares and which it intends to address. The Amnesty report acknowledges the significant advances made in this country in the provision of community psychiatry, nursing services, community residences, day hospitals and day centres since the publication of the landmark 1984 report, Planning for the Future.In the period 1999-2002, an additional €70.7 million was invested in the mental health services. In the current year, additional revenue funding of €7.6 million will be provided for ongoing improvements in mental health services, to develop and expand community mental health services, to increase child and adolescent services, to expand the old age psychiatry services, to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and to enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.

When the authority were made aware of the current difficulties with waiting times for the services at St. Louise's assessment and treatment service, a review of the child sexual abuse assessment and treatment services in the eastern region was commenced. This includes a review of the services provided at St. Claire's unit, Temple Street Hospital. A steering group to oversee the review process, monitor progress and develop recommendations has been established and a dedicated researcher has been appointed. Some preliminary findings are available and work is ongoing in terms of continued examination of the current procedures, review of best practice nationally and internationally and recommendations for improved services.

I established the pharmacy review group, chaired by Professor Michael Mortell, in November 2001 to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group based its approach on the principles set out for evidence-based policy formulation by the EU-level Mandelkern group – the Mandelkern Group on Better Regulation Final Report, 13 November 2001. These include: public and interest group consultation; analysis of the existing position; and analysis of possible options. The group consulted widely and, in particular, invited submissions from consumer interests and special interest groups such as the Asthma Society and the Irish Heart Foundation.The pharmacy review group submitted its report on 31 January 2003. I am currently examining the recommendations contained in the report, and it is my intention that it will be published as soon as possible. Deputies will appreciate that it would be not be appropriate for me to comment on the report's recommendations before publication.

The objective of the directive is to set out a general framework and safety rules for vitamins and minerals in the EU and to ensure that these products are appropriately labelled so that consumers can make informed choices.As far as vitamins and minerals are concerned, the directive does two things. First, it establishes lists of vitamins and minerals and their forms that can be used in the manufacture of food supplements. Second, it foresees the setting of maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. This will be based on scientific risk assessment and data on vitamin and minerals intake from other foods, while also taking due account of what is considered an adequate vitamin and mineral intake for an average person. The scientific risk assessment will be undertaken by EFSA , the European Food Safety Authority.Drafting of national legislation to give effect to the directive is under way and this drafting process has included consultations between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Medicines Board and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. My Department has also had contact with the Irish Health Trade Association and the Irish Association of Health Stores.

The implementation of the index was piloted in the North-Eastern Health Board during 2002. The lessons learned from the pilot were that the implementation of the index will have a significant impact on existing business processes in health boards. Based on the experience of the pilot project, the GMS Payments Board and health boards have conducted a review of the scope of the changes necessary. Arrangements are currently being put in place to amend the business processes in each health board to bring them into line with the requirements of the national client eligibility index. The main project is expected to be recommenced shortly and the GMS Payments Board plans to commence roll out of the project to health boards during 2003. It has been agreed that the unique client identifier will be the PPSN. If this is not available an alternative internal number will be used for a limited period during which the registering board will obtain the PPSN.The national client eligibility index is being implemented from the perspective of better customer service and efficiency. When fully in place, it is expected to facilitate the provision of speedier service to health service customers, generate significant savings in health expenditure and will be available as a valuable tool for health service planners at all levels.

This sum was utilised to advance the considerable preparatory work necessary to support the full establishment of the programme, including the provision of appropriate assessment facilities for patients, and the appointment of key transplant personnel at the Mater Hospital, Dublin.The funding of €3.4 million has been repeated this year; in addition, a further €4.5 million has been provided bringing the total revenue funding to €7.9 million. This will be used to fund the continuation of the services currently in place and to support the commencement of the surgical and post-operative care components of the programme later this year.

Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with an intellectual disability. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.

The community units in Maynooth and Lusk which opened in 2002 each have provision for 50 beds of which 35 and 45, respectively, are on-stream. The ERHA is currently exploring with my Department and business advisers the feasibility of developing nine new 50 bed units on a public private partnership basis; MHB – The board has advised that no additional extended care or community nursing unit beds have come on-stream this year to date. The new community nursing unit in Birr which has 90 beds will, when commissioned, provide a net increase of 20 beds. The board is hoping to shortly proceed to equip the new unit and will be considering the options available to it to open the beds this year; MWHB – The board has advised that no additional extended care or community nursing unit places are planned or due to come on-stream in 2003. A 12-bed dementia unit is due to open in St. Joseph's Hospital, Ennis in June 2003. However, these are not additional beds but a re-designation of existing beds. Also, an additional four palliative care support beds will be opened in 2003, but these are re-designated rather than additional beds; NEHB – The board has advised that there are no additional extended care or community nursing unit places planned or due to come on-stream in 2003; NWHB – No additional extended care or community nursing places have been provided in 2003 and there are no places due to come on-stream; SEHB – The board has advised that four additional long stay beds have been provided at Castlecomer District Hospital. Within Phase 1 of the Cashel-Clonmel agreement, a 20 bed EMI unit is due to be completed in 2003; SHB – The board has advised that to date in 2003, no additional extended care beds have been provided. The public-private partnership project to provide eight additional community nursing units, a total of 400 beds, is currently in development. A 30-bed extension to St Luke's Home in Mahon is expected to be completed by the end of 2003. As part of the NDP programme 2001-2006, a new community hospital in Dingle, a new community nursing unit in Tralee and extensions to various community hospitals throughout Cork and Kerry are at various stages of planning. No further progress is expected until the NDP review is completed; and WHB – the board has advised that no additional extended care and community nursing unit places have been planned for 2003.

Since the launch of this strategy in November 2001, a number of essential implementation steps have been taken.In April 2002 I established the primary care task force within my Department to drive the implementation of the changes and developments set out in the model. I established a national primary care steering group in June 2002 to give national leadership and guidance in relation to several key elements of the implementation plan. At regional level the health boards have also been requested to put in place structures to drive forward the implementation of the strategy.

The proposed sites are in the following locations: Clonskeagh Hospital, Newcastle Hospital, County Wicklow and Tivoli Road, Dún Laoghaire in the East Coast Area Health Board; St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny, St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park and Verville, Vernon Avenue, Clontarf in the Northern Area Health Board; St. Loman's Psychiatric Hospital, Palmerstown; Brú Chaoimhín and Cherry Orchard Hospital in the South-Western Area Health Board.The Southern Health Board proposes to develop eight CNUs in the following locations; St. Finbarr's Hospital, Farranlea Road, Wilton and Ballincollig in the South Lee area; St. Stephen's Hospital and the Orthopaedic Hospital in the North Lee area; Mount Alvernia, Mallow in the north Cork area; Bantry in the west Cork area and Tralee in Kerry.These additional beds are currently not available, as the process of providing services under a PPP arrangement requires the health board-authority to abide by EU procurement legislation for projects of this size. The ERHA and SHB have appointed business advisers to assist them in the delivery of this service. Outline business cases, OBCs, will be submitted for approval to the Department of Finance this summer. These are currently being prepared by the ERHA and the SHB. They will include public sector comparators, which are used to test whether the PPP proposal offers value for money in comparison with the most efficient form of public procurement. If approved by the Department of Finance, the next stage for the ERHA and SHB will be to advertise in the OJEC for consortia to design, build, finance and partially operate the facilities.

This prohibition is based on recommendations contained in the Report on the Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke, ETS, in the Workplace prepared by an independent scientific working group commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority which was published on 30 January 2003.The primary purpose of the prohibition is to protect the health and safety of workers and the public from toxic environmental tobacco smoke. The owner, occupier or person in charge of a licensed premises is legally responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety requirements as well as a range of other legislation relating, for example, to fire safety, food hygiene and the control of the sale of alcohol and tobacco products to underage persons. Since the announcement I have been carrying out a consultation process with interested parties regarding implementation.I expect that the vast majority of customers will comply with the new health and safety measures when introduced.Monitoring compliance with and enforcement of the ban on smoking can also be carried out by authorised officers from the Health and Safety Authority, the Office of Tobacco Control and the health boards.

However, I understand that all health boards are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of therapy posts and particularly in filling senior vacancies.Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	551	The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.As the Deputy is aware, I established the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was launched on 10 September 2002 and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.The forum also concluded that: water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected; dental fluorosis – a form of discoloration of the tooth enamel – is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research. Ultimately, the forum took an evidence based approach to its examination of water fluoridation.The report of the Fluoridation Forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. I have asked my Department to establish an expert body as recommended by the forum. This expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride going forward. The establishment of this expert body is in train.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 138 together. As the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, on foot of an acknowledgement by all parties of the need for an overall development of the facilities at Crumlin hospital, I approved the establishment of a project team to plan for the future development of the hospital. The team includes representatives from the hospital, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children.Many of the buildings comprised within the hospital are approximately 50 years old and have not been upgraded in any significant way over that period. As a result, they do not now generally meet contemporary standards for paediatric hospital facilities.The first stage of the planning process involves writing a brief for the preparation of a development control plan which will set the context for future capital developments on the site. Work on the preparation of the development brief has commenced, and it is expected to be completed by the end of 2003.It is intended that a phased approach to new development and the upgrade of facilities will be taken. The plans will allow for the prioritisation of developments according to the service needs of the hospital and the ERHA. A phased approach will ensure that services continue to be provided at the hospital during the redevelopment.A number of additional major developments, funded by the Exchequer, are currently being put in place at the hospital. These include a €30 million investment in the new operating department which will provide two additional theatres, increasing the capacity of the hospital to five major theatres and two minor theatres. Included in this development are new recovery beds, a day surgery unit and a modern central sterile supplies department. This development is expected to increase the capacity of the hospital to meet the additional surgery demands at both in-patient and out-patient level.In addition, on the basis of the volume and complexity of cases being dealt with at the hospital, I approved the provision of an MRI facility at Crumlin which will significantly enhance the level of diagnostic services provided for children. The project team is currently engaged in the process of identifying the most appropriate location for this service in the context of the overall development plan for the hospital.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	553	At present there are about 105 clinical psychologists undertaking post graduate training in the State. Over 60 students are enrolled on the Psychological Society of Ireland's clinical psychologist post graduate training diploma, 24 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at TCD – 12 in first year and 12 in second year – and 19 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at UCD – ten in second year and nine in third year. Since end-1999 there has been a threefold increase, from 26 to 83, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services. It is understood that both the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick have plans to introduce doctoral programmes in clinical psychology in 2003 with an intake of a further 20 students in total.My Department is committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services.

The social services inspectorate, SSI, was established in April 1999 initially on an administrative basis but, in the longer term, it is proposed to establish it on a statutory basis. The main function of the inspectorate is to support the child care services by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards. The SSI will monitor all personal social services operated by the health boards, but initially it is concentrating on the child care area and in particular on the inspection of health board operated residential child care facilities.The health strategy, Quality and Fairness, has set 2003 as the target date for the establishment of the SSI on a statutory basis. It also states that the remit of the SSI will be extended to cover residential care for older people and people with disabilities.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	558	In November 2001, I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to produce a situation report about the position in Ireland and in the United States in respect of a possible investigation into the actions of the multinational pharmaceutical companies whose products are implicated in the HIV and hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia.As part of his investigations, Mr. Gardiner liaised with solicitors acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society. He travelled to the United States and spoke to a number of relevant experts, including the lead counsel in the HIV haemophiliac litigation in the United States. Mr. Gardiner also received legal advice from a major New York law firm in relation to the matters relevant to his investigations.Mr. Gardiner furnished a report to me which consisted of a 60 page opinion and a number of appendices, one of which comprised over 50 pages of legal advice from the US lawyers. The report drew attention to the fact that there is no guarantee that the US authorities would provide judicial assistance to an Irish tribunal, either in relation to enforcing the discovery of documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses.I briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the content of the report and I provided the Irish Haemophilia Society with a copy of it. Following further consultations with Mr. Gardiner late last year, I believe it would be possible to mount a useful investigation which would access publicly available material and seek the assistance of persons and bodies willing to co-operate with such an investigation.I am in ongoing consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to the format and scope of the proposed investigation. I intend to present proposals to Government in the not too distant future.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	559	My attention was drawn to the recent claims referred to by the Deputy. I can confirm that there is no embargo on recruitment of staff imposed by my Department. The chief executive officer of each individual health board-authority has responsibility for the management of the workforce, including the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff employed within that board, in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the authorised ceiling.I have been informed by the Northern Area Health Board, which has operational responsibility for Crannóg Nua high support unit, that there are currently four children in residence with one more child approved for admission subject to the recruitment of the required number of staff. This centre commenced operation last September and will be brought on-stream on a phased basis. There are currently 25 child care staff employed in the unit.The issue in relation to Crannóg Nua which, as a high support unit, requires a high staff client ratio, is not over a staff ceiling but over difficulties in recruiting and retaining suitable staff.The Northern Area Health Board has been actively attempting to progress the recruitment of the required staff via local and international recruitment methods. At present there are 17 candidates placed on three recruitment panels, one formed locally and two formed from recruitment drives in the United Kingdom and Europe. It is anticipated that these candidates will be taking up duty in the near future. Prior to taking up full duties all new staff must first undergo an eight-week induction training programme. Further recruitment campaigns are planned.

The group has conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision.The group's report will address the following key issues: access to radiotherapy services in terms of information, financial access and organisational components of access; the need to provide a high quality, evidence based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing; and the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be place in a radiotherapy facility.All health boards have been afforded the opportunity to meet with and make submissions to the group. The provision of additional radiotherapy services will be considered in the context of the report of the expert working group. Following consideration of the report, I will submit proposals for consideration by Government.

The task force on autism, which was established by the Department of Education and Science, has put forward a range of recommendations ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services, the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues. The scope of the task force's recommendations is such as to require a multi-faceted response involving educational and health care inputs. The task force's recommendations are currently being considered by both Departments.There has been a significant investment in both health-related and educational supports for persons with autism in recent years. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated by my Department to services for persons with autism or intellectual disability in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with autism or intellectual disability. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and approximately 2,000 new day places for people with autism and those with an intellectual disability.In particular, €14.6 million has been invested by my Department in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school going age. The health boards have been developing regional diagnostic and assessment services and these are at varying stages of development.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	565	By way of background, I should explain that the future provision of paediatric surgery services was reviewed in 1997-98 by Comhairle na nOspidéal, in the absence of agreement among the three paediatric hospitals in Dublin on the filling of a consultant paediatric surgery vacancy which had arisen. Comhairle recommended that specialist paediatric and neonatal surgery for the children of the State should be concentrated in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, because of the relatively small volume of cases and the high level of multidisciplinary expertise required. It is envisaged all three paediatric hospitals continuing to provide non-specialist paediatric surgery and less complex urology services.Temple Street Hospital has not accepted the proposed transfer of the specialist surgical procedures to Crumlin and, largely as a result of that, it has not been possible to proceed with the permanent filling of the vacancy referred to by the Deputy. This is despite the fact that the filling of the vacancy has been approved by Comhairle and that the necessary funding is available from the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In an effort to break the impasse, Comhairle na nOspidéal established a sub-committee last year which has met with various interests, including paediatric surgeons, neonatologists, representatives of Temple Street and Crumlin Hospitals, the ERHA and my Department.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	566	There has been for many years a recognised shortage of representative health and lifestyle data available to health service planners. To remedy this perceived information gap the Health Promotion Unit of my Department commissioned in 1998 the National Health and Lifestyle surveys to be carried out at four yearly intervals. The first report was published in 1999 and the second on 16 April 2003. These surveys aim to produce reliable baseline data on key health related lifestyle behaviours including smoking, alcohol and exercise for a representative cross-section of the Irish population.As there are many external and environmental factors that influence and determine health, the data collected was also analysed in terms of socio-economic groupings and educational status. This data acts as an invaluable resource in informing future policy and programme setting at both national and regional levels as well as providing a useful tool for making European and international comparisons. The repetitive nature of the process also allows trends to be identified in health and lifestyle behaviours. In identifying and more importantly monitoring changes in these trends, national and regional priorities in health promotion activities can be identified. The implications of the second report are currently being considered in my Department.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	573	I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 543 together.Legionnaires' disease is an uncommon form of pneumonia that may have serious consequences for some people, especially people in the older age groups. It is caused by an organism called legionella pneumophila. Legionella is a group of bacteria commonly found in low, harmless numbers in water, including tap water, but they can multiply to high levels in stagnant water, especially in water temperatures in the range 20ºC to 45ºC. These organisms do not appear to multiply below 20ºC and do not survive above 60ºC. They may, however, remain dormant in cool water and multiply when temperatures reach a suitable level.People become infected when they breathe in air that contains legionella bacteria which have been dispersed into the air in very fine droplets of water known as aerosols. If the bacteria gets inhaled into the lungs they can cause infection. Person to person spread does not occur. Anyone can develop legionnaires' disease but, the elderly, cigarette smokers, heavy drinkers, persons with chronic lung conditions, persons with immuno-compromising conditions and persons receiving immuno-suppressive drugs are all at increased risk. Cases may arise in community settings or in hospitals.Recognised and potential sources of legionella are hot and cold water systems; cooling towers and evaporative condensers in air-conditioning systems; respiratory and other therapy equipment; spa pools – jacuzzis-natural pools-thermal springs; fountains-sprinklers; humidifiers for food display cabinets; water cooling machine tools; and vehicle washer-carpet cleaner.The bacteria live naturally in environmental water sources but if they get into water systems in buildings they can cause a risk to humans through air conditioning systems or through contaminated water systems used for showers, etc. Control and prevention of the disease is through treatment of the source of infection, i.e. the contaminated water systems.As the Deputies will understand, I cannot refer to the specifics of individual cases due to patient confidentiality. However, I am aware that the South-Eastern Health Board is preparing a report on their recent case which I await.

The main aims of these surveys were to produce reliable data of a representative cross-section of the Irish population in order to form the basis of any departmental health promotion policy and programme planning. The aim is also to maintain a survey protocol, which will enable lifestyle factors to be re-measured so that trends can be identified, and changes monitored to assist national and regional setting of priorities in health promotion activities. The reports focus on these two cross-sectional studies, SLÁN, survey of lifestyles, attitudes and nutrition, adults aged 18+ years and HBSC, health behaviour in school-aged children, school-going children aged ten-17 years.In keeping with the health and lifestyle surveillance system of many European countries a number of related factors were measured in both surveys. These include general health, smoking, use of alcohol and other substances, food and nutrition, accidents and physical activity. While it is intended to continue with these national surveys there is, at this stage, no plan to conduct the research referred to by the Deputy.

However, health boards and specialist agencies in the health field have over the years developed some specialist pre-school services for children with disabilities and also facilitate, in certain circumstances, children with disabilities or those from disadvantaged backgrounds in accessing community and private pre-school services. The development of policy and services for pre-school children, including those with disabilities, is a matter for the Department of Education and Science. I assure the Deputy that my Department, together with the health boards and specialist agencies, will provide whatever assistance they can to that Department in this matter.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 402 together.I have on a number of occasions acknowledged that this is a year of greater pressure in the health services and that the health sector will have to manage service plans during 2003 in order that spending is contained within the approved level. Given the significant level of additional investment in services up to and including 2002, and the fact that the actual exceeded the planned activity level in 2002, the structuring of overall service plans by health agencies for 2003 was always going to involve some containment of service activity in order to manage within budget. Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996, otherwise known as the accountability legislation, health agencies are required to deliver a level of services consistent with their approved budgets. In a system that is demand-led and driven, in part, by high technology, any approach other than that set down in the legislation would create chaos in the health services. It would, ultimately, lead to the return of significant unapproved expenditure resulting in cash pressures which was the very reason why the 1996 legislation was introduced in the first place. It would also undermine the whole service planning process that is a key feature of the legislation and is a very positive aspect of the services since 1996. In regard to specific services, both the ERHA and the Dublin academic teaching hospitals, DATHs, have identified the areas of cancer, cardiovascular and renal as high priority specialities which should be protected as far as possible.The level of capital investment for the five major academic teaching hospitals which has been invested over recent years, or is planned, amounts to €781 million. This is, by any standards, a significant sum and reflects the Government's commitment to providing for a high quality level of service in those hospitals.The ERHA will be reporting to my Department very shortly on the overall situation and there will be a subsequent tripartite meeting between the Department, the ERHA and the DATHs to discuss the difficulties facing the services this year.

Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States public health service and the United States surgeon general.As the Deputy is aware, I established the forum on fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was launched on 10 September 2002 and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.The forum also concluded that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected; and dental fluorosis – a form of discoloration of the tooth enamel – is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research. Ultimately, the forum took an evidence based approach to its examination of water fluoridation. I have been informed that there is no risk to human health from dermal absorption of fluoride under normal conditions.The report of the fluoridation forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. I have asked my Department to establish an expert body as recommended by the forum. This expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride going forward, including issues such as those raised by the Deputy. The establishment of this expert body is in train.

There is a standing advisory group on the prevention of transmission of blood borne disease in the health care setting. This group has published a number of reports setting out guidelines for the prevention of transmission of diseases such as hepatitis B in the health care setting. The group consists of medical experts in this particular field and the guidelines are based on the best available information and international best practice.As technical advances are constantly being made and as our state of knowledge in relation to these threats to health is constantly being updated the standing advisory group meets regularly to consider updating and amending the guidelines. I am advised that a newly updated version of the guidelines will be available for publication shortly.

The assessment of entitlement to and payment of the mobility allowance in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. Applicants must be 16 years or older and under 66 years. The allowance provides financial support to eligible persons who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings – for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.Eligible persons must reside at home or in any long-stay facility. Such eligible persons can continue to receive payment after they reach their 66th birthday. The current maximum rate of payment for the mobility allowance is €132 per month.

This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.Given the key role of the health boards executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of: service imperatives; funding priorities; and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	588	On 30 January 2003 I launched the report on the Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke, ETS, in the Workplace which was commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority. One of the issues dealt with in the report is the effectiveness of ventilation and the expert advice is that current ventilation technologies are inadequate to give workers full protection from the hazards of tobacco smoke and that exposure can best be controlled by banning smoking in places of work. Acting on this advice I published draft regulations to provide for a prohibition on the smoking of tobacco products in all places of work which will come into operation on 1 January 2004.As the Deputy will be aware, smoking is already prohibited or restricted in a wide range of workplace situations under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Regulations 1995.

However, increased investment in this or any other developmental aspect of the strategy agenda, is dependent on the availability of the necessary additional resources. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.

In advance of this, the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2003 which makes further provision relating, inter alia, to risk equalisation has recently been signed into law.The current position is that BUPA Ireland has made a complaint to the EU Commission's Competition Directorate General about the proposed provision for risk equalisation. This has given rise to the notification, or submission, by my Department of the draft scheme to the directorate for consideration under EU state aid rules. This submission makes the case in relation to the necessity for risk equalisation in a market operated on the basis of core common good principles of community rating, open enrolment, and lifetime cover, and that it does not constitute state aid under EU competition rules. The timetable for bringing the draft scheme to the Houses of the Oireachtas will be determined in the light of the outcome of these deliberations at EU level. However, it is my intention to bring the draft scheme to the Houses for affirmation at an early date and, if possible, before the end of the current session.

In addition, the strategy proposed the provision of an extra 800 extended care-community nursing unit places per year over a seven year period, to include provision for people with dementia.As the Deputy may be aware, public-private partnerships, PPPs, are currently being piloted in the health sector. PPPs are based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially, the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units, CNUs, for older people. It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will be created when the initial pilot programmes are complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds in Dublin and Cork. The services offered in these units will include: assessment or rehabilitation; respite; extended care and convalescence. If the PPP pilot demonstrates success it is the intention to use it as a means of providing additional community nursing units in other locations throughout the country.The current position in relation to the PPP projects is that business advisers have been recruited by the ERHA and the Southern Health Board and they are in the process of preparing outline business plans.

This Act provides that part-time employees shall not be treated less favourably in respect of conditions of employment than full-time employees, with the exception of pensions or where the less favourable treatment can be justified on objective grounds.My Department's policy in relation to the protection of rights of such students is that the Labour Inspectorate enforces certain aspects of employment rights legislation, applying to all employees, including students in second level education who work part-time. One aspect of that enforcement includes the provisions of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. This Act is particularly relevant in the case of second level education students who work part-time. Inspectors' night work enforcement activity is almost exclusively related to their role in enforcement of that Act. Targeted inspections are often by way of out of normal office hours inspection activity, throughout various employment sectors, including fast food outlets, restaurants, licensed premises and hotels.Where it appears that an employer has failed to comply with the provisions of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996, the matter is referred to my Department's legal advisers for consideration as to the initiation of legal proceedings. Where inspectors find other infringements of employment rights protections and where voluntary compliance is not achieved to the satisfaction of my Department, such matters are also referred to my Department's legal advisers for consideration as to the initiation of legal proceedings.The employment rights information unit of my Department concluded a proactive awareness campaign during 2002 whereby all secondary schools were circulated with information on all aspects of employment law, including details of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996. Work is almost complete on a similar campaign this year. Staff of that unit also visit secondary schools, citizen information centres and other organisations to disseminate information on general employment rights protections, including the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.

In 1999, a number of events led to a flood of lower cost Far Eastern fibre, yarn and fabric into the US and European markets. This was primarily due to the expansion of capacity in the Far East and the Asian crisis of 1998 which caused demand there to drop and led to Far Eastern producers seeking markets in the US and Europe at any price. Unifi and other textile players responded to this increased supply by forming alliances, cuts in plants, employment and capacity to restructure the industry.In the year ended June 2000, Unifi Textured Yarns Europe experienced a loss of €2.9 million and a further loss of €10.8 million in June 2001. The company responded by addressing inefficiencies and cost reductions, eliminating loss leaders in certain markets and developing a new strategy to secure the future of the operation. This strategy focused on moving the company out of the commodity segment of the apparel market and into higher margin areas – industrial and automotive.

Over the past two years, IDA Ireland has radically changed its policy with the commitment to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One region in the coming years.IDA Ireland cemented its commitment to the north-west region in January 2002 when Sligo became one of three towns nationally to be recognised as growth centres for inward investment. IDA staff responsible for the national development and promotion of the engineering and consumer sector are now headquartered in Sligo, with a unit of international services also based there. This is in line with the new regional focus of the agency, where key operational responsibilities are being placed in the regions where results are sought.IDA Ireland is also working with Invest Northern Ireland, formerly the Industrial Development Board, to promote the north-west region as a single location for inward investment. A joint website has been compiled to promote the region. Letterkenny has been named as one of the new linked gateways recently announced in the Government's national spatial strategy and Derry has been named in the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland as a regional city for the north-west. A linked gateway is where two or more strong towns work in partnership to promote economic and social development in their region. The development of Letterkenny-Derry as a linked gateway will strengthen the attraction of the north-west as a location for foreign direct investment.There is a need for foreign direct investment that helps redress regional imbalances. Large urban centres have inherent advantages for investments, especially for those that are competed for globally. The challenge of achieving high value FDI into regional locations is considerable and the development of linked gateways is an important tool in advancing this objective.I am pleased that the chambers of commerce in the north-west cross-Border region have combined forces to progress agreed themes of common economic interest under the umbrella of the north-west chambers of commerce initiative. The group believes there is a great deal to be gained by working collectively on issues such as infrastructure, tourism, inward investment, education and training that will benefit the region as a whole.

I also understand that, at the request of some member states, the proposal was reactivated in early 2002. The subsequent adoption of a regulation, without debate at Council in January 2003, followed a decision by the Presidency of the Council to place it on the Council agenda. This was on the basis that qualified majority support for the text proposed by the Presidency had been signalled during discussions at official level.The main differentiating elements between the text of the proposal adopted by Council and the original Commission proposal are a narrowing of the scope of the end-users that can benefit from duty free third country imports and a broadening of the scope of products and components covered by the regulation. While an estimation of the duty foregone is not available, the Commission is to monitor the financial impact of the regulation. In terms of the impact on Irish industry, I understand that industry was consulted by my Department and did not indicate any concerns.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	615	As I indicated in a reply to a similar question on this matter earlier this year, the agencies of my Department are working to address the employment needs of Tallaght and south County Dublin and they will continue to promote the area for suitable investment projects in the future.IDA Ireland, the agency with statutory responsibility for attracting foreign direct investment, continues to work with companies in the Tallaght area to secure further projects which will benefit the area. The development of the Digital Park at City West, the installation of the global crossing cable and the four data centres located at the park will serve the Internet infrastructural needs of existing and new businesses. The area is well placed to attract additional business in the technology and e-business sector. A number of companies in the electronics, internationally traded services and software sectors, such as AOL, GE Interlogix, UPS and SAP, have established operations in the Tallaght and City West areas and will continue to grow in line with projections.In recent months, a world renowned high technology company, Google, has decided to locate in the area. Its decision to locate in Dublin positions Ireland as a prime location for global Internet services. In addition, Takeda Chemical Industries, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, has begun construction of a new plant at Grangecastle, Clondalkin, which will employ more than 60 people when fully operational. Also in Grangecastle, Wyeth Biopharma currently employs 500 highly skilled people in its new biotechnology facility and this will increase to 1,300 when the plant reaches full capacity.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	617	The legislative priorities of my Department for the current session are, with the continuing co-operation of the Houses and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, to progress the following published Bills currently at various stages before the Houses: Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill 2002 [Seanad] and the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 [Seanad]. In addition, the Redundancy (Amendment) Bill was published today and it is my intention to seek to have it passed by the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is also my intention to publish the following two Bills this month, with a view to early passage: Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Contracts) Bill and the Employments Permits Bill. I also want to publish the heads of the Bill to place the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on a statutory basis. My Department will continue to progress the other commitments in the Government's legislation programme to Bill stage. I am also strongly committed to achieving a high level of transposition of EU directives that require to be transposed by my Department.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The FÁS safe pass training scheme, which provides a basic safety training certificate, is being made mandatory on a phased basis and will apply to all building industry employees from 1 June 2003. The only exemptions will be workers from Northern Ireland and the UK, who hold similar current registration cards in respect of schemes which FÁS recognises as being of an equivalent standard to safe pass. All new projects commenced after 1 May 2002 are required to ensure that all staff employed on construction work on the site hold a current safe pass card. So far, more than 200,000 workers have been trained on the safe pass scheme. Inspection of safe pass cards is a routine aspect of site visits and there have been 1,300 construction site visits this year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The new procedures introduced on 9 April 2003 do not affect applications in respect of Montessori school teachers. It is the policy of the Department that employers should seek to employ an Irish-EEA national before applying for a work permit in respect of a non-EEA national. As evidence of this it is necessary to advertise with FÁS. Where the FÁS assessment is that, in light of experience, specific skills are not available on the Irish or wider EEA labour markets, the four week advertising period may be waived. Applications for permits will not be accepted without the appropriate documentation from FÁS.Information regarding occupational categories which are currently regarded as ineligible for work permits may be obtained from the Departments web site at www.entemp.ie.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The responsibility of Government in relation to prices of goods and services generally is, in the main, limited to ensuring that markets are working properly for the benefit of consumers and of the economy as a whole. I am not aware of any particular difficulties in the market referred to in the question and, accordingly, one would expect any lower costs for suppliers to impact favourably on prices for the final consumer.To assist consumers to take advantage of competition and to shop around for the best price there is a legal requirement under the Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order 1997 for retailers to display the selling price of petrol and diesel per litre to consumers. The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is charged with responsibility for monitoring compliance with this order.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I have noted the movements in the recently published consumer price index and wholesale price index to which the Deputy refers. Wholesale prices of goods supplied to retailers are only one component of the final retail price. It may be that movements in other components of cost at retail level are responsible for the apparent divergence between wholesale and retail prices generally. The matter will require further examination and I have requested my Department to pursue this in connection with Forfás which is currently carrying out analytical work on inflation generally.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	625	Any vacancies that were advertised with FÁS in relation to a possible work permit application prior to 9 April 2003 and later submitted to the Department will be considered in the normal way. Applications for renewals of existing work permits, where the employee is being retained by his or her employer, will not be affected by the new restrictions, subject to compliance by the employer with employment rights legislation.

Support provided by FÁS has been through FÁS community services where the community employment programme is the major element – where RAPID areas continue to be prioritised – FÁS employment services, the local employment service and FÁS training services.The estimated value of the FÁS community services activities associated with each relevant RAPID area, which is funded from FÁS existing resources, is as follows: Dublin, €13.8 million; Cork, €6.96 million; Limerick, €2.65 million; Total  €23.41 million.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The Government has decided to replace the Gulfstream IV and the Beechcraft King Air in the ministerial air transport role. The decision was necessary to meet the ever-increasing demands of Government business, not least in the context of a significantly enlarged European Union. The tender competitions for the acquisition of the aircraft are now in train. The closing date for the receipt of tenders for both competitions is 30 May 2003.The tender competitions allow for the submission of both new and pre-owned aircraft. All options, such as outright purchase, lease, lease purchase or other alternatives, will be considered. The highly competitive nature of the aviation market at present should result in competitive packages being offered. In tandem with proposals for the supply of the aircraft, tenderers may also outline offers for the Gulfstream IV aircraft as at the proposed date of hand-over of the tendered aircraft or in mid-July 2004, following the EU Presidency. Offers for the Beechcraft King Air will also be considered in tandem with proposals for its replacement.The acquisition of the aircraft will be the subject of detailed cost benefit analysis, including value for money and comparison with costs associated with alternative arrangements. The responses to the tender process will determine the most advantageous system of payment. The actual cost of the acquisition of the aircraft can only be defined after the tender competition, particularly in view of the fact that pre-owned aircraft are a consideration.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The Deputy will be aware that, in the context of the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided to decentralise the Civil Defence branch of my Department to Roscrea in County Tipperary. The Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision of official accommodation for Departments, is currently considering a number of expressions of interest from developers and property owners in providing such accommodation in Roscrea for the decentralised Civil Defence branch.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I assume the Deputy is referring to bodies under the aegis of my Department in respect of which appointments arise through my Department. There are four such bodies. The Civil Defence Board may have up to 14 members, including the chairperson. I have, as Minister for Defence, made 14 appointments to the board since 6 June 2002. The term of office of the current members expires on 5 June 2005.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	631	My Department is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for persons with disabilities and to the policies that apply across the Civil Service generally with regard to the code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service.The Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners is responsible for the recruitment of personnel into the Civil Service and assigns personnel to individual Departments and offices, including my Department. A limited number of appointments are filled directly by my Department, including those of services officer, services attendant, night-watchman and cleaner. In addition, a number of civilians are employed with the Defence Forces at military barracks and are mainly engaged in building work and maintenance and on clerical, domestic and other duties. The percentage of civil servants with a disability employed in the Department is currently 4.1% and the percentage of civilians employed by the Department with the Defence Forces throughout the country is currently 2.3%.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	632	It is my intention that the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002, which was published in January 2002, will be before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer Dáil recess. It is also anticipated that the heads of a Bill in respect of the new legislation promised for the Curragh of Kildare will be submitted for Government approval before the end of September 2003. As regards the Civil Defence Act 2002, it is my intention to effect an order in the near future formally establishing the Civil Defence Board and giving effect to the remaining provisions of the Act.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	633	On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the reserve, which had reported to me in September 1999. The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are currently being prepared within each brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of proposed newly amalgamated units, but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops, we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the reserve, a better overall organisation structure and opportunities for suitably qualified reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the Army.I am mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread.A final decision on the amalgamation of FCA units will not take place until the end of June. However, the General Officer Commanding the Western Brigade has proposed the amalgamation of the 18th infantry battalion with the 25th infantry battalion and a consequent reduction in the number of companies. This proposal will in effect concentrate efforts and training resources in Athenry. The Reserve Defence Force will remain a vibrant part of the community in the Athenry area. No Reserve Defence Force location will be closed and no member of the RDF will be asked or required to terminate their service.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I assume the Deputy is referring to the draft proposal for a Council directive on Community measures for the control of foot and mouth disease which is currently being discussed at EU level.My position is that vaccination should be used or required to be used only following consultation with the member states and with the consent of the affected member state, and having regard to the economic impact of alternative strategies for dealing with the disease. I have articulated my views on this issue on a number of occasions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers.The free circulation of milk and meat products from vaccinated animals within the EU has the potential to impact on Irelands third country exports. This aspect of the proposal will shortly be the subject of further discussion with member states and, for the reasons already mentioned, I will continue to advocate a precautionary approach in relation to produce from vaccinated animals.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	635	I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.The document endorsed by Ministers at the September 2002 meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council set a number of target dates for achieving progress towards convergence of northern and southern animal health policies. Since September 2002, the various policy groups and the steering committee established under North-South arrangements have taken forward a number of initiatives with a view to policy convergence and enhanced co-operation. In addition, discussions have been held with the British authorities concerning the external arrangements.Detailed work of comparing, reviewing and, where appropriate, adjusting policies is ongoing. Where there has been slippage in the deadlines, the principal reasons are the extent of prior consultation required, the lead-in times needed in respect of any policy changes and the necessity, in some instances, for legislative changes.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	636	Payment will issue shortly to the persons named.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	638	I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 209 together.The issue of the 20% balancing payment under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 30 April 2003. To date more than 55,000 farmers representing 88% of applicants have received over €37 million in balancing payments. It is estimated that the amount outstanding to some 9,000 farmers is approximately €10 million. The delay in issuing the balancing payments arose due to the requirement to apply penalties across all bovine premium schemes with effect from the 2002 scheme year and also because of problems with the overshoot of the special beef premium national quota. While the requirement to apply penalties across all bovine premium schemes under amending Regulation 2419/2001 will mean later balancing payments for 2002 and future years, the penalties that will be applied to the bovine schemes for irregularities and late lodgment of area aid applications will be much lighter than those that applied up to now.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	639	The herd of the person concerned is due for its annual round test in August 2003.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	640	The person named submitted an application for EU special beef premium on 5 December 2002 in respect of four bulls. The applicant was informed that the first day on which these animals could be sold was 6 February 2003. However, during processing it was noted that two of the four animals were slaughtered during the retention period, on 16 December 2002. In accordance with the regulations governing the bovine schemes, no special beef premium is payable in respect of the two animals and a reduction penalty will be applied in respect of the remaining eligible bovine scheme animals qualifying for payment in 2002. Advance payments of special beef premium and slaughter premium have issued to the person named. Moneys overpaid will be recouped from future payments.The person named has been informed of his right to a review of this decision.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	641	There is no record in the quota section of my Department at Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, of a letter having been received from the person named. In fact the quota section in Castlebar wrote to the person named on 6 February 2003 requesting a planners recalculation of his ewe destocking under the commonage framework plan as he indicated earlier that he would consult with a planner to have my Departments calculation reviewed. No response has been received from him to date, despite a contact name and address having been provided in the relevant letter.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	642	Some 97% of applicants under the 2002 area based compensatory allowance scheme and 98% of applicants under the 2002 ewe premium scheme have been paid. Advance payments of 80% have been made to 98% of 2002 suckler cow applicants. The issue of the 20% balancing payments under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 30 April 2003. To date over 55,000 farmers representing 88% of applicants have received over €37 million in balancing payments.The delay in issuing the balancing payments arose due to the requirement to apply penalties across all bovine premium schemes with effect from the 2002 scheme year and also because of problems with the overshoot of the special beef premium national quota.

The tribunal is a body established to consider applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. Details of the 2003-04 scheme will be announced later this year and application forms will be available from co-operatives and from milk policy division, Department of Agriculture and Food, Kildare Street, Dublin 2.While every application is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner, the amount of quota available for allocation is limited in the context of the large numbers of applications that are submitted and therefore the tribunal is not always in a position to recommend the allocation of quota to an applicant.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	644	A penalty of 20% of his annual payment was imposed on the person named because in the course of a compliance inspection his farm boundaries were found not to be stockproofed, as is required under the specifications of the rural environment protection scheme. A letter explaining the penalty and affording him the right of local appeal issued to him on 8 April last and he was invited to put forward by 23 April any explanation as to why the penalty should not be applied. No reply was received. My Department then wrote to him on 2 May notifying him formally of the imposition of the penalty and of his right to appeal directly to the agriculture appeals office.

The named person was the lessor of a milk quota leased with land. That lease is subject to an application made on 12 March 2003 by the lessee in accordance with Regulation 9 for the purchase of the quota.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	646	The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. It also examines applications from producers whose herds have been restricted by animal disease. The tribunal has concluded its work on the hardship and animal disease applications for the 2002-03 milk quota year and all quota available for those categories in that year has been allocated. Details of the 2003-04 schemes will be announced later this year and application forms will be available from co-operatives and from milk policy division, Department of Agriculture and Food, Kildare Street, Dublin 2.In the 2002-03 milk quota year the tribunal also considered appeals by producers under the 32 million litre scheme which was put in place to allocate the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium scale milk producers who satisfied certain criteria. Approximately five million litres is yet to be allocated under this scheme. The work on assessing the approximately 1,800 appeals arising from the scheme will be completed in the near future and all appellants will then be advised of the outcome in their case.

However, a decision on the appeal lodged by the person concerned to the earlier decision taken by the district veterinary office will be finalised this week. A letter will then issue to the person concerned outlining the position.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	648	A strategic review of the dairy processing sector was commissioned and jointly funded by my Department, Enterprise Ireland and the dairy industry itself. This major consultancy study was undertaken by Prospectus and Promar International. The report was published on 19 March and has been broadly welcomed by the industry.A key recommendation of the report is the urgent need for major consolidation and rationalisation at producer and processor level to achieve the scale and cost competitiveness necessary to continue to successfully compete for international business. The need to increase scale and efficiency is not a new issue within the dairy industry and a number of reports previously published have indicated the need for consolidation. There has been considerable movement in this direction in competitor countries in recent years and the Irish dairy industry must respond to ensure that it remains competitive on international markets. I am currently discussing the recommendations of the report with the processing industry.While the report did not focus on production at farm level, it is the case that there will be an increasing need for upsizing at this level also, as has been happening throughout the country including the west, where the policy of ring fencing has applied. I will continue to assist committed active producers to expand and develop their enterprises to an optimal level.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	649	The milk quota restructuring scheme is now the main means by which milk quota is acquired by producers. New and recent entrants to dairying are among the priority categories for the allocation of quota. Details of the 2003-04 restructuring scheme were published in April.I decided that from the 2003-04 quota year a young person who forms a partnership with his/her parent, and where that partnership is registered as a new entrant/parent milk production partnership, he/she may, provided certain conditions are satisfied, qualify for an allocation as a new entrant farming partnership. This would allow the young person to commence milk production using the facilities at the home farm. This will provide opportunities for young committed producers who possess the training and expertise to make a positive contribution to the sector.If the person named is interested in applying to purchase quota under this scheme he should contact his co-op/milk purchaser directly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	650	The person named submitted three applications under the 2002 special beef premium scheme, as follows: two animals on 16 January 2002, 55 animals on 2 December 2002 and two animals on 24 December 2002. One animal on the second application died during the retention period and has been deleted without penalty.In accordance with the regulations governing the bovine schemes, no special beef premium is payable in respect of seven animals on the second application that were not registered on the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, to the person named at the time of application and a reduction penalty will be applied in respect of the remaining eligible bovine scheme animals qualifying for payment in 2002. Advance payments of special beef premium have issued in respect of 51 animals.Advance payment of slaughter premium has issued in respect of 47 animals.The person named sought a review of the decision to apply the reduction penalty.

The UK authorities are considering changes to the OTMS from 1 January 2004. A decision is not expected until after July 2003.The impact on the beef market of a change to the OTMS is being monitored by my Department and An Bord Bia. Until a decision is made on the date and form of any change to the scheme its impact on Irelands beef trade with the UK cannot be fully assessed. The negative effect of any change to the OTMS on trade patterns in 2004 will however be mitigated by the substantial reduction in EU beef intervention stocks in 2003 and the return to a more balanced overall EU market.

Neither was that quota accepted into the temporary leasing scheme. In accordance with the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations 2000 (SI 94 of 2000) which set out the procedure for dealing with dormant milk quotas, the person named was notified on 31 July 2002 of the Department's proposal to add his quota to the national reserve. He was informed that if he did not agree with this proposal he could make observations in writing within 30 days. When a response was not received, a reminder issued on 25 October 2002 allowing a further seven days for observations. My Department has no record of having received a copy of the correspondence which the Deputy has attached. The contents of that correspondence as now presented however, do not give any specific reasons to justify an exemption from the normal rules relating to dormant quota.If the person named can put forward such reasons he should do so as quickly as possible and my Department will consider the matter. I would add that in the event of dormant quota being surrendered to the national reserve it can be returned at a future date if the producer resumes milk production.

Initially, the action taken was a ban on telephone-fax queries and since 25 March this escalated to include the non-performance of counter duties in the afternoons.The CPSU had divided the country into four regions and the industrial action was to rotate between the regions on a weekly basis. As the action taken constituted a refusal to perform their core duties, my Department had no option but to remove staff from the payroll in the region undertaking the action.To date, 257 CPSU members have been removed from the payroll. This includes 36 non-local office CPSU members who refused to pass the pickets on our offices. The decision to remove staff from the payroll was not taken lightly. The union members had decided not to perform normal duties arising from phone calls and faxes and duties at reception desks. The services provided from our local offices are essential to the farming community, in particular in the context of cattle movements to factories and marts as well as the various direct payments to farmers.Following on the decision to remove staff from the payroll my Department was advised that with effect from 3 April, CPSU members would be picketing the offices which were the subject of industrial action for that week, Mayo, Galway, Kerry and Limerick and Clonakilty since 28 April.The union are demanding an increase in the number of posts in the staff officer and executive officer grades. The union demand is a cost increasing claim under the social partnership agreement. These agreements specifically preclude such claims and any form of industrial action. Officials from my Department met on 2 April with CPSU representatives but unfortunately no basis for a settlement emerged from this meeting.

At 31 December 2002 there were 127,711 active herd numbers in the State. Farmers with no bovine animals but applying for area aid support payments are issued with numbers in the same format as the herd number in order to administer the various support schemes. The number of herd numbers issued would not necessarily correlate with the number of farmers.

Detailed statistics are not readily available as farmers will normally be in receipt of one or more payments under the various schemes.The position is that, with some minor exceptions, in order to be considered for payment under any of these schemes a farmer must submit an annual area aid declaration to my Department. In 2002, my Department received a total of 126,560 area aid declarations and this is a good indication of the total number of farmers that received these payments in 2002. My Department does not have information in relation to those farmers who, for one reason or another, do not apply for payment under the various schemes.

Specifically in relation to Saudi Arabia, the position is that in December 2000 the Kingdom imposed a temporary ban on the importation of beef and cattle from the EU, including Ireland. Despite intensive efforts to have the market reopened this has not happened to date. It should be noted that Saudi Arabia is not considered to be a traditional market for live cattle from Ireland with 1996 being the last year in which such trade took place.Saudi Arabia, as one of the Gulf States, offers considerable potential for Irish beef and, for this reason, enormous efforts are being made to have the ban lifted. As part of this approach my Department, working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia, hosted a conference on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector last October in Dublin aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region. The conference, which was attended by experts from the Gulf Co-operation Council's food safety committee and included representatives from Saudi Arabia, afforded the visiting experts the opportunity to fully assess the level and effectiveness of Ireland's BSE controls.

The Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the EU Commission on the issue of globalisation. However, it would be fair to say that most Finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal, and believed that it was not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure that satisfactory answers would be given to the many real questions concerning the tax including: the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other – non-taxable – alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.Nevertheless, at a formal ECOFIN meeting on 16 October 2001 it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax. This study, Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation, was published on 14 February 2002. On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that, "While as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated."  In these circumstances, it is not clear what can be gained by my raising the matter further in the fora mentioned in the questions and I do not plan to do so.

Some of the embankments have been constructed at this stage, most notably on the left bank immediately upstream of Drumcondra Bridge and further upstream in Griffith Park. The landscaping of these embankments is due to take place in the next two weeks. The replacement of Woodville Road footbridge is under way and is expected to be completed in June of this year. The construction and raising of some walls has commenced and most of the walls in the vicinity of Drumcondra Bridge will be completed by the end of June. A new wall behind the school on Botanic Avenue will be constructed during the summer holidays. The ground level between the senior citizens' accommodation and Tolka Park has been raised and construction on the wall to support this will commence later this month. The maintenance cleaning of the channel from Distillery Weir to Glasnevin Bridge has been completed.I am informed by my officials that Dublin City Council, which is the contracting authority for the greater Dublin drainage study, which includes a full study on the River Tolka, expects to receive a draft technical report from the consultants, M.C. O'Sullivan & Company later this month. This will require detailed technical examination by the contracting authority and the Office of Public Works. While the draft technical report is being considered the consultants will carry out an evaluation of the issues raised in third party submissions and will also complete a cost-benefit analysis on the recommended scheme. The contracting authority expects a draft final report before the end of July.When the full report is completed, it should provide additional information on the entire catchment of the Tolka and this along with the items in the interim report, which have not yet been implemented, will provide the basis on which decisions will be made on further flood alleviation measures. Decisions on the provision of funding for a flood relief scheme on the catchment can only be made when the final report has been fully examined.The Office of Public Works is funding the Tolka element of the greater Dublin strategic drainage study at a cost of €870,000. The total cost of the works being implemented in the Dublin city area of the Tolka is expected to be in the region of €700,000. The Office of Public Works also provided €5 million towards the humanitarian aid scheme following the severe flooding in November 2002, a large part of which was paid out to victims of flooding in the Dublin area from the River Tolka.

The exemption is only available to individuals who are resident here for tax purposes.Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, formerly section 2 of the 1969 Finance Act, allows the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination, under guidelines drawn up by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, and the Arts Council, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, that certain works are original and creative, and generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Earnings derived from such works are exempt from income tax.Under the terms of section 195, the Revenue Commissioners can make determinations in respect of works in the following categories: (a) a book or other writing; (b) a play; (c) a musical composition; (d) a painting or other like picture; and (e) a sculpture.Performing artists, such as actors, are not listed as a specified category within section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and therefore, the artists exemption is not currently available to them. I have no plans at present to include performing artists in the artists exemption scheme.

It follows that when a person receives a gift or inheritance from a co-habiting partner that person is entitled to the Group C threshold amount which currently stands at €22,060. This treatment is consistent with the general law which does not regard couples, who are in a permanent relationship but who decide not to marry or cannot do so for legal reasons, as "man and wife".Where an inheritance comprises a dwelling house, or a share in a dwelling house, section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides an exemption from CAT, subject to certain conditions being satisfied, where the house is inherited from a co-habiting partner. However, this exemption only applies where an inheritance is taken on or after 1 December 1999, which is some three years after the date of the inheritance in the case in question and consequently the exemption does not apply here.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissoners that correspondence was exchanged during May 2002 with the solicitor acting in the case and that the outstanding tax remains due. If there is a difficulty in paying this tax there is a statutory instalment scheme which may be availed of. The CAT code also allows for postponement of payment in certain circumstances where there would otherwise be excessive hardship. In this regard, Revenue states it is prepared to review this case and its capital taxes division should be contacted in order to try to achieve a settlement in the matter.

As these negotiations have yet to be completed, it is not appropriate at this stage to disclose any of the financial or other details relating to the proposed agreement. The Balbriggan development is considered the most suitable by the Department of Foreign Affairs and also, importantly, is regarded as best value for money of the proposals examined.During their search for a property, the Commissioners were offered one green field site in Drogheda.

Recruitment is by way of open competition. All competitions held by the commissioners are advertised in one or more of the national papers and on their website at: www.publicjobs.ie. Application forms, together with all relevant details, are only available when competitions are announced. However, potential candidates can register their interest in a position on the Civil Service Commission website and will then automatically be notified by email when the competition is announced.Recruitment to posts within the service is on the basis of qualifications and the ability to carry out the responsibilities of the grade or post. Anyone can apply for a position in the Civil Service but candidates must fulfil the eligibility requirements-criteria of the grade or post being filled. These requirements are set out in the relevant statutory competition regulations.From time to time, individual Departments approach the commissioners to seek an excluding order, under section 5 of the Act, removing a particular post from the scope of the Act so that a temporary appointment can be made. An example of this would be for staff to cover peak periods such as in the Passport Office or examinations section of the Department of Education and Science, or for work on the census.

These payments represent all the DIRT which should have been deducted, together with the related interest and penalties. Accordingly, there were no write-offs of any DIRT liabilities.Revenue made a report on the matter to the Committee of Public Accounts in November 2000.

Similar orders were made for the preparation of sites in Athlone, Tralee and Kildare to accommodate asylum seekers in mobile homes and also for pre-fabricated accommodation at Baleskin, County Dublin. The only ministerial order to be subject to judicial review is in the case of a site at Leggettsrath, County Kilkenny, where it was intended to provide pre-fabricated accommodation for asylum seekers. This case is still before the courts. Two properties – Broc House, Nutley Lane, and Lynch's Lodge, Macroom are currently vacant pending the outcome of separate judicial review proceedings.As I mentioned in my response to Question No. 16 of 8 April the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, through its Reception and Integration Agency, intends to use both properties for the accommodation of asylum seekers subject to the outcome of the judicial review proceedings currently before the courts.

As I have said previously, a wide range of important issues, including the national spatial strategy, have to be considered before a final decision is taken on a new programme of decentralisation. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility. Given the wide range of considerations it is not possible for me to state, at this time, when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on this matter.

The proposed development provides for the removal of two existing staff huts to be replaced with a new single storey detached pavilion consisting of a security office, guide office, accessible toilet and storage area, a new approach pathway, new parking layout for 30 cars and a bicycle stand, two security poles seven metres high with security cameras attached, new landscaping layout, new fencing layout and all ancillary works.On 16 October 2002, Dublin City Council sought further information from the Office of Public Works. It requested an historical assessment of the Casino grounds taking account of the effect that the Office of Public Works's proposal may have on any possible re-instatement of the Casino's former landscape setting. The effect on the archaeological potential of the site was also to be taken into account. In addition, it requested that the Office of Public Works consult jointly with the planning department and conversation office of Dublin City Council prior to lodging this historical landscape assessment.

My aim in making appointments to such bodies is to select people with the required qualities, expertise and experience to make a contribution to the body in question.Details in so far as they are available of future vacancies, excluding ex officio appointments, that are scheduled to arise in the normal course, are set out in the following table:

These discussions are nearing completion. An application for planning permission for the redevelopment of the site will be made before the end of 2003.

Two properties and the site at Leggetsrath, Kilkenny, are currently the subject of judicial review proceedings and consequently cannot be used. The Devereux Hotel is currently under negotiation for disposal and a deal is expected to be finalised by the end of June this year.The total security costs paid to date on these premises are as follows: Broc House, €298,798.34; Lynch's Lodge, €256,813.98; and Devereux Hotel, €269,037.34. As the State carries its own insurance risk there have been no insurance costs on any of the properties.

The Department of Finance is responsible for the operation of the target in the Civil Service, while the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deals with policy for the public service. The 3% target, which was established in 1977, has been a key element of Government policy for people with disabilities. It has provided significant employment opportunities for people with disabilities, which might not otherwise be available.In the Department of Finance, the percentage of staff with a disability employed at present is 3%, or 20 people out of a total staff of 689. The 3% target has been met and sometimes exceeded in my Department every year since 1997 as follows:

The details of the programme are as follows: the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002 is awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil; it is intended to publish the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill during this session; the publication of this Bill was agreed as part of the negotiations on Sustaining Progress.The following Bills expected to be published this year: Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (No 2) Bill; Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) (1956 Act) Bill; and Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill.Other Bills being prepared are as follows: Revenue Bill; Membership of Council of Europe Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Bill; Financial Services (Consolidation) Bill; Dormant Accounts Bill and Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Act 2001 (Amendment) Bill.

It was intended that the lawn would be re-instated as soon as that project was completed. However, it was subsequently decided to construct an underground car park for Leinster House. This involved new landscaping proposals for Leinster Lawn and in view of this it was decided not to incur expenditure on the short-term re-instatement of the lawn pending completion of the underground car park.While the underground car-park project has now been deferred, the refurbishment of Oireachtas office accommodation in Kildare House, including the provision of a crèche and fitness room for Members and staff of the Oireachtas, is imminent. The Kildare House refurbishment necessitates the vacating of the Kildare House car park and pending completion of the refurbishment project, the car parking facilities lost will be provided temporarily on Leinster Lawn. The restoration of Leinster Lawn will be addressed immediately on completion of the Kildare House project.

A balancing statement together with a cheque for this amount is in the process of being issued.In relation to pensions, the inspector needs information about the basis on which a refund might be due. If the taxpayer is making contributions to a pension plan, for instance, he should forward copies of the relevant documentation to the inspector.The inspector wrote to the taxpayer on 6 May 2003 requesting that he forward any details he may have regarding pension contributions. Upon receipt of it he will carry out a review of the taxpayer's liability and issue any further refund which may be due.

The purpose of this measure is to encourage investment in increased nursing home capacity and in improved facilities for the elderly and incapacitated for which there is a growing demand. The Department of Health and Children does not have any figures indicating how many nursing home owners took advantage of the allowance.As the construction and running of private nursing homes is a private venture, the Government does not control where they are to be built. However, when prospective nursing home owners inquire from the Department of Health and Children about setting up a nursing home, the Department refers them to the health board in that area, which is in a better position to advise them of the potential demand for their services in that location.In relation to the fact that there may be a danger of there being a surplus of vacant beds in nursing homes in certain locations, my Department has been informed by the Department of Health and Children that there are a number of reasons this may be the case, including the fact that specialised medical facilities may not be available in certain nursing homes to cater for a particular patient who may otherwise have resided in that home. There are also geographical reasons as to why certain nursing homes may be unsuitable for potential residents, who very often prefer to reside in nursing homes close to relatives and friends.

A copy of the most recent statistical report for 2001 was placed in the Oireachtas Library.The Deputy will be aware that in 2002 the Revenue Commissioners carried out a study on the effective tax rates of the top 400 income recipients. A copy of the report of this study is available also in the Oireachtas Library.

Due to the backlog of persons awaiting assessment by the board it has not been possible to offer the person an appointment for assessment as yet. I am advised by the board that, while it has not as yet set a date for its next meeting, the person referred to is due to be offered an appointment for that meeting and will be advised accordingly as soon as a date has been agreed.

Therefore, the question of consulting with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this issue does not arise.The issues of asylum and refugee protection are considered, at an intergovernmental level within the UN system, by the executive committee of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which meets on an annual basis in Geneva and of which Ireland is a member.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	700	I am aware of the reported incident from some media reports. However, I have been advised that a display of the national flag by a few individuals, as described by the Deputy, would not involve a breach of international law. Consequently, I do not think it requires action on our part.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The most recent session of the trial took place from 7 to 11 April. The Irish ambassador to Colombia acted as official representative at this session and his report has been considered carefully in my Department. As the trial is continuing, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the proceedings at the present time.The next session of the trial has been scheduled for Monday 16 June. My Department will continue to follow this case closely and to provide all possible consular assistance to the men.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	702	While it has not yet proved possible to overcome the obstacles that would allow for the early restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, demonstrable progress has been made over recent months in advancing the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. These advances are reflected in the joint declaration and associated documents published by both Governments on 1 May.Following the meeting of the Taoiseach and Prime Minister in Dublin on 6 May, both governments have agreed that those aspects of the joint declaration that are not contingent on acts of completion by others will now be taken forward. These include the key areas of policing, criminal justice, equality, human rights and some aspects of security normalisation. The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference will have an important role to play in reviewing the process of implementation of the joint declaration.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I share the Deputy's concern about the human rights and humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo arising from the conflict in that country.I have condemned the appalling massacre of civilians that took place on 3 April in the area of Drodro, near Bunia, in the eastern province of Ituri. A UN team comprising representatives of the UN peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and representatives of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is conducting an investigation to determine responsibility for this shocking act. The team is expected to report on its findings within the coming weeks. Early indications suggest that the final death toll may be less than the originally feared, 1,000 deaths. However, this in no way detracts from the enormity of the crime. Indiscriminate violence and murder has become a feature of life in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and this latest atrocity underscores the need to address impunity in the country. The report of the investigation will, in due course, be considered at the United Nations, and Ireland will play closest attention to its follow-up.The inauguration, on 4 April, of the Ituri Pacification Commission, under the chairmanship of the UN Secretary General's Deputy Special Representative to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is an important step towards restoring some semblance of peace and security in Ituri. The commission comprises representatives of the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Angola, the UN mission, civil society and political and military parties to the conflict in Ituri. It is charged with establishing an acceptable structure to maintain law and order and to assure the total withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the area. The UN has now deployed 200 military observers to the area to help stabilise the security situation.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	704	The UN fund for population activities, UNFPA, which is supported by 119 countries, is the largest multilateral source of assistance on population issues for developing countries. The needs in this area are acute: it is estimated that some half a million women in the developing world die each year due to pregnancy-related causes and that 350 million women have no access to any form of contraception. In 2003, Ireland Aid has committed €2.539 million to support UNFPA's core resources which are focused primarily on the world's poorest countries.UNFPA is committed by its mandates to the principles of voluntarism and all of its programmes of assistance throughout the world are based on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. Its guiding policy, as laid down by its governing council in 1985, stipulates that UNFPA is, "not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services and abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning".In recent years, there have been a number of allegations that UNFPA has supported coercive family planning programmes and/or abortion. Many of these allegations have been made by the Population Research Institute, a private body based in the United States. In response to representations from Ireland, the fund has categorically denied all of these allegations and insisted that it continues to abide by its mandate. In the case of China, a number of independent investigations have taken place into allegations made against UNFPA. All of these investigations have confirmed that UNFPA does not support China's one-child policy and is making an important contribution to encouraging the Chinese authorities away from coercive family planning measures.Ireland served a three-year term on the executive board on UNFPA from 1998-2000 and was closely involved in discussions on UNFPA's policies and programmes. We were impressed by the quality of UNFPA's development activities, the commitment of its staff and the support it provides to some of the world's poorest countries. Ireland Aid continues to monitor UNFPA closely and attends all of the executive board meetings of the organisation. Over the past year, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, has had a number of meetings with Ms Thoraya Obaid, the executive director of the fund, to discuss our contribution and the fund's activities.Health is, and will continue to be, a major priority for Ireland Aid. Supporting UNFPA is just one part of this approach. For example, one of UNFPA's key tasks is to contribute to the implementation of the millennium development goal of reducing the maternal mortality rate by 75% by 2015. UNFPA's programmes also have a major focus on the fight against HIV/AIDS – one of the biggest challenges facing developing countries and an overarching priority of Ireland's development assistance.However, Ireland Aid also contributes bilaterally and multilaterally and through NGOs and missionaries towards improving health in developing countries. Approximately 20% of programme expenditure in the priority countries of Ireland Aid; Ethiopia, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda and Timor Leste is directed to the health sector.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I would like to thank the Deputy for drawing these cases to my attention. Under Article 20 of the UN Convention Against Torture, the Committee Against Torture can consider communications which contain well founded indications that torture is being systematically practised in the territory of a state party to the convention. Also under this convention, Article 22 provides that individuals can complain directly or through representatives to the committee, where they are the alleged victims of violations of the convention.China is a state party to the UN Convention Against Torture and accordingly, under Article 2 of the convention, it has an obligation to take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction. However, in respect of Articles 20 and 22 of the convention referred to above, China has made a reservation stating that it does not recognise the competence of the Committee Against Torture as provided for in Article 20, and has not made the necessary declaration accepting the competence of the committee to consider individual complaints under Article 22.The Government believes that torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment are among the most abhorrent violations of human rights and human dignity. Ireland calls on all countries to uphold their obligations under international human rights instruments to which they are party, in particular the UN Convention Against Torture.Ireland is committed to working for the prevention and eradication of all such violations of human rights. We voice our concerns wherever possible, including in international fora such as the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights. At the recently concluded 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Ireland, along with our EU partners, co-sponsored a resolution condemning all acts of torture.

The inspection mission is at present in abeyance as a result of the decision by the United States and others to resort to the use of military force in Iraq. However, the resolution remains valid and the work of the weapons inspectors remains to be completed. It is for the Security Council to decide how best to address the issues remaining within the remit of Resolution 1441. The Government believes that it would be in the best interests of all if the weapons inspectors were to complete their mission.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	707	In July 2002, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed the Pretoria Agreement, which saw the full withdrawal of Rwandan troops from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In August 2002, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a similar agreement – the Luanda Agreement – which paved the way for a reduction of Ugandan troops to just two battalions providing local security in the Ituri region, with a commitment to withdraw fully as soon as the security situation permitted.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	708	The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made the following nominations and appointments since 6 June 2002: Ireland – United States Commission for Educational Exchange, Fulbright Commission. In August 2002, the Minister for Foreign Affairs re-appointed two of the then current board members for a second term – Professor Pat Fottrell, UCG, chairman; and Dr. Don Thornhill, HEA.In addition, two new Irish members were appointed by the Minister – Professor Joyce O'Connor, president, National College of Ireland; and Professor Brian Hillery, emeritus professor of industrial relations, graduate business school, UCD.The term of office of the present commission runs until July 2004. All four of the current members will be eligible for re-appointment at that time. The other four members are US citizens appointed by the US ambassador to Ireland.During the period referred to by the Deputy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs appointed honorary consuls in Colombo, Istanbul, Los Angeles and Melbourne and honorary consuls general in Bombay and Montreal. As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible to say when vacancies for such appointments will arise.In February 2003, the Minister for Foreign Affairs re-constituted the Joint Department of Foreign Affairs/Non-Governmental Organisations Standing Committee on Human Rights for a period of two years. This involved the appointment of the following 16 nominees to the committee – Ms Neva Khan, GOAL; Ms Aisling Reidy, director, Irish Council of Civil Liberties; Mr. Michael O'Brien, Trócaire; Ms Karen Kenny, International Human Rights Trust; Mr. Cónal O'Caoimh, Comhlámh; Ms Mary Lawlor, director, Frontline; Ms Siobhan Ní Chulácháin, vice-president, Federation International de Droit I'Homme; Ms Anastasia Crickley, chairperson, National Consultative Commission on Racism and Intercuturalism; Ms Angela Kerrins, Rehab Care; Mr. Paul Burns; Mr. Jerome Connolly; Professor Attracta Ingram, department of politics, UCD; Professor William Schabas, director, Irish Centre for Human Rights, NUI; Mr. Hans Zomer, director, Dóchas; Mr. Seán Love, director, Irish section, Amnesty International; and Mr. Paddy McGuinness, assistant chief executive officer, Concern.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	709	As I stated in the House on 29 January last, in reply to a parliamentary question, Ireland supports an independent commission of inquiry into the death of the person referred to in the Deputy's question. Our EU partners share this position and the European Union made a political declaration calling for a full and transparent inquiry on 5 February 2001. I raised the case directly with the Ukrainian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zlenko, when I last met him at the UN General Assembly in New York on 10 November 2001 and my officials raised the case again with the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry in October 2002. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has noted our concerns, which have been repeated by successive EU Presidencies.We will continue to follow closely developments in the case, including developments in multilateral fora such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE. The Council of Europe has played a leading role and the proposal by the Parliamentary Assembly, Recommendation 1538, that an independent commission of inquiry, which would include international investigators, should be established, has won wide support. I am pleased to note that the proposal has the support not only of my colleagues in the committee of Ministers, but also of the OSCE representative on freedom of the media as well as members of the family of the person concerned.

In particular, my Department has sought to ensure that it meets the recommended employment target of 3% for people with disabilities. This year that target has been achieved. My Department has also made structural changes to allow people with disabilities easier access to its buildings.In addition, my Department has a disability liaison officer who supports staff with disabilities and ensures that any specific needs are met.

As things currently stand, it expects to be able to fill all posts there through internal redeployment. If a shortfall arises it will, however, advertise the posts throughout the Civil Service and establish a transfer list. It also advised us, that while there is no transfer list at present for Maynooth, the officer in question is 75th on its transfer list for posts in Naas.

Through our embassy in Abuja, we continue to closely monitor this case and to convey our views in all appropriate ways.

He confirmed that he had suffered a fractured skull, that he was recovering well and that he expected to be in hospital for a further ten days or so. He further confirmed that his family in Ireland were aware of his hospitalisation and that he has medical insurance. The embassy advised him to report the matter to the police immediately. The embassy has also been in contact directly with the police.An official from the embassy made further contact and spoke directly with the individual last Friday and he confirmed that he was recovering and is being well looked after. He further confirmed that he is not encountering any language difficulties with the medical staff as he himself speaks German. I understand that he has reported the incident to the police and an officer has come to the hospital to take a statement.The individual has expressed his appreciation to the embassy for its interest and concern. I can assure the Deputy that the embassy will continue to monitor the case.

Given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position during this year to initiate architectural planning for any further building projects, including the provision of a computer room at Ard Scoil Rís. The project will, however, be considered for the 2004 capital programme.

The 2003 school building programme was recently published and on the basis of the budgetary allocation it was not possible to make provision for any further projects in 2003.The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects, including the proposed project for Shragh national school, that could not be included in this year's programme.In the meantime, individual schools should use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works.

These special rates can range from €370.00 to €589.50 per pupil depending on the particular level of need involved. Children with autism attract the latter rate.My Department does not hold statistics on the numbers of children by disability and it is not possible to say how much has been expended on children with special needs by disability category.Many children at primary school level, with disorders on the autistic spectrum, are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of resource teachers and/or special needs assistants.Where the level of the condition is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities receive the enhanced capitation grants and operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Special needs assistant support is also provided where required. There are currently 115 such classes for pupils with autism in the primary system. These include three special classes for pupils with Asperger's syndrome which is on the autistic spectrum.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his-her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.

A decision on this issue will, however, rest ultimately with the planning authorities.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	726	The Government is committed to providing a full educational psychological service to all schools. The planning group that prepared proposals for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) recommended that 200 psychologists would be needed in the educational system, of whom about 180 would be in NEPS. The planning group also recommended that this target should be achieved over a period of five years and that the psychological service should gradually be expanded to all during that time.The Government decided in early 1999 that the recommendations in the report of the planning group should be implemented. NEPS was therefore established on 1 September 1999 and has been expanding gradually on a national basis over the past few years in accordance with the Government's decision.I am aware that, during this development phase of NEPS, some schools have experienced difficulties in accessing psychological assessments. I have, therefore, provided funding so that those schools that do not yet have direct access to the NEPS service can avail of the scheme for commissioning private assessments, SCPA, which NEPS administers, pending the full expansion of the NEPS service to all schools. This is an interim arrangement and is not a substitute for a full educational psychological service. In the financial year 2002, a total of €1,247,310 was expended on assessments carried out under SCPA and I am committed to funding the continuation of the SCPA scheme to the end of the current school year. In the period January to March 2003, €367,620.00 has been expended on assessments under SCPA. This is an increase of 58% on the same period in 2002, due in part to increased awareness by schools of the existence of SCPA and in part to some enhancements of the scheme.

These procedures were intended to simplify and speed up the application and allocation process. When these new procedures were introduced, it was agreed that a review of their operation would take place later in the year. That review is now taking place in a small number of selected mainstream primary and post-primary schools. The review focuses on the current provision of special needs assistants in the selected schools and their deployment. It also studies whether the appointment procedures followed were in keeping with the terms of circular 7/2002 and the adequacy of the special need assistant provision in meeting the special care needs of the children for whom it was sought. It is expected that the outcome of the review will be available by the end of the current school year and that its findings can begin to be implemented thereafter.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	728	In early 2000, the joint review group on psychology services recommended a significant increase, from less than 20 to approximately 50, in the number of postgraduate training places in order to bring about an improved balance between the supply and demand for professionally qualified clinical psychologists. The three year doctorate of psychological science in clinical psychology, DPsychSc, in Trinity College Dublin is jointly funded by TCD and the Northern Area Health Board. In July 2001, the university reached an agreement with the Northern Area Health Board, which provides for 12 post graduate places per year, increased from six. There are 12 students in year two in the current academic year, with a further 12 students who started year one in January 2003. The three year doctorate of psychological science in clinical psychology in UCD allows for an increased intake from six to ten students per annum for two years, followed by a fallow year. At present, there are ten students in year two, nine in year three and there was no intake in 2002-03 as it is the fallow year. There will be a further intake in 2003-04.In September 2000, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, invited proposals across the health services for the provision of funding for 30 places in 2001-02. As a result, funding in respect of course fees was given to the Psychological Society of Ireland for the running of their part-time postgraduate diploma. NUI Galway will begin a new three year doctorate in clinical psychology programme in September 2003. The proposed intake will be 12 per annum. The new programme has been advertised widely and NUIG has begun its student selection process.

The question of permanent recognition will be considered when the Department is satisfied that the long-term viability of the school has been demonstrated and that the school is operating in accordance with the rules for national schools. Until such time as permanent recognition is granted, the school will not be considered for capital grant aid either for site acquisition, or for the construction of permanent school accommodation. If and when permanent recognition is granted, budgetary factors will then determine the rate of progress on the delivery of permanent accommodation for the school.

As I have indicated previously, I expect that the outcome of the review by my officials will provide me with a range of possible options which will seek to ensure that the available funding is targeted in a manner which achieves maximum impact from the point of view of equity of access to third level education. When I have had an opportunity to consider the contents of the review I will bring the matter to Cabinet. Following its consideration by Government, I will make a determination as regards publication and consultation arrangements, as appropriate. I recognise the need to avoid, as far as possible, uncertainty for students and their parents. In any event, it is my intention to decide shortly as to the arrangements and support provisions which will be in place for students for the 2003-04 academic year.

In fact, the opposite is the case. I have committed myself to providing the maximum possible information on an ongoing basis through the publication of the entire school building programme earlier this year and through the provision of updated information on the Department website.The 2003 school building programme, which I published in January, is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students and to give an assurance that it is being operated in an open and transparent manner. I hope it will reassure everybody that the building programme and the projects proposed are selected on the basis of objective criteria which I also published for the first time. It is my intention to further develop this use of my Department's website as a means of communicating information to schools and other interested parties regarding the school building programme. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that an updated version of the 2003 school building programme will be on my Department's website in the very near future.I am not in a position to advise Deputies when projects listed in the programme will progress as the budgetary allocation for capital investment in schools for 2004 and subsequent years has yet to be determined.

Numbers have dropped from 23 pupils in 1993-94 to seven in 2001-02 and the same number in the current year 2002-03.Rule 36 of the Rules for National Schools states: "Aid is not continued to a school at which the average daily enrolment falls below eight units for two consecutive school years."  A decision to close the school under rule 36, was taken after consultation with the patron, and the local schools' inspector. In taking this decision my Department was cogniscant of the fact that there are insufficient numbers of pre-school children in the area to ensure the continued viability of the school and the fact that the pupils currently attending Doaghbeg N.S. can be accommodated at other schools in the parish.In view of the above, the decision of the planning section of my Department remains unchanged.

The school authorities have applied for permanent recognition and the application is currently under consideration in the planning section of my Department. This matter will be finalised when all the relevant details have been received and considered. In the meantime the school is not entitled to capital grant aid.During the period of provisional recognition it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and the Department is in a position to acquire a site and provide a permanent school building. My Department grant-aids the rental cost of such temporary accommodation at the rate of 75% for schools having provisional recognition and at the rate of 95% for schools with permanent recognition.It is open to the management authorities of the gaelscoil in Ballina to apply to my Department for grant-aid in respect of the rental of additional temporary accommodation to cater for anticipated increased enrolments at the school next September. Such application will be considered in the light of current budgetary constraints and competing demands on my Departments rental budget.The position regarding funding for new primary schools generally is set out in the document Recognition for New Primary Schools' Funding, which is available on my Department's website at, www.education.ie.

It was subsequently published in March 2002 and is available from the Government Publications Sales Office. The report of the task force in question contains approximately 180 recommendations, ranging from measures aimed at identifying prevalence rates and early intervention, through issues relating to diagnosis and assessment, the centrality of the role of parents, the required models of education and health care services and the need for specialist training for those involved in service provision, to structural, constitutional and policy issues.My Department's key focus to date has been on progressing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development of services for persons with autism in line with the task force's recommendations.A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the national council for special education. The national council, which will have a local presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including persons with autism. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. A chief executive was appointed to the council recently and it is intended that the council will be vested shortly.It is also my intention to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to copper-fasten the rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities, including persons with autism. The objective of this leglisation, which will be based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, will be to provide a statutory basis for education services for persons with disabilities, including persons with autism. The Bill will provide a clear and enforceable statement in law of the rights of children and adults who, because of disabilities, have special educational needs.

Each school is allowed to commission a specified number of assessments, the number being related to the size of the school population. The school principal, in consultation with the teaching staff, determines which children should have priority for psychological assessment.The school attended by the pupil named by the Deputy is one of the schools that have access to SCPA. I understand from NEPS that this school is entitled to four assessments under the SCPA in the current school year. According to NEPS records, the school has arranged for one assessment to date. Arrangements for the assessment, including the timing of it, are a matter for discussion between the child's parents, the school principal, and the psychologist from the SCPA panel.

On the basis of the budgetary allocation it was not possible to make provision for the acquisition of a site for St Brigid's, the Coombe, in 2003. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects, including site acquisitions, that could not be included in this year's programme.

Department officials have met and formally advised the chairperson of the boards of management of St. Joseph's Special School and Pobalscoil Rosmíní of the position. The Drumcondra authorities have been requested, also, to review the scope to develop St. Joseph's as a co-educational special school for the visually impaired from September next. A formal response in that regard is awaited. My officials will continue to keep the parent referred to by the Deputy and the national parents body, FÉACH, advised of developments.

One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. This scheme was superseded in the 1992 PESP agreement by a more extensive grant scheme, now referred to as the ancillary services grant. The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard per capita grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Abbeydorney national school receives funding under this scheme.The level of funding provided to schools by my Department in respect of ancillary services has increased from €102 per pupil in 2002 to €127 per pupil in 2003 –€63.50 per pupil per service. Based on an enrolment figure of 82 pupils on 30 September last, Abbeydorney national school received a grant of €10,414 in respect of secretarial and caretaking services for 2003.

The Department has sanctioned a special needs assistant to facilitate the child's enrolment. I understand that the school has arranged for a nurse to be available to provide for the child's medical needs. School transport arrangements are being explored by the school. I understand, however, the child has not yet presented for enrolment in St. Patrick's. The family is advised to contact the school to indicate if they intend availing of the placement.

The 2003 school building programme has now been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on my Department's website, www.education.ie. While a consultant architect has carried out a feasibility study on the school, my Department does not intend to put further large scale projects, including St. Mary's national school, into architectural planning during 2003. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on applications and projects that could not be included in this year's programme. In the meantime, individual schools should use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works.

My Department operates an automatic response to applications for special needs assistant support to enable schools to cater for children with special needs, once these needs are confirmed through assessments by relevant professionals. It is open to the management authorities of the school in question to submit an application for such support to my Department, having regard to the Department's criteria and procedures for special needs resource allocation.

The child has been in receipt of four hours per week resource tuition since June 2002. Following a review of the application by the national educational psychological service, the school was advised by my Department in April 2003 that the extra supports sought could not be sanctioned. The application did not comply with the requirements of Department Circular 08/2002 for an increase in resource teaching support or the requirements of Department Circular 07/2002 for the sanctioning of special needs assistant support. The child continues to receive four hours per week resource tuition.

The programme shows that €18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant.The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant, €12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of €3,809 to each school and €5.6 million for payment of the per capita element, at €12.70 per pupil. The published programme also makes clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools would be undertaken and this review is currently under way. Its purpose is to ensure that the best use is made of the funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with recommendations that may arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years. It is intended to complete the review before the end of the current school year.

Where asbestos requiring removal is detected, either as a result of the survey or otherwise, arrangements to undertake the work in accordance with the relevant health and safety legislation are made by the Office of Public Works. Previous air test results for asbestos at St. Killian's national school were found to be clear. The advice to my Department from the health and safety unit of the Office of Public Works is that removal is not necessary in the case of St. Killian's.

These proposed projects are at an early stage of architectural planning and have been assigned a "band 2" rating, with the exception of Fore national school which has been assigned a "band 3" rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large scale projects. The proposed large scale building project for Dalystown national school is also listed in section 7 of the programme and has been assigned a "band 3" rating.Projects listed in sections 6 and 7 – primary – are not being authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning for the time being. The question of when projects listed in these sections can progress to tender and construction will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the band rating. In view of the scale of the 2003 school building programme as published, and having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, my Department will not be in a position to initiate architectural planning on any further large scale building projects in 2003, including the proposed projects at Castledaly national school and Sonna national school. In the meantime, individual schools should use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	776	The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The enrolment of the school in question has decreased from 50 pupils on 30 September 2001 to 46 pupils on 30 September 2002. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and one mainstream class teacher for the 2003-04 school year.As the agreed appointment figure for the second mainstream class teacher is 50 pupils, there is no basis on which my Department may sanction an additional teaching post in the school. In August 2002, I established an independent appeals board to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. A circular outlining the staffing schedule for the coming school year and the appeal procedures has recently issued to all primary schools. The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2003-04 school year was considered by the appeals board on 9 April 2003. I understand that the board of management of the school was notified of the decision on 10 April 2003.

It is also provided to pupils who are awaiting an appropriate educational placement. I understand from my officials that ten hours per week home tuition was sanctioned for the children referred to by the Deputy until the end of the current school year. I further understand that following a recent review of home tuition cases, my officials became aware that the pupils in question were enrolled in a special junior school catering for pupils with autism, where each class has a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and two special needs assistants. Consequently, the home tuition was withdrawn with effect from the end of April.

From September 2000 to June 2001, €2.28 million was spent on the home tuition scheme. A total of €3.92 million was spent on the scheme for the 2001-02 school year. The cost for the 2002-03 school year is estimated to be in the region of €6.13 million.The home tuition scheme is intended to provide compensatory instruction to pupils with a medical ailment that is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school on a continuing basis. It is also utilised in instances where specific types of tuition are recommended by educational psychologists that may not be available in mainstream or special classes locally and until a suitable school placement can be arranged. The scheme is also used to fund tuition during the month of July for children with autistic spectrum disorders and severe or profound general learning disabilities who have specific needs and are not receiving school-based teaching due to school holidays. The cost of the July provision was in the region of €74,500 in 2001, €287,500 in 2002 and more than €363,500 for July 2003. I have no plans to change the scheme at this time.

The school authorities were advised that the question of permanent recognition would be considered when the Department was satisfied that long-term viability had been demonstrated and that the school was operating in accordance with the rules for national schools. Until such time as permanent recognition is granted to the school, my Department will not consider the purchase of a site to permanently accommodate the school. If and when permanent recognition is granted, budgetary factors will then determine the rate of progress on the acquisition of a site and on the delivery of permanent accommodation for the school.

This consists of €1.6 million on activities including capital projects, broadening third level access and adult and community education, plus €343,000 on once-off further education projects. It has given more than €5 million, under the Back to Education initiative to vocational education committees which encompass RAPID areas. It is not possible to desegregate this total on an individual RAPID area basis due to the difficulty in identifying the specific schemes that have been approved under the Back to Education initiative, as this is a matter for individual vocational education committees, as well as the portion of allocations under the school completion programme that relate to proposals from RAPID areas.The current overall position regarding my Department's response to the RAPID programme is as follows. Some 28 RAPID proposals have been approved either in whole or in part at a combined cost of more than €1.6 million. This figure does not include a number of enhanced services for which a costing is not readily available, such as those that involve additional teacher allocations, additional teaching hours, increased access to psychological services, or in the case of capital projects, approval to progress to the next stage of architectural planning. There have been 28 proposals relating to early school leaving or homework clubs, located in areas where allocations have been made under the children at risk fund or where there are SCP "clusters" in existence. The SCP is the Department's main vehicle for funding proposals related to early school leavers. RAPID co-ordinators have been encouraged to liaise with the local management committees of the SCP in order to ensure that their proposals are integrated as far as possible into their cluster's retention plan. While a number of RAPID projects have been incorporated into SCP clusters, it is not possible to specify how much of a cluster's allocation is provided for those individual projects.

The Government has, over the past number of years, introduced a range of measures which have seen considerable advances made in salmon policy and the management of drift net salmon fisheries. As part of these measures, the season is now confined to a two-month period in June and July on a four-day week basis. Fishing is only allowed during daylight hours and is confined to the area within the six-mile limit. The Government also introduced the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme, which limited the total allowable commercial catch of salmon for the first time in 2002.The aim of these measures, which are implemented through the central and regional fisheries boards, is to first and foremost allow adequate spawning stock into our rivers through the establishment and adherence to conservation limits or escapement goals. This ensures that our rivers and lakes can produce juvenile salmon to the maximum of their productive potential, which in turn provides for the maximum return in the future of adult fish to our coastal waters in subsequent years. These conservation limits or escapement goals are set on the advice of the National Salmon Commission's standing scientific committee, which is made up of the most eminent Irish scientists working in the field.The fisheries boards are ensuring the attainment of these escapement goals by regulating exploitation through a system of tags and quotas introduced by the wild salmon and sea trout regulations. Both the scientific advice and the implementation of the tagging scheme are kept under review to ensure their optimum effectiveness. In this regard, my colleague and Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, following the advice of the National Salmon Commission and the consideration of submissions made by interested stakeholders, has recently signed revised wild salmon and sea trout regulations, which set a total allowable catch of 182,000 fish in respect of all commercial salmon fishing in 2003. This represents a 12% cut on the commercial catch in 2002.The salmon commission has further recommended that a three-year strategy should be put in place to ensure, through further progressive reductions, that the conservation limits specified by its standing scientific committee should be reached by 2005. Both I and the Minister of State have already indicated publicly our concurrence with this approach.

As I previously indicated to the House in my reply of 15 April 2003, the annual salmon rod ordinary licence duties were last increased in 1988, while the cost of district, 21-day, one-day and juvenile licences were last increased in 1992. It is my intention that in the future these duties will be adjusted annually in line with the consumer price index.Our fisheries boards provide valuable services to the inland fisheries sector and it is vital that they be assisted in developing their own resource income sources to support their operations. All of the additional revenues to be raised by the increase will be spent by the fisheries boards on the maintenance and protection of fish habitats and stocks and promotion of the inland fisheries resource.

At the time a statement issued by my colleague Minister of State Browne said:Before the size of the accumulation or the possibility of any commercial development can be assessed, a considerable amount of analysis of existing data together with much further appraisal work on the prospect will be required. It is expected that appraisal operations will resume at the earliest opportunity during the drilling season in 2003.These appraisal operations commenced last weekend with the re-entry of the Dooish well 12/2-1 having received the necessary approvals from my Department. Operations on the well, which had to be suspended last October due to poor weather conditions, must be completed and the results analysed before any further assessment can be made of the likely significance of the discovery.Consequent to my approval of a plan to develop the Seven Heads gas field, Ramco Seven Heads Limited, as operator, completed the drilling and testing of the Seven Heads gas development well in the North Celtic Sea Basin using the semi-submersible drilling rig Sedco 711. Drilling commenced on 15 March 2003 and the well was drilled to a total depth of 4260 ft. It was tested and produced dry gas at a maximum rate of 34.3 million cubic feet per day. The well was suspended pending tie-in to the field's subsea facilities and the rig was moved off location on 18 April 2003.

These regulations provide, among other things, for quotas in each of the 17 fishery districts, including the Waterford district, for commercial fishing of wild salmon and sea trout. The quota set for each district was decided by the Minister of State on the advice of the National Salmon Commission, which is representative of all stakeholders in the sector including the snapnet fishermen.Under the revised regulations, the chief executive officer of the regional fisheries board is given the statutory responsibility and accountability to manage and operate the distribution of quotas in each district following consultation with the fishery district committee. The membership of the Waterford fishery district committee is made up of members of the regional fisheries board who are representative of all the commercial fishermen in the district, including the snapnet fishermen. I have asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board to advise the Deputy directly on the details of the operation of the tagging scheme in the Waterford district.

Under the programme, applications can be submitted by the following types of organisations: voluntary and community organisations, including sports clubs; in certain circumstances, schools, colleges and local authorities; and national governing bodies of sport and third level education institutions, where it is evident that the proposed facility will contribute to the regional or national sporting infrastructure.All applications are treated on their merits and highest priority is afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation. Applications from schools and colleges must be made jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must provide for significant levels of usage by the local community during periods when the facilities are not being used by the school itself – at least 30 hours per week throughout the year – and demonstrate that the facilities concerned will meet an identified deficiency in that locality, as formally agreed with other local groups or the local authority.While responsibility for the provision of facilities at first and second level schools rests with the Department of Education and Science, some preliminary discussions have taken place between officials of that Department and mine on the potential which exists for greater co-operation between the Departments in the administration of programmes aimed at meeting the sporting and recreational needs of communities. Arrangements have been made between the two Departments for a meeting to be held to discuss these matters. In the context of the Government commitment to putting in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of local sports facilities throughout the country, the matter raised by the Deputy will also feature.As part of that plan, an inter-agency steering group will be set up by the middle of this year to devise this long-term strategy. It is proposed that in addition to a number of other Departments, the Department of Education and Science be represented on this steering group. One of the issues to be considered by this group will be maximising the use of existing sports facilities by local communities and in particular those located in schools.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	819	I propose to take Questions Nos. 401 and 481 together.The brief for phase 2 of the Orthopaedic Hospital in Clontarf has been written and approved by my Department. The proposed development includes the replacement of 32 orthopaedic rehabilitation beds and relocation of paramedical services, the out-patient department and associated clinical and non-clinical services. Also included is the development of a 64-bed secondary rehabilitation unit for older persons. The development will increase the total bed complement of the hospital to 160 beds in line with the Government's strategy to increase bed capacity generally throughout the health system. The design team has been selected using the appropriate EU procurement guidelines.At present, approval to progress this project is currently being considered by my Department in the context of a review of health capital projects under the national development plan. It is expected that this review will be completed shortly. My Department will then be in a position to discuss with the Eastern Regional Health Authority the question of progressing this project in the light of capital priorities overall within the authority's area and in line with funding resources available under the NDP.

#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	823	Funding for persons with an intellectual disability or autism is not provided on a capitation basis. Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards in respect of the provision of health related support services for persons with autism, intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities. In particular, €14.6 million has been invested in health-related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support to children of school-going age. In addition to this ring-fenced funding, children with disabilities have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities.Given the fact that children with disabilities can receive support from both specialist support services and through the community services, the information requested by the Deputy in relation to overall expenditure is not readily available in my Department. From information provided to my Department by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in November 2002, there were 1,525 children with autism under the age of 18 known to their services. The 2001 data from the national intellectual disability database indicated that there were 9,222 children with an intellectual disability aged 19 or under on the database. However, as some children with autism also have an intellectual disability and are therefore on the database, it is probable that there is some overlap between the sets of information. Initial work was carried out in 2002 on the development of an information system which would give a level of information on the needs of persons with autism, similar to that already available from the national intellectual disability database. This work is being continued during 2003.The national physical and sensory disability database is currently being rolled out nationally, following its launch in March 2002. To date, data collected on 16,343 individuals has been registered on the database. This figure represents just over 38.5% of the projected figure of 41,250 individuals for the database in accordance with those registered during phase 1 of the roll out. However, it is noteworthy that some health boards have indicated that the final figures registered on the database may be lower than originally estimated. As the Deputy can see from the measures outlined above, the Government is continuing to work to expand the level of support available nationally to children with disabilities.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	825	As the Deputy is aware, statutory responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons rests with the health boards in the first instance. Entitlement to orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. When a health board orthodontist decides that a child is in clinical need of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the criteria, he or she is then placed on a treatment waiting list.The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. In fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently severely restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. Consequently, a category C waiting list may not be maintained in some health boards.I have taken a number of measures to address this shortage. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications in training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus there is an aggregate of 20 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	827	The provision of school medical services, as an integral component of child health services, is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. The 1999 report, Best Health for Children, commissioned by the chief executive officers of the health boards, comprises a review of child health services, including the school health service. The aims of the core programme for child health surveillance set out in the report are to ensure that all children have the opportunity to realise their full potential in terms of good health, well being and development; and to identify remedial disorders at the earliest possible date and to treat them in a timely fashion.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	829	Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately €400 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This includes the sum of €29 million which was provided this year to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology and haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services. Cancer services throughout the country have benefited from this investment, which far exceeds the £25 million requirement initially envisaged under the strategy. This investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts, together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology.The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred. For example, the number of new patients receiving radiotherapy treatment has increased from 2,402 in 1994 to 3,809 in 2000. This means that an additional 1,407 patients are accessing these services, representing an increase of 58% nationally. The number of new patients receiving chemotherapy treatment has increased from 2,693 in 1994 to 3,519 in 2000, representing an increase of 30% nationally. Similarly, breast cancer surgery has increased from 1,333 in 1997 to 1,854 in 2001. This is an increase of 39% nationally.In recognition of the need to develop cancer services further, the national health strategy identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003 is being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department. This strategy will build on the progress that has been made during the implementation of the first national cancer strategy and set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years. The strategy will have regard to developments and best practice in other jurisdictions and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	834	Under the Health Act 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. For those who do not qualify for a medical card, there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his or her dependants do not have to pay more than €70 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances. Health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.As the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. The strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF, which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.

Charges can be made under two sets of regulations in respect of long-stay care. They can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. The regulations provide that a charge is made at a rate not exceeding the person's income. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.

I am attaching a table showing the location of these posts within the health board areas. Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct review of neurological services and related issues. Comhairle established a committee to, inter alia, examine existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and to make recommendations to Comhairle on the future organisation and development of those services. I understand from Comhairle that the committee's report will be available very shortly.The need for additional investment in neurology and neurophysiology will be considered in the light of the Comhairle report, other competing priorities, and the availability of adequate funding.

Each chief executive officer, in managing the workforce in his or her region, is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling. My Department, together with the health boards, is currently supporting the implementation of a key recommendation of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services relating to human resource planning, through the provision of a substantial number of additional postgraduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase since the end of 1999, from 26 to 83, in the number of student clinical psychologists employed in the health services.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	842	Following the publication of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services in March 2002, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.Given the key role of the Health Boards Executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The current position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of service imperatives, funding priorities and the Budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.

My Department will arrange to forward this analysis to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available. However, costs of administration across boards-authority is typically between 4% to 5% of the overall payroll costs. The range of staffing grades covered by this heading is significant and as one would expect includes staff who directly contribute, as frontline administrative staff, to the provision of patient services across a wide range of disciplines from consultants' secretaries to ward clerks to community services clerks etc. The heading "Management Admin Other" includes staff who work on accounts, payroll, personnel etc.Again the amount and percentage of money spent on other grades mentioned by the Deputy nurses, doctors amount to approximately 36% and 16%, respectively, of payroll costs. It is not possible to determine the spending on hospital beds or patients in isolation of the pay cost of staffing, given the fact that 70% approximately of health overall spending is on pay, with 30% on non-pay issues.The table gives an overall picture of the spending on pay across grades from 2002 details. The category direct patient care covers staff employed as attendants, nurses aides, house parents etc.

The review group finalised draft circulars, which were issued by the Department of Health and Children to all health boards in July 2002, to standardise the procedures used at health board level for the operation of the various allowances and grants. The circular confirms the purpose of mobility allowance as an allowance that "provides financial support to eligible people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey."The circular on motorised transport grant states:a health board may pay a grant towards the purchase of a car and/or adaptations to a car being purchased by a person with a severe disability who is 17 years or older and up to 65 years of age, where such a car is essential for him/her to obtain or retain employment. Self-employed persons who satisfy the criteria of eligibility may also be considered (subject to above age limits).Therefore, the two schemes are mutually exclusive.Furthermore, the 1968 Circular on Motorised Transport Grant stated that "the making of grants should be on the condition that the health authority will not be called upon at any future date to contribute towards the running expenses". The revised motorised grant circulars reiterate this position by confirming that:The payment of a motorised transport grant is subject to the condition that the health board will not be called upon at any future date to contribute towards the running costs of the vehicle. In this context, a mobility allowance recipient cannot qualify for the motorised transport grant. Similarly, a person who has received the motorised transport grant in the previous three years cannot qualify for mobility allowance. Where a mobility allowance recipient wishes to avail of a motorised transport grant, mobility allowance should cease from the date of payment of the motorised transport grant.

If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, I would be most anxious to know about it and to have it investigated by my officials.

Applicants must be 16 years or older and under 66 years. The allowance provides financial support to eligible persons who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.Eligible persons must reside at home or in any long-stay facility. Such eligible persons can continue to receive payment after they reach their 66th birthday. The current maximum rate of payment for the mobility allowance is €132 per month. The assessment of entitlement to and payment of the mobility allowance in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply directly to him.

Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the maintenance and development of such services are decided by the health boards in consultation with boards' regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector providers and consumers are also represented on the co-ordinating committees.The Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.

The review group finalised draft circulars which were issued by the Department of Health and Children to all health boards in July 2002 to standardise the procedures used at health board level for the operation of the various allowances and grants.Mobility allowance is a means tested monthly payment, payable by the health boards for persons with a severe disability who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. Eligible persons must reside at home or in any long-stay facility. Such eligible persons can continue to receive payment after they reach their 66th birthday. The current maximum rate of payment for the mobility allowance is €132 per month.The review group recommended that for mobility allowance "entitlement should be extended to applicants 66 years and over who would otherwise qualify". There are no funds available this year to meet the costs of implementing this matter. It is my intention to examine this matter in the context of the Estimates for 2004.

Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for people with disabilities. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.In relation to the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, I wish to advise the Deputy that the majority of recommendations made in this report have either been implemented in full or are in the process of being implemented.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	867	Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970 determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders. Those who are dependants of non-medical card holders are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EU regulations or where they are in receipt of a disability allowance.Students who are financially independent of their parents are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants. The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.

This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.

This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes including services for older people.The number of clients who received meals on wheels in the NAHB in 2002 was 16,510. This is a valuable community support service which enables older persons to live in dignity in their own homes. During 2002, the NAHB examined various protocols to ensure a more efficient use of resources, as well as the upgrading of premises and equipment, and of training of staff in food safety standards. Unfortunately, the withdrawal of community employment workers who were employed in this service has led to reduced services in some areas.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	877	Automatic eligibility to a medical card was statutorily introduced for all persons aged 70 years and over, regardless of means, who sought the medical card for the first time in the community from 1 July 2001. This was announced on budget day in December 2000.In order to access the GMS scheme, all persons must apply to their local health board for inclusion by completing and returning the requisite documentation. Services for medical card holders are provided by a range of suitably qualified health professionals, in a variety of settings, who hold contracts with the local health boards for the provision of these services.It is not possible to choose to be a patient of a non-GMS contract holding general practitioner and qualify for the other attendant benefits of a medical card holder. Prescriptions, for instance, are issued by GMS doctors on prescription pads which bear the particular doctor's registration number.During the course of industrial relations negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, at the HSEA, prior to the 1 July 2001 start date, it was agreed by both parties that general practitioners who had not previously been GMS contract holders could apply for limited entry to the scheme thereby allowing them to continue to treat their patients in this age category. However, in order to qualify for a GMS contract the applicant doctor must satisfy various criteria including vocational training, as is required by an EU directive. It should also be remembered that general practitioners cannot be compelled to apply to be included in the GMS scheme if they do not wish to do so.Since the circular issued by my Department in August 2001 reflects the agreed outcome of both parties, I do not have any plans to amend any section of it at present.
Question No. 466 withdrawn.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	879	I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that approximately half of all smears originating within the South Eastern Health Board region are sent to the eastern region for processing. Within the Eastern Regional Health Authority, smears are processed in date order, regardless of where they originate from, except in the case of smears marked as clinically urgent, which are processed quickly.There is currently a backlog for cervical screening within the eastern region. With regard to routine screening, the turnaround time varies from between six and 15 weeks. However, I should emphasise that if a smear is notified as clinically urgent, it is usually processed within one week, regardless of its origin.Hospitals and agencies within the ERHA process both conventional pap smears and liquid based smears. Consumables for liquid based smears are more expensive, but from a screening viewpoint, they are considered faster to screen. In 2003, additional funding was allocated to St. Luke's and other agencies in Dublin for the extra cost of consumables for liquid based smears originating within the eastern region. In due course, if proved to be cost efficient, this new method of screening may be extended. The ERHA has advised that although the consumables for liquid based cytology are more expensive, it is envisaged that the additional expense will be offset by a faster screening time per smear, resulting in a consequent reduction in the turn around times.

The majority of these businesses are retail and catering establishments, in addition to plants manufacturing foods of non-animal origin.In the course of their duties environmental health officers use the enforcement powers available under the Food Hygiene Regulations 1950 – 1989, the European Communities (Official Control of Foodstuffs) Regulations 1998 and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998. The number of enforcement actions has increased since 1999, reflecting greater use of the enforcement provisions of the FSAI Act. The additional powers available under this Act include improvement, prohibition, closure orders as well as improvement notices. These strengthened legal powers enable more effective and speedier action by enforcement officers than previously possible.I am satisfied that the arrangements currently in place are adequate to ensure that food consumed, distributed, marketed or produced in Ireland meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene.

Funding is being provided to enable a number of additional staff to be appointed in order to establish a primary care team, which will include general practitioners, nurses-midwives, health care assistants, home helps, an occupational therapist, physiotherapist, a social worker and administrative personnel.In 2002 the following funding was provided: revenue –€100,000; information and communications technology –€100,000; and minor capital –€135,000.The Western Health Board has indicated that, since approval was given for this project, work has been under way to develop it. This has included consultation with the existing primary care providers in the area and a team development and training programme. The board has also indicated that structures have been put in place to manage the development of the project, involving local staff representation, community service county level and at regional level.Additional revenue funding of €410,000 has been allocated for the continued development of the implementation project in 2003. My Department has indicated to the health board that this funding will be released on receipt of confirmation that the additional staff necessary to make up the primary care team have been appointed and that satisfactory progress has been made with the establishment of the project.

It is understood that the total cost of the project was approximately €430,000 and that the Midland Health Board met the balance of the cost from its overall revenue allocation. The project involved the installation of a broadband network between the three main Midland Health Board sites, Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise, as well as upgrading PBX equipment at these sites. The project provides a solid foundation for advanced ICT applications and facilitates improved access by telephone for clients of the board.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	918	Responsibility for the provision of health services in Tallaght is a matter for the South Western Area Health Board, SWAHB, operating under the aegis of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has been informed by the ERHA that the projected demographic profile for the area shows an increasing population of older people. This undoubtedly will give rise to increased demands for continuing care beds in the area. It is not possible, however, at this stage to advise of specific needs in the Tallaght area.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department recently announced the development of nine new community nursing units through the public private partnership initiative for the ERHA area. Three of these units are to be located in the SWAHB area. The proposed locations are Cherry Orchard Hospital, Brú Chaoimhín and either St. Loman's Hospital or St Brigid's Home, Crooksling. It is proposed that 50 beds will be provided in each of these units. Business advisers for these projects have been appointed and the next phase is the preparation of a business case for submission to my Department and the Department of Finance.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	921	The use of aluminium compounds, in particular, aluminium zirconium chloride hydroxide complexes, is subject to control under regulations in force in this country by virtue of the EU directives relating to cosmetic products. The controls in these directives are made, and are frequently updated, by the European Commission following consultation with the EU Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products, SCCNFP.I have not been made aware of any recent concerns in relation to health side effects in relation to these products. If such concerns were to arise, it would be appropriate that they be referred to the European Commission for examination in consultation with the scientific committee concerned.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	923	There is an established framework in place for a co-ordinated response to major emergencies. The purpose of the framework is to establish common procedures in each of the front-line emergency services for activating emergency plans and co-ordination, control and co-operation during peacetime emergencies.The Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and each of the health boards has an emergency plan which is based on this framework and which is kept under constant review. The main aim of the plans is to ensure that the health service is in a position to mobilise all necessary and available resources and to utilise these to best advantage in order that the resulting response will be appropriate, structured, co-ordinated and effectively managed. The emergency plan can be activated by the ambulance service, fire service or the Garda.Each acute general hospital, including those providing accident and emergency services, has an emergency plan which is an essential subset of ERHA-health boards' major emergency plans. Hospital emergency plans are designed to deal with the receipt and treatment of patients in the event of the occurrence of a major incident. The aim is to ensure that hospitals are in a position to provide appropriate treatment for incoming casualties.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	924	As the Deputy may be aware, private nursing homes are private ventures and vulnerable to market forces. My Department does not routinely collate information on the number of beds available in private nursing homes but does monitor the situation on an ongoing basis.Public private partnerships, PPPs, are being piloted in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Southern Health Board areas. It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will be developed under the PPP initiative and that a maximum of 850 new long-stay beds for older people will be provided, 450 of these in the ERHA area and 400 in the Southern Health Board area. The services offered in these units will include assessment-rehabilitation, respite, extended care and convalescence.Day care centres for older people will form an integral part of each CNU site to help promote the dignity and independence of older people and to support them with living at home. Business advisers have been appointed to the projects and are engaged in preparing an outline business case. It is not possible to be precise at this stage about the cost per bed of the proposed new developments. However, given the range of services and facilities to be provided in the CNUs, both the capital cost and running costs are not comparable to those of private sector nursing homes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	925	Responsibility for the funding of services at the hospitals referred to by the Deputy rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. Therefore, my Department has asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the position in relation to the number of elderly persons in acute hospitals who could be moved to a more appropriate setting and to reply directly to the Deputy.The national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, is one of the key actions for dealing with public hospital waiting lists arising from the health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You. Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public hospital patients waiting longest on in-patient lists in order that they can be offered treatment under this initiative where capacity is not readily available in the public sector. Capacity is sourced by the NTPF, mainly from private hospitals in Ireland, with some additional capacity also having been identified in the United Kingdom. Approximately 4,000 patients have been treated by the NTPF to date. I am satisfied that the NTPF is making an important contribution to the reduction of hospital waiting lists and I have no plans to redirect its funding to other services.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	926	The system of capital allowances for nursing homes registered with health boards was introduced in the budget of 1998 by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and my Department does not have information on the number of nursing home proprietors who took advantage of these allowances.My Department has no control over the location of new private nursing home developments as such projects are developed by the private sector. However, my Department would, as a matter of course, advise potential private nursing home proprietors, where such advice is sought, to contact the relevant health board for the area in which the proposed nursing home is to be located for advice on the statutory requirements for registration under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. Private nursing homes, as commercial enterprises, are subject to local market forces in relation to bed occupancy rates.The placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged to that person are a private arrangement entered into between the nursing home and the individual. However, health boards are entitled under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 to contract beds in private nursing homes.Standards of care in private nursing homes are governed by the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993. My Department is reviewing the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 to determine their relevancy and efficacy in providing long-term care to the elderly. The objective of the review is to develop a scheme which will be transparent, offer a high standard of care for clients, provide equity within the system to include standardised dependency and means-testing, be less discretionary, be consistent in implementation throughout the country and draw on experience of the operation of the old scheme.

In its report presented in March 2001, the group recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with this condition.The working group found that the internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multidisciplinary team. In 2002, additional revenue funding of €6.061 million was allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further €1.64 million was allocated in 2003 for the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services.The additional funding provided for health boards in 2002 and 2003 is as follows:

#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	935	Responsibility for the provision of health services in north Dublin rests with the Northern Area Health Board, NAHB, operating under the aegis of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for older people.The number of clients who received meals on wheels in the NAHB in 2002 was 16,510. This is a valuable community support service which enables older persons to live in dignity in their own homes. During 2002, the NAHB examined various protocols to ensure a more efficient use of resources, as well as the upgrading of premises and equipment and training of staff in food safety standards. Unfortunately, the withdrawal of community employment workers employed in this service has led to reduced services in some areas.The authority has advised my Department that the meals on wheels service for 2003 is under review and that some adjustments will have to be made in some areas. The authority has further advised that it will ensure that the meals on wheels service provided for older people in 2003 will be prioritised on the basis of those most in need.

The role and functions of the NHA were considered by Prospectus Management consultants as part of the audit of structures and functions of the health care system. The establishment of the national hospitals agency will therefore be considered in the context of the recommendations of the Prospectus report.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	938	Funding for the expansion of out of hours co-operatives, totalling €4.143 million, was allocated to six health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in April of this year. The reason these allocations were announced in April as opposed to being notified earlier in health board's letters of determination was solely to allow for detailed discussions with and submissions from the health board personnel involved in the proposed co-operative expansions.

The detailed work programme of the commission is a matter for the commission to determine in accordance with its statutory functions under the Mental Health Act. However, I understand that one of the priorities for the commission over the next year will be to put in place the structures required for the operation of mental health tribunals. The tribunals, operating under the aegis of the Mental Health Commission, will conduct a review of each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient on an involuntary basis or to extend the duration of such detention.The Mental Health Commission will also appoint an inspector of mental health services, which will replace the existing office of the inspector of mental health hospitals. The inspector will be required to visit and inspect all approved centres at least once a year. The Minister will be empowered to make regulations specifying the standards to be maintained in all approved centres and these will be enforced by the inspector. The inspector's annual report and review of the mental health services will be published along with the commission's report.The commission has recently advertised the position of inspector of mental health services and three other senior administrative posts. The commission has a budget of €2.24 million for 2003.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	940	Arising from the health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, is initially concentrating on those adults waiting longer than 12 months for treatment and children waiting longer than six months.Health boards have been asked to identify patients waiting longest on public hospital waiting lists in order that they can be offered treatment under this initiative. The NTPF negotiates prices with hospitals having regard to the volume and complexity of the work to be undertaken. My Department has been informed by the chief executive of the NTPF that the prices negotiated by the fund compare favourably with the prices charged to the private health insurers.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	941	In October 2002 I gave approval to the establishment of an initial ten primary care implementation projects, one in each health board area. The projects will involve putting in place in ten locations throughout the country a primary care team in line with the model described in the primary care strategy. As the ten projects are developed, more than 80,000 clients will benefit from having direct access to an improved range of services provided by their primary care team.There has been no reduction in the level of funding allocated to these implementation projects. Funding totalling €8.4 million has been provided for this purpose in 2002 and 2003. Revenue funding of €877,000 was provided for 2002, and this allocation was increased to €4.5 million for 2003. Once-off capital funding of €2 million and a further €1 million in respect of information and communications technology supports for the teams were also provided in 2002.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	946	In Ireland the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, plays a key role in the prevention and management of infectious diseases. The infectious diseases notifiable by the health boards to the National Disease Surveillance Centre are as follows: acute anterior poliomyelitis, acute encephalitis, acute viral meningitis, anthrax, bacillary dysentery, bacterial meningitis (including meningococcal septicaemia), brucellosis, cholera, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, nvCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease, diphtheria, food poisoning (bacterial other than salmonella), gastroenteritis (when contracted by children under two years), infectious mononucleosis, infectious parotitis (mumps), influenzal pneumonia, legionnaires disease, leptospirosis, malaria, measles, ornithosis, plague, rabies, rubella, salmonellosis (other than typhoid or paratyphoid), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), smallpox, tetanus, tuberculosis, typhoid and paratyphoid, typhus, viral haemorrhagic diseases, viral hepatitis type A, viral hepatitis type B, viral hepatitis unspecified, whooping cough, yellow fever; sexually transmitted infections – ano-gential warts, candidiasis, chancroid, chlamydia trachomatis, genital herpes simplex, gonorrhoea, granuloma inguinale, infectious hepatitis B, lymphogranuloma venereum, molluscum contagiosum, non-specific urethritis, pediculosis pubis, syphilis and trichomoniasis.My officials have been in discussion with the National Disease Surveillance Centre regarding the amending of this list to exclude those diseases no longer relevant and to include additional infectious diseases to the list.I recently amended the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 1981 to designate SARS as a notifiable infectious disease.The Irish approach to infectious diseases outbreaks and epidemics is based on sound internationally accepted principles such as: preventative measures, early identification of cases, effective clinical care including good hospital infection control, appropriate surveillance and contract tracing and management of contacts. The procedures for dealing with infectious diseases are based on these principles.Many infectious diseases can be prevented by vaccine use. Immunisation against infectious disease has probably saved more lives than any other public health intervention, apart from the provision of clean water. Improvements in living standards have reduced the mortality from infectious diseases, but immunisation has also played a large role in the reduction of disease incidence. It would not have been possible to eradicate smallpox without vaccine, and the eradication of polio in the European region is also largely due to immunisation.In recent years, improved economic and social conditions together with public health action have virtually eliminated the pandemics of communicable diseases.In the event of disease outbreak I have in the past and will continue to establish expert committees/groups to advise on the most appropriate action given the particular circumstances of the outbreak concerned. Guidelines and protocols based on the principles referred to above are developed which are appropriate to the situation concerned. The guidelines are based on the advice of the committee concerned and also take into account guidance published by the World Health Organisation, WHO, the Centre for Disease Control, CDC, in the USA and a number of other reputable international public health institutions.Regarding isolation, in recent years it has become the practice to refer and treat patients with infectious disease in acute general hospitals. It is now generally agreed by the medical profession, including the Medical Council, that an acute general hospital is the appropriate setting for the delivery of this service.

No. 12 of 1999) and in the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975 (section 3) (Offences) Regulations 1997 (S.I. No. 395 of 1997).This on-the-spot fines system already applies in respect of breaches of safety belt/appropriate child restraint requirements and in respect of a wide range of other offences under the road traffic code.I do not propose to extend the present on-the-spot fines system to further road traffic offences due to the fact that the Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the replacement of the current on-the spot fines system by a fixed charge system. The new system has been applied in respect of speeding offences since October 2002. I propose to apply that system in respect of safety belt/appropriate child restraint offences, which are the responsibility of a driver, from 1 July 2003 to facilitate the application of the penalty points system to those offences.

This includes the purchase of a further 40 DART cars which are being manufactured. This will have increased capacity on DART services, both north and south of Dublin, by almost 100% since 2000.The company is accepting delivery of a fleet of 80 new diesel railcars; 76 of which are due for services on outer suburban routes serving Dublin later this year. Iarnród Éireann informs me that it intends to lengthen all rush hour diesel railcars operating on the northern suburban line to eight cars upon entry into service of these units. This will have the effect of increasing capacity by 43% on the route from Dundalk and Drogheda. Services on the Maynooth to Dublin line will also benefit from the introduction of these new railcars with a 24% increase in capacity.The development of new bus services is a matter under consideration in the context of my statement to the public transport partnership forum on 7 November 2002 on public transport reform and especially the reform of the bus market in the greater Dublin area.

The regulations provide that the latest date a re-test can be carried out is 28 days following the date of the initial test and that the application for a re-test must be made to the National Car Testing Service, NCTS, not later than 21 days following the initial test.The vehicle concerned was refused a test certificate when it failed the initial NCT test conducted on 11 February 2003. An application for a re-test of the vehicle was made on 24 February 2003 and a re-test appointment was confirmed for 7 March 2003. However, the vehicle did not pass the re-test. It is understood from NCTS that on 11 March 2003 the owner of the vehicle contacted NCTS to make a further test appointment. However, as the 21-day period for making a re-test appointment had expired on 4 March 2003, an appointment at that stage could only be for a full NCT test for which the standard test fee would be payable.In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the fees levied by NCTS in respect of the full tests and re-tests carried out on the vehicle concerned are in order.

I recently met a delegation on the issue and made the point to them that local involvement was vital for the re-opening of such stations.I understand that local developers are prepared to assist Iarnród Éireann financially, if necessary. However, the company informs me that Dunleer has a small population of approximately 1,000 and that the planned housing schemes are small, low-density developments. The demand generated is unlikely to justify the substantial costs of €4 million plus of re-opening the station. Iarnród Éireann has assured me, however, that it will keep the situation under review.

Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the gardaí to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.Preliminary indications from the Garda Síochána in respect of the operation of the system to date are that, with no reduction in enforcement efforts, there has been a significant drop in the number of detections for speeding offences. There was also a significant reduction in road deaths over that period. In the first six months of the operation of the system the number of road deaths was 143, compared with 211 road deaths in the period from November 2001 to April 2002.The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the Courts Service. In addition, the compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for that force.

The results of those surveys indicate that 51% of cars exceed the general speed limit of 60 miles per hour on two lane national primary routes, with 13% in excess of 70 miles per hour.The NRA has subsequently carried out a sample "free speed" survey based on a sub-set of the original sites from the 1999 survey, and has also carried out a comprehensive speed survey, the results of which will be available shortly. Preliminary indications from this survey show that improvements have been made in speeding on rural roads.Over the past five years, two seat-belt surveys have been carried out by the National Roads Authority, in 1999 and 2002, and a third survey is being undertaken this summer. The survey carried out in 1999 showed that the driver seat-belt wearing rate increased marginally from 51% to 55% over the eight year period 1991 to 1999. The survey also showed that male driver wearing rates declined slightly from 49% to 48% and female driver wearing rates increased from 61% in 1991 to 68% in 1999. The wearing rates for rear seat passengers in 1999 was 20%.The NRA carried out a further comprehensive seat-belt survey last year and, while the report is not yet published, preliminary indications show that substantial progress has been made on seat-belt wearing. The results of this survey will be available shortly.

It is Government policy that the relevant Irish transport authorities should support the application of developments in the field of ITS to road safety, drawing on international work in this field.Practical examples of the application of ITS in Ireland include the real-time parking information signs in Dublin and the variable information signs on the approaches to Kildare. The introduction of variable signage on the M50 for traffic management and road safety purposes is also well advanced.ITS is an unfolding concept and further progress in exploiting it, particularly for road safety purposes, will depend on the pace and scope of developments in the field. Accordingly, my Department has recently joined ERTICO, which is a European body concerned with the promotion of telematics on road and public transport in Europe which will help inform future developments in Ireland. My Department is also considering the role of telematics as part of a future transport research programme. The output from a conference in Dublin last November organised by Dublin City Council in association with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the National Roads Authority, Trinity College Dublin and my Department on ITS has been useful in this regard.I understand that the OECD is preparing to publish the report of a working group on using technology to improve road safety. This is expected to address the benefits and challenges of deploying new technology for road safety purposes and to make recommendations so that governments can be begin the process of exploiting ITS for such purposes. I will be looking carefully at the recommendations in that light.

The results of those surveys indicate that 51% of cars exceed the general speed limit of 60 miles per hour on two lane national primary routes, with 13% in excess of 70 miles per hour.The NRA has subsequently carried out a sample "free speed" survey based on a sub-set of the original sites from the 1999 survey, and has also carried out a comprehensive speed survey, the results of which will be available shortly. Preliminary indications from this survey show that improvements have been made on speeding on rural roads.Over the past five years, two seat-belt surveys have been carried out by the National Roads Authority, in 1999 and 2002, and a third survey is being undertaken this summer. The survey carried out in 1999 showed that driver seat-belt wearing rate increased marginally from 51% to 55% over the eight year period 1991 to 1999. The survey also showed that male driver wearing rates declined slightly from 49% to 48% and female driver wearing rates increased from 61% in 1991 to 68% in 1999. The wearing rates for rear seat passengers in 1999 was 20%.The NRA carried out a further comprehensive seat-belt survey last year and, while the report is not yet published, preliminary indications show that substantial progress has been made on seat-belt wearing. The results of this survey will be available shortly.

This is in addition to the current grounds where the Garda has formed an opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol.The steps being taken in the Act represent a move towards random breath testing, by extending the grounds on which a member of the Garda can request a preliminary breath specimen, but maintain an efficient use of resources. This is an effective and targeted manner in which we can use the resources available to us and equates to standard practice in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The commencement of section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 is being considered in consultation with the Garda, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and the Attorney General's office.Policy on drink-driving was set out in the Government's road safety strategy 1998 to 2002 which stated clearly that a move towards unqualified random breath testing is not envisaged within the period of the strategy given its possible negative implications for wider public attitudes to and co-operation with the Garda. That strategy also provided for the continued application of the current blood alcohol level of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, and the priority was to improve compliance with this requirement rather than to move to new limits.That strategy has now completed its term and the Government is committed to the development of a new road safety strategy that will apply for the next three years. The new strategy, which is being prepared by the high level group on road safety, will give consideration to the best approach to future policy on drink-driving.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	981	The Government strategy on road safety 1998 to 2002 recognised that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of the presence of drugs is however more complex than for alcohol. Consequently, considerably more work is needed to develop a more detailed regulatory regime in relation to drugs and driving. A number of research programmes are being carried out internationally in this area and the strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments.The Medical Bureau of Road Safety has participated in an international survey relating to the position with drug driving in 24 European countries. The results indicate that in almost all countries blood and urine samples are collected at the police station or hospital for the purposes of drug testing.The MBRS is aware that both urine and saliva screening devices have been developed for roadside drug testing. Urine is not, however, considered to be suitable for roadside drug testing. Saliva testing devices are in prototype stages. The MBRS is keeping abreast of developments internationally in this area.Research on drugs and driving in Ireland has been carried out by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, through the analysis of blood and urine specimens for the presence of drugs. This analysis by the MBRS sought to identify trends in the types of drugs being taken, their combination with alcohol and the extent of polydrug use. Further statistical analysis of the data is being undertaken by the MBRS, and its report will be issued in 2003.While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, the research programme when completed will, along with other international analysis and research in this area, inform development of better testing methods for the presence of drugs, changes in enforcement practice and procedures and possibly changes to existing legislation.

The purpose of the directive is to ensure that national standards for spray suppression equipment do not constitute barriers to trade. The directive ensures this by setting type approval standards and requiring that the sale of new vehicles fitted with the specified equipment may not be prohibited in any member state.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	988	The Government's strategy for road safety 1998 to 2002 referred to international interest in and experience of daytime running lights, DRL, as an instrument of road safety that warranted serious consideration in Ireland. International research literature on DRL, however, indicates differing perceptions of its effectiveness as a road safety tool. Certain vulnerable road users also have concerns about a perceived detrimental effect on them arising from the use of DRL by motor vehicles. It also raises some energy consumption and climate change issues.Having regard to the contradicting views on the effectiveness of DRL on road safety, the European Commission decided to undertake its own comprehensive study in the matter and has tendered for a services contract for a project to assess the crash reducing effectiveness of daytime running lights together with their effect on crashes into pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and other vulnerable road users.One pilot project on the use of DRL was carried out by Dublin City Council in 2002. Results from an evaluation of the project are not yet to hand. Lessons from the pilot project, as well as the views of various groups that have concerns about a general application of DRL together with the outcome of the study at EU level and the Commission's response to it, will inform decisions regarding the future promotion of DRL.

The programme is aimed at prioritising national development plan funding to various disadvantaged neighbourhoods in large urban areas. Under the scheme, Bus Éireann introduced a new route in Cork city, the southern orbital bus service, on a pilot basis. The Department provided funding of €288,000 towards the project and is evaluating the project with a view to providing further funding in 2003.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	992	The proposals mentioned by the Deputy are all contained in Dublin Transportation Office's strategy, A Platform for Change 2000-16.Last year the Government agreed that the development of the Dublin metro should be undertaken on a phased basis and as a public private partnership, PPP. Phase one of the metro involves a line from Blanchardstown and Dublin Airport to the city centre and to Shanganagh. Since then, the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, has concentrated its work on developing the outline business case for phase one. The RPA has also conducted a preliminary public consultation and a pre-qualification exercise for potential bidders. More recently, Iarnród Éireann has submitted a preliminary proposal for a DART link from Connolly Station to the airport.In November 2002, my Department received the outline business case, OBC, for phase one from the RPA. The OBC includes cost-benefit analyses, a financing model, system options, a number of route alignment options, the estimated cost over the lifetime of the project and the estimated timescales involved.The final costs of the project will be determined by a number of factors, including the route alignment chosen, the structure of the PPP and the bids received as part of the competitive tendering process. The advisers engaged by the RPA have estimated that the cost of the various options for phase one of the project range from €1.7 billion to €3.8 billion in terms of total direct capital cost at 2002 prices. These figures increase substantially when one estimates a final cost which takes account of expected inflation over the period between now and when services commence, VAT, fees, interest charges, the cost of risk transfer and a provision for risk and contingency. However, a more accurate cost can only be determined when the final structure of the project is decided and competitive bids are received from the interested parties. Nevertheless, I have asked the RPA to review each element of the costs to identify scope for reductions and my Department and the RPA is having discussions in this regard.The possible effects which a project of this scale may have on the overall Exchequer finances and Ireland's obligations under the EU Stability and Growth Pact are also being examined and no conclusions have yet been reached in this regard.Following completion of the evaluation of the metro outline business case and the other work referred to above, and of the Iarnród Éireann proposal, I intend to bring my recommendations to the Government in the near future.

The detailed policy in relation to the positioning of traffic signs addressing siting, placement, mounting heights and orientation considerations is set out in the traffic signs manual, which was published in 1996. A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library.It is proposed to introduce metric units of measurement for road traffic speed limit signs and speed measurement in 2004 and to complete the ongoing conversion from imperial to metric values on road traffic distance signs at the earliest possible date. The change over to metric values in these fields of application will fulfil the requirements of the European Communities (Units of Measurement)(Amendment) Regulations 2002 (SI 619 of 2002) and of the European Communities (Units of Measurement) (Amendment) Regulations 2001 (SI 283 of 2001) in this regard.The adoption of metric values for speed limits will create the need for alternations to the current imperial values and I am taking the opportunity afforded by the process of metrication to review the current speed limit structure.

The proposals were also discussed on the basis of a presentation by the British Home Secretary at the Informal JHA Council held in Greece on 28-29 March 2003.In summary, the UK proposals, which do not have the intention referred to by the Deputy, involved in the medium term, the establishment of centres on transit routes to the EU for the processing of asylum applications particularly those lodged by persons who are economic migrants; in the longer term, measures to improve the regional management of migration flows through solutions, inter alia, which address the causes of mass population outflows; greater protection for displaced persons in or near countries of origin; and the development of managed resettlement routes or legal routes for genuine refugees to come to the EU and raising awareness of states' responsibilities to accept returns of failed asylum seekers.The European Council meeting in Brussels on 20 and 21 March 2003 noted the United Kingdom proposal and invited the European Commission to further explore the ideas contained therein, in particular with the UNHCR, and to report to the meeting of the next Council in June 2003. I understand that the Commission is examining the proposal at the present time in consultation with the UNHCR.I welcome the development of enhanced co-operation by EU states and initiatives aimed at addressing the large-scale abuse of asylum processes by persons who are primarily interested in entering the Union for economic reasons and at ensuring that genuine refugees receive protection more quickly. The UK proposals were framed with these objectives in mind. However, as the proposals in question are still very much preliminary ideas for new approaches to protection, I would consider it prudent to await the outcome of the European Commission's consideration of the complex issues involved and its report to the June European Council.

This Government and the previous Government have continued to advance its equality agenda to improve the position of people with disabilities across a range of areas. My Department has been responsible for ensuring that the necessary legislative and infrastructural framework is in place to support this agenda. Achievements by my Department in response to the recommendations of the commission's report include the following: establishment of a disability equality section in my Department to provide a central focus for disability equality policy and legislation development; enactment of the Employment Equality Act 1998 which prohibits discrimination on nine specified grounds including disability and provided for the establishment of equality infrastructure; establishment of the Equality Authority which has statutory responsibility to work towards elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equal opportunities; establishment of the Equality Tribunal which provides the main locus for redress of first instance for equality cases; enactment of the Disability Authority Act 1999; establishment of the National Disability Authority, NDA, in June 2000 to develop and monitor standards in services for people with disabilities and to advise on disability policy and practice; enactment of the Equal Status Act 2000 which prohibits discrimination on nine specified grounds including disability in relation to the provision of goods, services and facilities; introduction of the policy of mainstreaming of disability services so that the responsibility for and the provision of services to people with disabilities rests with the mainstream Department or agency concerned; establishment of and overseeing the work of the monitoring committee in relation to the 3% target level for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service outside the Civil Service; a programme of initiatives, since 1997, to create awareness of disability issues including annual national disability information days which are co-sponsored by the European Commission and disability awareness weeks in December 1997 and May 1999, in which nationwide tours were undertaken to heighten awareness of disability issues. The policy of mainstreaming, introduced in 2000, was a key principle of the commission's report. As a result of this policy, each Government Department and State agency is now responsible directly for the delivery of good standards in services for people with disabilities and for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations of the report that pertain to that Department. In conclusion, I wish to advise the Deputies that while my Department is charged with providing overall support and advice on equality and indeed has made great strides in this regard, each Government Department and agency has a key role to play in implementing the recommendations of the commission in a way that supports equality of opportunity and brings about a change in society within the principle of mainstreaming.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1013	I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the register of ownership created and maintained by the Land Registry is made up of approximately two million folios. The first folio was opened in 1892 and over the years a number of different formats have been used for folios in order to improve the clarity of the information therein. The vast majority of folios are structured into three parts: Part 1 describes the property; Part 2 identifies the owner(s); and Part 3 shows the burdens etc. affecting the property. I am further informed that prior to computerisation, all folios were created and held in paper format and previous or former owners and cancelled burdens were simply struck out manually when they no longer affected the property. However, these cancelled entries still remained visible, albeit no longer forming part of the register. Where such folios were subsequently revised, it has always been the practice of the Land Registry to show only current or extant entries on the face of the revised folio in order to provide the relevant information in as clear and concise a manner as possible. Formerly the majority of folio revisions arose as a result of vestings and consolidations by the Irish Land Commission. Currently most new folios are created when a parcel of land is divided; typically this arises for new houses. I am also informed that with the computerisation of folios in the Land Registry this practice of revising a folio has continued, i.e. on revision only current information is displayed as part of the folio. The historical information is, of course, still retained by the Land Registry as part of the background archive. Should this historical information be required for a particular purpose, the Land Registry is in a position to retrieve same, although it no longer forms part of the register.

Dealing Number D2002SM004682G refers. I am further informed that queries issued to the lodging solicitor on 18 November 2002 and that the application cannot proceed until the queries raised are satisfactorily resolved. I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. Accordingly it is not possible to estimate a completion date at this stage. However, I can assure the Deputy that on receipt of a satisfactory reply the matter will receive further attention in the Land Registry.

Section 2(1) of the Act provides that where an application for bail is made by a person charged with a serious offence, a court may refuse the application if it is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. For this purpose a serious offence is defined as one which carries a penalty of at least five years imprisonment on conviction and which is listed in the Schedule to the Bill (e.g. murder, manslaughter, sexual offences, drugs offences). The decision to grant or refuse bail in any particular case is a matter for the courts which are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The position regarding the adequacy of the bail provision is kept under continuing review.

I understand that the gardaí have not received any complaints from members of the public in relation to harassment in the park. Griffith Park is patrolled regularly by beat and foot patrols, both uniform and plain clothes, with the northern portion policed by the H district and the remainder by the U district. Special anti-social patrols target this park and other parks at weekends and will continue to do so.

Two cases of burglary were also recorded, both of which occurred just outside this particular area. I understand that a dedicated patrol van is being deployed in the East Wall-North Wall areas at specific times to counter these problems. In addition, foot patrols and detective units will continue to operate in the area, and it is the intention of the gardaí to increase the level of liaison with local residents and their community groups. Local Garda management have had a number of meetings with community groups in the area and further meetings are planned.

Dealing No. D2000SM008387Y refers. I am further informed that all outstanding queries have been resolved and that the application is receiving attention in the Land Registry. I can inform the Deputy that, subject to no further queries arising, the application will be completed within the next few weeks.

Tens of thousands of these e-mails are generated by criminal gangs every day in the hope that a small number of people will respond. This type of crime is a world-wide problem, and the GBFI liaises with law enforcement agencies around the world in attempting to prevent and detect such crime. The GBFI also liaises with Europol and Interpol in the international effort to target these criminal gangs. Fraud prevention advice is regularly and widely provided by the Garda to counteract these attempted fraudulent activities. One such gang was intercepted operating in Dublin in recent past and as a result of an operation by the GBFI, one UK national and two Nigerian nationals were subsequently sentenced to five years imprisonment following a trial at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court. The bureau is not aware of any such gangs operating in Ireland at present. However, should any such information come to hand, it will be fully investigated.

In addition, as the Deputy is aware, the development of a site for the construction of a system-built accommodation centre at Leggettsrath, Kilkenny, has also been halted pending the outcome of judicial review proceedings on planning matters relating to the site.In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on these properties where their proposed use is the subject of High Court litigation. I can say, however, more generally, that there is an ongoing requirement to provide accommodation under the system of direct provision for up to 900 newly arriving asylum seekers every month in addition to those already being accommodated under that system. Procuring accommodation for this purpose continues to be a very significant challenge in circumstances where the range of suitable options available and offered is extremely limited.

The opening hours of Ballinrobe Garda station are from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., Monday to Saturday inclusive and 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. on Sunday. I am also informed that local Garda management is satisfied that the current opening hours of Ballinrobe Garda station are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. Accordingly, there are currently no plans to alter these opening hours. The extension of the current opening hours at Ballinrobe Garda station to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties. Such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties.

However, I understand that the person in question has lodged an application for residency on the basis of his marriage to an Irish national in January 2003. The processing time for such applications is approximately nine months at the present time and consequently, it is likely that a decision on this application will be made in early 2004.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1029	Legislation to prohibit discrimination on nine specified grounds, including the ground of disability, is already in place under the Employment Equality Act 1998, in respect of employment and training, and the Equal Status Act 2000, in respect of education, the provision of goods, services and accommodation and disposal of property. Discrimination includes a refusal or failure by an employer or a service provider to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability by providing special treatment or facilities, if without such special treatment or facilities it would be impossible or unduly difficult for the person to avail himself or herself of the employment or service. A refusal or failure to provide the special treatment or facilities will not be deemed reasonable unless it would give rise to more than a nominal cost to the employer or service provider.The Equality Authority and the Equality Tribunal have been established as independent statutory bodies under the legislation. The Equality Authority is charged with promoting equality and working towards the elimination of discrimination. It provides information and advice to any person who feels that he or she has been discriminated against on any of the nine grounds, in either the employment or non-employment area. The Equality Tribunal investigates and decides on complaints of unlawful discrimination. In 2002, 50 cases involving the disability ground were referred, under the Equal Status Act, to the Equality Tribunal. In addition, 42 dismissal cases were referred to the Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court on the disability ground.The Government remains committed to bringing forward a disability Bill to underpin the principle of mainstreaming and provide for positive action measures to remove barriers to equal participation for people with disabilities. The formal consultation process on the proposed legislation, overseen by the expert consultation team appointed in April 2002, was completed in February of this year. In view of the complex and crosscutting issues which fall to be considered, the Government has referred the process of overseeing the preparation of the revised disability Bill to the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion. The Cabinet sub-committee will play a key role in facilitating cross-departmental co-operation in the development of both the legislative proposals and service planning over the coming months.

The standard rate of remission is one quarter of the whole sentence. In the context of the consolidation and modernisation of the prison rules generally, at present under way, the rules governing remission rates are being reviewed. However, it is not proposed to increase the standard rate of remission in the revised rules.

Application No. D2001SM004693Y refers. The Deputy will be aware that applications for duplicate land certificates take time to process due to the fact that notices have to issue to a number of institutions, an advertisement needs to be placed in The Law Society Gazette and certain time limits have to elapse before the application can receive further consideration. I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that a query in relation to this application was issued to the lodging solicitor on 22 April 2003. I am also informed that notices in relation to this application were sent to relevant institutions who may be able to assist the Land Registry with this application on 22 April 2003. I can assure the Deputy that once the notice period expires and on receipt of a satisfactory reply to the query raised, the application will receive further consideration.

Following an examination of the declaration and supporting documentation by officials in the citizenship section of my Department, a letter issued on 10 April last to the person concerned regarding aspects of the completion of the forms and seeking additional supporting documentation. A reply to this letter has not yet been received and, consequently, it is not possible to finalise the matter at this point in time. I will advise the Deputy when the matter has been concluded.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	I propose to take Questions Nos. 642 and 680 together.The report referred to by the Deputies was published on the Irish Prison Service website on 25 March 2003. Copies of the report had been forwarded to the Oireachtas Library on 17 October 2002. As I have previously said in my reply to Deputy Neville's Question No. 428 of 25 February 2003, there are strong reservations about interpreting the main finding of the study as suggesting that over 28% of the prisoner population in the country have a mental handicap. Any such suggestion is strongly disputed by people who work with prisoners in a professional capacity on a daily basis and there is a reasonable basis for argument that this unexpectedly high figure could be accounted for by measurement of factors attributable to educational deficit and social disadvantage, rather than learning disability per se.The authors of the report recommended that a number of priority steps be taken in relation to prisoners with learning disability. The director general of the Irish Prison Service has indicated that the particular recommendations relevant to the service are being considered in the context of the care and rehabilitation services for prisoners. These recommendations fall into three main categories: psychological assessment of prisoners who may have a learning disability; provision of training for personnel on needs and supports for people with learning disability and development of appropriate educational programmes and regimes in prisons designed to address the needs and learning characteristics of prisoners with learning disability. I am also informed by the director general that, at present, the routine medical, probation and education assessments at committal result in prisoners with learning disabilities coming to notice early in their time in custody. Such prisoners are provided with a range of supports appropriate to their circumstances, including, as required, referral for psychological assessment and special arrangements within education units and workshops.Such prisoners with learning disabilities may also be referred to the prison psychology service for assistance in coming to terms with and coping with their incarceration and in addressing their needs around dealing with their offending behaviour. As necessary, on a case by case basis, the psychology service, in conjunction with the Probation and Welfare Service, makes contact with community-based services in supporting the reintegration of offenders back into the community. This would include voluntary and statutory services working within the learning difficulties sector.

Her brother was granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of his marriage to an Irish national. In September 2001 she was granted permission to remain in the State for one year as an exceptional measure on the basis that she was dependent on her brother. She was 17 years of age at the time. She is now 20 years of age and is no longer a minor. The correspondence to which the Deputy refers cannot be traced in the immigration and citizenship division of my Department. However, there is information available on file which indicates that she no longer resides with her brother and, as a consequence, is no longer dependent on him. Consequently, the permission to remain which was originally granted to her cannot simply be extended on the basis of dependency. It will be necessary for her to apply for permission to remain in her own right setting out reasons why such permission should be granted. Although her family and domestic circumstances can be taken into account in the context of an application they will be evaluated by reference to the fact that the applicant is no longer a minor.

I might add that while the State has been bound by the convention for over 50 years now, its provisions cannot be pleaded directly before Irish courts. As a result of a commitment given by the Government in the Good Friday Agreement, the European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001 which is awaiting Report Stage in this House, contains the necessary provisions to give further effect to the convention in Irish law. The Bill will come into effect by ministerial order to be made within six months of the date of its enactment.

Both of these conventions contain provisions pertaining to access and apply to children under the age of 16. In response to earlier correspondence from the person referred to by the Deputy, the central authority sought further information in order to establish what assistance it might be able to offer in the particular circumstances of this case. The central authority is ready to offer what assistance it can once it has been given that information.

The Commission on Liquor Licensing has advocated a codification of the entire intoxicating liquor code and I intend to act on this recommendation. The necessary preparatory work is under way in my Department. This codification will involve a consolidation of licensing law, which is currently spread across many statutes, into a single instrument as well as reforms based on the commission's recommendations and the valuable work of the strategic task force on alcohol. My intention is that the outline of the codification Bill will be available by mid-2004.As regards the size of licensed premises, the Commission on Liquor Licensing has expressed concerns, which I share, regarding the recent proliferation of very large premises which create noise and nuisance for local residents and make compliance with and enforcement of the licensing laws much more difficult. The commission has recommended the creation of a new "small premises" licence for new entrants to the licensed trade as a means of countering this trend. This recommendation will also be considered as part of the codification exercise. Furthermore, while the commission did not propose imposing a statutory limit on the size of licensed premises, this is a matter which could also be explored in the context of drawing up legislation to give effect to the commission's recommendation. Following the submission in December last of the commission's report on admission and service in licensed premises, I announced that I would bring forward a package of legislative proposals to respond to the commission's urgent recommendations in relation to drunkenness and disorderly conduct on licensed premises. In the meantime, I have decided to enlarge this package to include legislative responses to certain recommendations set out in the commission's final report which was published last month. My intention is to bring the necessary proposals before Government in the coming weeks.

I am, indeed, informed that the community policing schemes which operate in Tallaght are also in operation in many other parts of the city and country. Community policing is a way of providing a policing service to the whole community both urban and rural, through the fostering of community commitment. In the provision of that service, An Garda Síochána aims to involve the community to the maximum achievable level in deciding on policing priorities and the appropriate level of service to be provided.The Garda authorities are aware and provide strong support for community policing through Garda community relations section, Harcourt Square and through local Garda management.

This represents an increase of 23 (or 17.3%) in the personnel allocated to Tallaght Garda station since 31 December 1997.The personnel strength of Tallaght Garda station together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, is monitored and reviewed by the Garda Síochána on an ongoing basis. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. I am further informed that the situation will be kept under review and when additional resources next become available, the needs of Tallaght Garda station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1046	I am informed by the Garda authorities that a report of criminal damage and burglary was made to the Garda following an incident at the school on 9 January 2003. The school management subsequently closed the school for one week to carry out repairs. I understand that local gardaí attended a meeting held on 30 January where similar incidents were outlined by speakers. The meeting was assured by the gardaí that a full Garda investigation would take place into the incident, and that local gardaí would patrol the school and its environs for the foreseeable future. A Garda was nominated to attend meetings of the action group which was established and has attended all meetings of the group since then. I also understand that the local crime prevention officer inspected the school and its environs and advised the school management on how to improve security at the site.Since January, the area has been patrolled by the Garda, including the mounted and dog units.

It provides that the name of the owner, and the address, of all premises to which an intoxicating liquor licence is attached shall be clearly indicated on a label affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises. The aim of this section is to complement existing provisions designed to combat the consumption of intoxicating liquor by persons under the age of 18 years.However, this provision has not been brought into force because it presents a range of practical and technical difficulties relating to the labelling of individual containers. Apart from the possible removal or alteration of labels after sale, difficulties also arise in connection with the labelling of individual bottles or cans which are already packed prior to distribution to licensed premises, including supermarkets and retail outlets.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1049	The current position is that section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 makes provision for the issue of age cards to persons who have attained the age of 18 years and who are therefore legally entitled to purchase and to consume alcohol in licensed premises. Detailed arrangements for the age card scheme are set out in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999.This is a voluntary age card scheme and it is operated by the Garda in order to assist licence holders to comply with legislative provisions relating to under-age drinking by providing evidence of age where a doubt exists. As an incentive towards greater use of the scheme, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides that in any proceedings against a licence holder for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person, it shall be a defence for the defendant to prove that an age card was looked for and was produced by the person in respect of whom the charge is brought. Serious penalties, including temporary closure of licensed premises, can result where a licence holder is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an under-age person.

The group was satisfied that, in order to fulfil this remit, it was not necessary to actively embark upon a broad consultation process. I received the report of the group at the end of March and I anticipate that the report will be brought before Government, for consideration and discussion, prior to any decision being taken on its publication.

Grants are available to a range of sessional and full day-care services provided by both community based/not-for-profit groups and private child care providers. The sessional services include a range of facilities including play groups. Statistics currently available do not differentiate between play groups and other types of child care service. However, it is possible to differentiate between grants made available to community groups and to private child care providers.To end April 2003, €150.7 million was allocated to more than 1,000 community based groups for the development of new or enhanced child care facilities or for the support of staffing costs in child care facilities which focus on services for disadvantaged families. The tables below detail, on a county by county basis, the numbers of approvals and rejected projects per county and the funding allocated to community based childcare facilities for staffing or capital purposes. The preparation of a detailed list of all community based projects which have received approval for capital or staffing funding will take some time and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme Approvals to Community Groups to end April 2003(i) Border, Midlands and Western Region

Support towards staffing costs is only made available to community based projects which can show that they are addressing disadvantage and are assisting disadvantaged parents who are in employment, education or training.On the basis of the information available to it in relation to this project, the programme appraisal committee did not recommend funding of this project, because it did not rate highly under the criteria in terms of tackling social disadvantage.The group has lodged an appeal against my decision in April 2003, and ADM Limited is currently assessing any new or additional information in support of its application.In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this appeal.

At that time there were over 11,000 applications on hand in respect of which no decision has been made. The case to which the Deputy refers is one of those cases. No further processing is taking place on these cases pending a determination by Government on the general policy to be adopted. I have given the Government a preliminary assessment of the implications of the judgment and, in the near future, I intend to bring to Government a more comprehensive assessment and proposals for action on foot of it.

The emphasis is on ensuring that people with disabilities are facilitated with access to employment opportunities and that every necessary accommodation is made in this regard. To help achieve this, my Department has a disability liaison officer whose role is to act as a point of contact both within and between Departments for information and advice in relation to disability. The employee assistance service plays a valuable role in this regard as does management and staff alike within the Department. Disability awareness training has also been provided to a number of staff in the personnel area.

In this area, the resources available to the Garda have been significantly enhanced in recent years.The deployment and introduction of information systems and other modern technologies to assist the force is a continuous process and there are a number of projects currently under way or recently completed which will add further to Garda resources. Specifically, the PULSE system is available at 181 locations which include divisional and district headquarters and all major city stations. Under this level of coverage, 85% of all incidents are directly captured and over 75% of Garda personnel have direct access to PULSE systems in their own stations. At the same time, training for the system has been undertaken for members in other stations who also have the means to link up with the PULSE network indirectly. Due to the size and complexity of the project, roll-out of the system has taken place in phased releases. It is planned to deploy the final release of the system later this year.

From 14 April, 2003, the operation involves 30 Garda traffic units comprising a total of 473 Garda personnel. The primary function of these units is the road traffic law enforcement operation known as Operation Lifesaver. Other divisional and district personnel also contribute to Operation Lifesaver through their enforcement activities. All uniform members also enforce Operation Lifesaver.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1070	I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, with the exception of the three charter flights referred to in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 408 of 8 April 2003, the precise number of escorted deportations and the level of accompanying escorts in 2002 is not available. I am informed that efforts were made to compile the information but records are not kept in a way that would enable statistics to be provided in the manner sought without a disproportionate level of resources being employed. The Garda national immigration bureau is responsible for effecting removals from the State including the escorting of deportees while on flights. The Garda Commissioner has advised me that all persons being deported are individually risk assessed by the Garda. This prior assessment determines the level of escort, if any, required. Where direct scheduled flights are available and subject to the agreement of the carrier concerned, deportees normally travel unescorted. This does not apply in cases of removal pursuant to the Dublin Convention where escorts are provided because the persons being removed must be handed over on arrival to the local immigration authorities. Where direct flights are not available persons are escorted to, at least, a transit airport. In cases where persons are not in possession of valid travel documents, escorts are required to travel to the point of final destination due to airline and local immigration requirements.Where the risk assessment results in a Garda escort, it is the general policy of the Garda national immigration bureau to allocate, on scheduled flights, two escorts per deportee for the first two deportees in any one group and thereafter one additional escort per additional deportee. The Commissioner further informs me that the Garda national immigration bureau is in the process of drawing up a best practice procedures manual on the removal and escorting of persons being deported from the State. This manual will, inter alia, set out procedures on the number and types of escorts to be used during removal operations.

However, I understand that the matter relates to a person who was fined €200 in court because he did not have a dog licence as required by the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 to 1992 and regulations made thereunder. In the case of fines, the normal procedure is that where a fine is not paid within a specified period a warrant is subsequently issued by the court which is executed by the Garda Síochána. I understand this is what happened in this particular case, and the person was committed to prison for the non-payment of the fine.As the Deputies will appreciate, records of the decision in court cases and the communication of the decision of the court is always in writing to ensure that the correct decision issues to the parties concerned. This is in line with the general method of official communication in this and other states. It is particularly important to ensure that decisions of the court are clearly and correctly communicated to ensure that there is no confusion or error in the decision issued. I have been informed by the Courts Service that, without notification that a person has literacy problems, the courts and Courts Service do not make special provision to provide alternative methods of communication for such a person. Where such problems are notified to the court office, the staff would of course assist by reading out the summons to the person concerned.

The RAPID programme has selected 25 target areas in cities and towns and, in addition, 20 towns for priority investment and frontloading of funding under the National Development Plan 2000-06. While no dedicated Departmental financial allocations have been made to provide potential funding for proposals received under the RAPID programme as such, particular priority is given to RAPID proposals which fall within the functional areas financed under the national development plan. My Department decides on approving funding for RAPID proposals within the context of existing allocations across Votes under my Department's remit. Funding of €3,507,360 has been approved by my Department under the equal opportunities child care programme for child care proposals submitted under the RAPID Programme.

The next meeting of the committee will be held from 16 to 27 June next in New York.In response to a request from UN Secretary General Annan to all UN member states, for views on these proposals for inclusion in his report to the ad hoc committee, Ireland along with our EU partners have submitted a paper setting out a common EU position. Ireland believes that the guiding principle of any new legal instrument in the area of disability should be to ensure that persons with disabilities can better enjoy their human rights. Ireland along with our EU partners will aim to ensure that the processes and outcomes of the ad hoc committee meet this principle. In advance of its next meeting, Ireland will work with our EU partners in an effort to reach a common position in regard to the future work of the ad hoc committee.

The effect of restraint orders made by the High Court is to freeze property deemed to be the proceeds of crime for at least seven years. After that period, a disposal order may be sought from the court to vest the property in the Minister for Finance. It is only where the court directs that such property be transferred that funds accrue to the Exchequer. Having regard to the seven year safeguard period, the issue of such disposal orders has not arisen to date. I would add that local drugs task forces have been established by the Government in the areas most affected by the drugs problem. The Government continues to commit significant resources to these task forces to assist in developing a comprehensive and co-ordinated response to the drugs problem at a local level.

I am advised that planning permission was not sought for either of these developments and that Wexford County Council is considering the service of enforcement proceedings in relation to them.I also understand that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is investigating these developments in relation to foreshore licence requirements.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1087	Stringent quality requirements for drinking water supplies are prescribed by EU and national standards. Local sanitary authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that drinking water meets these standards. This duty is performed under the general supervision of the EPA which publishes a report annually on the quality of drinking water in Ireland and carries out random auditing of sanitary authorities focusing on reported non-compliance with quality standards. The annual EPA report includes data on the quality of drinking water, based on sampling and analysis, and includes the conclusions and recommendations of the EPA as to any action required to redress quality deficiencies. Copies are sent by the EPA to all sanitary authorities and the report is available in the Oireachtas Library.The EPA report for 2001 confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water with an overall compliance rate of 94.3% with prescribed standards, based on 14 principal parameters including aluminium. The report is based on the results of some 146,000 individual tests on over 22,000 samples of drinking water taken from 2,440 supplies, including 6,704 tests for aluminium.The report indicates a compliance rate of 91.3% with the aluminium standard. Aluminium in the form of aluminium sulphate salt is used as a coagulant for colour and colloidal-removal in the treatment of water for drinking supplies. A quality standard of 0.2 mg per litre is prescribed in relation to aluminium in accordance with the WHO guidelines for drinking water quality.

The housing data from the 2002 census forms has yet to be analysed and published. The most recent published census data is derived from the 1991 census, which indicated that there were 81,424 private rented dwellings in the State, of which 36,579 were in the Dublin area as a whole, including 5,261 in Dún Laoghaire Rathdown and 27,928 in Dublin city. The census does not provide data in relation to the number of landlords.Information relating to registration of accommodation and landlords is provided in the quarterly and annual housing statistics bulletins published by my Department, based on returns from local authorities, who have responsibility for maintaining the register. The most recent information is contained in the September quarter 2002 bulletin, which is available in the Oireachtas Library. This indicated that an overall total of 24,983 units nationally were registered with local authorities by 15,787 landlords at 30 September 2002. In the Dublin area as a whole, there were 11,169 units registered by 5,958 landlords, of which there were 1,156 units registered by 827 landlords in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and 9,066 units registered by 4,369 landlords in Dublin city.

In general, the licensing provisions of the Act anticipated the provisions of EU Council Directive 96/61/EC on integrated pollution prevention and control, IPPC, and have delivered substantial compliance by Ireland with the directive, in advance of the deadlines which it contains – some of which extend out to 2007 – and ahead of other EU member states.The Protection of the Environment Bill 2003, which contains a wide range of technically complex provisions, inter alia, makes the remaining necessary legislative changes to complete Ireland's transposition of the directive. The Bill was passed by Seanad Éireann on 1 April last and is now before Dáil Éireann.The European Commission has most recently communicated with Ireland in relation to transposition of the directive by letter dated 17 December 2002 in accordance with Article 226 of the treaty establishing the European Community. A response was sent to the Commission on 5 February 2003 pointing out that the Bill had been published on 30 January.

Persons who are, in the opinion of the local authority, unable to provide for their housing needs from their own resources are assessed as being eligible for local authority housing. Therefore, the type of employment or profession of an applicant is not a factor as such in the assessment of housing need but rather a broad view is taken of an applicant's circumstances.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1093	In December 1999 the Irish Cosmetics and Detergents Association, ICDA, entered into a voluntary agreement with my predecessor for the effective phasing-out, by end 2002, of the marketing of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergent products by ICDA members. ICDA represents some 90% of the domestic laundry detergents market in Ireland.The agreement provides for a phased move to zero-phosphate products by ICDA members as follows: by 30 June 2000, 55% of market share to be zero-phosphate; by 31 December 2001, 90% of market share to be zero-phosphate, and by 31 December 2002, 95% of market share to be zero-phosphate.I am satisfied with the progress that has been achieved to date for compliance with the interim targets and I understand that ICDA was on track in 2002 to deliver the final phase of the agreement. The submission to my Department of ICDA's audited sales figures for 2002 is due at end June 2003 and will provide additional information as to sales trends at end 2002.In a similar initiative, my Department is in continuing liaison with the non-ICDA sector and significant progress is being achieved towards securing a similar phase-out by that sector of the marketing of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergents.The responses of the ICDA and non-ICDA sectors represent a significant and commendable industry contribution to the reduction of phosphorus losses to Irish waters and is an important element of the Government's catchment-based strategy against eutrophication.I have no proposals at present for other similar initiatives.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1095	I propose to take Questions Nos. 710 and 711 together.The 1998 EPA national waste database report contains information on the estimated amount of plastic and glass waste arising in Ireland. It shows growth in waste arising from both waste streams since the previous database report for 1995. However, specific data on the use of plastic beverage containers, or the extent of any switch from glass to plastic over the past decade, is not contained in the report. The EPA is expected to publish the 2001 national waste database report shortly.The recycling of post-consumer plastic beverage containers and other types of plastic packaging is generally more problematic than for other packaging materials, due to the light weight to volume ratio, sorting and pre-treatment requirements, high end market specifications and associated costs involved. Accordingly, the recycling rate of plastic packaging is generally lower than that of other packaging materials.

Forty-five areas are included in the programme. Strand I of RAPID relates to 25 urban areas and strand II to 20 provincial towns. Apart from expenditure on projects, my Department supports the RAPID programme in a number of ways, including the funding of local co-ordinators for each RAPID area, co-ordination of the programme across the Department and ongoing consultation with senior management in the local authorities concerned. In addition, public agencies, including local authorities, are already providing a wide range of services in all RAPID areas. My Department provides funding to local authorities for many of these services.Projects received from the local area implementation teams relate mainly to social housing, local road improvement measures and environmental issues which are delivered on the ground by local authorities. The nature and scale of many of these projects has necessitated extensive evaluation as well as consultation with local authorities and the Area Development Management Limited, ADM, RAPID support team. This evaluation and consultation process is ongoing with a view to progressing projects in so far as possible, in the context of available resources. Approval in principle has been given to the funding of some projects which are in a position to proceed and details, as available, are set out in the following table.

A particular scheme of employment along the lines of the old scheme is not envisaged. Rather I anticipate that the partnerships may offer practical assistance and support to students from disadvantaged areas in finding temporary summer employment in the labour market.I am in contact with ADM and keeping the matter under review.

Details of organisations funded in 2002 will be made available by the end of May. I attach for the information of the Deputy a table outlining the number of applications processed and paid since 1999.While it is not possible to determine the precise cost of processing each application, I can confirm that the administration of the scheme during the past four years, has been supported by staff in ten regional offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.While every effort is made to ensure the prompt processing of applications, the application process can take in the region of three-four months. Many delays occur as a result of the failure of applying organisations to submit satisfactory accounts in respect of previous grants paid or necessary documentation in respect of current grant applications. In administering this and other grant schemes, my Department must ensure that all criteria are adhered to. Applications are processed as quickly as possible once all the necessary documentation has been received.A breakdown of funding under the scheme of community support for older people since 1999 is as follows:Appendix 1

In that context I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Ring's Question No. 240 of 4 February in which I stated that I had made no appointments to State boards since June 2002. For the Deputy's information, I included details of appointments made by the North-South Ministerial Council to An Foras Teanga, a North-South implementation body under the aegis of my Department.The information requested in respect of current and scheduled vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of my Department is set out below.An Foras TeangaAppointments are made by the North/South Ministerial Council.Membership: 24Expiry date of appointments: 12/12/2005.Vacancies: 1 vacancy on Ulster Scots AgencyBord na Leabhar GaeilgeMembership: 11Expiry date of appointments 31/12/04Vacancies: noneAn Coimisiún LogainmneachaMembership: 12The previous commission was dissolved on 31/12/2002 on foot of its advice that there was a need to reconstitute and establish revised terms of reference.

Contracts are awarded to projects by my Department subject, inter alia, to the condition that such legal status applies.Membership of the management committee of a community development project is determined by the articles of association. My Department has no role in regard to nominating members of CDP management committees. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene on behalf of any individual who wishes to become a member of a community development project.

My Department is happy to accept disabled candidates from that office as the opportunity arises.Advertisements for competitions organised by my Department directly clearly state that this Department is an equal opportunities employer.An officer in my Department has responsibility for equality issues including disability matters. It is part of the duties of this officer to ensure that the needs of staff with a disability are catered for.Currently, 3.24% of the staff of my Department have disabilities, eight officers out of a core staff compliment of 247. This is in line with the Government target of 3% for the employment of persons with disabilities in the Civil Service.The recruitment of non civil servants to bodies under the aegis of the Department is a matter for each body. These bodies are however, made aware of the Government targets for employment of staff with disabilities.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1140	Social Welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. In applying the legislation, deciding officers do not treat performing artists any differently to any other unemployment benefit or assistance claimant.Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment. Deciding officers would have regard to the conditions which apply in the employment or line of work involved. However, if there is no employment available in a specialised field within a reasonable period of time, the unemployed person would be expected to broaden his or her search so as to include other types of employment. After a period of unemployment, a person would be expected to accept any employment for which he or she is qualified.The introduction of special arrangements exempting performing artists from the requirements to fulfil the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work for entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance would raise issues concerning consistency of treatment vis-à-vis other claimants to unemployment payments and there are no current plans to make any such change to the legislation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1141	Unemployment benefit and disability benefit are payable to people who suffer a temporary loss or interruption of employment, and where they have "average weekly reckonable earnings" greater than €88.88 in the relevant tax year. Where the applicant's average weekly earnings are equal to or less than €88.88, reduced rates are payable. The reduced rate of payment is determined according to the appropriate earnings band. A carer's allowance, or any social welfare payment, received by an applicant during the relevant tax year is not counted as reckonable earnings for this purpose.Where a person qualifies for benefit at a reduced weekly rate, a top-up supplementary welfare allowance payment could be made depending on means.The inclusion of social welfare payments as reckonable earnings would have substantial implications for the unemployment and sickness payment schemes. It would also have financial implications which would have to be considered in a budgetary context.

The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit from 30 September 2002. In the context of a review of her entitlement in February 2003, she was asked to provide details of her efforts to find work. Based on her response, a deciding officer disallowed her claim from 3 April 2003, on the grounds that she is not genuinely seeking work.It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose was issued to her on 16 April 2003.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

Under these arrangements and with limited exceptions, treatments are provided to patients either free of charge or at a reduced fee and my Department pays the balance of the cost directly to the dentist at the agreed rates.My Department had not been accepting claims during the dispute from dentists who were applying increased patient charges in breach of their contracts. Patients were advised to check that their dentist was continuing to operate within his-her contract with the Department and in cases where this was not so, they were advised to use the Department's lo-call service to get details of dentists adhering to the agreed fees for treatments.Patients were also advised that the Department would not be in a position to refund any costs arising from treatment provided to them as private patients.Patients who received treatment from dentists who were not at the time participating in the scheme did so outside the scope of the dental benefit scheme and they are not entitled to any benefit under the scheme in respect of such treatments.

However, where personal information relating to a third party and information obtained in confidence from another source is involved, it maybe exempt from disclosure.In relation to any record containing allegations made by third parties, generally such information is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003.The Act provides that a request may be refused for records which may either reveal or lead to the revelation of the identity of a person who has given information to a public body in confidence, where the release of the information may hinder the further provision of such information and it is vital that the public body continues to receive such information.

I have made no appointments to the 17 member Pensions Board since 6 June 2002. Vacancies on the board are not due to occur until 2005. At that time, I will, with the consent of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, appoint a new board.I appointed the Pensions Ombudsman from 28 April 2003. This appointment was made on foot of an open competition undertaken by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission.

Her spouse is receiving a pre-retirement allowance, the rate of which is subject to an over-riding statutory limit which restricts payment amounts, in the case of a married couple, to the appropriate married rate. His entitlement is under review in the light of the pension recently awarded to his spouse. He will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers.
