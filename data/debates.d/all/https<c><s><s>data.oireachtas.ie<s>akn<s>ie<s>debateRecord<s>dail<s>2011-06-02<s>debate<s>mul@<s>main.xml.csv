#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with two notices under Standing Order 32.  I call Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.  Is Deputy Healy-Rae present?  As the Deputy is not in the Chamber, I call Deputy Dessie Ellis.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, in light of the recent report by World Health Organisation cancer experts which states that mobile telephone use may increase the risk of certain types of brain tumours, to ask the Minister for Health and Children to comment on what is being done by his Department to ascertain how much, if any, threat is represented by mobile telephone networks to the health of the population.  Millions of people use mobile telephones in this country and many are concerned about transmitters and masts in their area.  I hope the Minister will address this issue.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Having considered the matter, it is not in accordance with Standing Order 32.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Is anything in accordance with Standing Order 32?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	4	However, the Deputy's request reminds me to ask Members to switch off their mobile telephones.  I have had complaints regarding interference with the recording of the proceedings of the House.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Perhaps we could debate that issue.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I ask Members to keep that in mind.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	7	A Cheann Comhairle, I understood it was I, not Deputy Healy-Rae, who was tabled to request an adjournment under Standing Order 32.  I submitted my request last night.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	8	You will have to get in earlier, Seamus.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Deputy Healy must not have a mobile telephone.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	10	What does the Deputy's request relate to?
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	11	It concerns the closure of 400 post offices by An Post.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I apologise, I was given to understand it was Deputy Healy-Rae who wished to make a request.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I have a copy of the notification.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	14	My apologies, the Deputy may proceed.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the policy of An Post to close 400 post offices, including the announcement yesterday of the impending closure of Bansha post office, County Tipperary, thus withdrawing a vital public service from the local community, especially the elderly who are dependent on the post office for pension payments and other necessary services; and to ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to make a statement on the matter.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	16	This matter is not in accordance with Standing Order 32.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	17	It is proposed to take No. 3, Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011 — Second Stage (resumed); and No. 10, statements on Dáil reform.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in regard to No. 10: the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, the statements of other Members called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, Members may share time, and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	18	There is one proposal to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 10, statements on Dáil reform, agreed to?  Agreed.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	19	In regard to primary and secondary legislation and the ordering of business in the House, we know from this week the ability of the Tánaiste and other members of the Labour Party to say one thing in public and to make a totally different commitment in private.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Deputy should be allowed to speak without interruption.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Fine Gael Deputies are defending the Tánaiste.  That must be a consolation to him.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	22	It is not funny.  I ask Deputy Durkan to allow Deputy Ó Cuív to continue.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I apologise, a Cheann Comhairle.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Deputy Ó Cuív is on his feet and should be allowed to proceed.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Given the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn's, solemn signed pledge of less than three months ago to reverse the €500 increase in the student services charge and the €200 charge for post-leaving certificate courses——
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Who imposed those charges?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Deputies must let Deputy Ó Cuív have his say.  The Tánaiste will deal with the matter.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I ask Members to show some respect to the Deputy who is in possession.  Deputy Buttimer, you are always at this.  Would you please stay quiet?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I ask Deputy Ó Cuív to proceed.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Minister, Deputy Quinn, confirmed this week that he will not now reverse these increases and that he is considering——
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	31	A Cheann Comhairle, the Deputy is not asking about promised legislation.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I am coming to that, if the Deputy will be patient.  The Minister indicated he is now considering the introduction of third level fees.  Will the Tánaiste arrange for a debate on this issue and will he confirm whether primary and secondary legislation will be required?I gcomhthéacs an Bille Gaeltachta atá geallta, an bhféadfadh an Tánaiste a dhearbhú inniu nach bhfuil aon bhunús leis na ráflaí atá ag dul thart go bhfuil i gceist laghdú a dhéanamh ar chumhachtaí an údaráis agus na cumhachtaí fiontraíochta a bhaint de?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The latter is completely out of order.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I remind Deputy Ó Cuív that the increases in the student registration charges to which he refers were introduced by his own Government.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	35	We accept that; it is not the issue.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The damage that Government did to the economy——
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Hear, hear.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	38	If Members ask a question they should listen to the answer.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The parties opposite knew all about this before the election.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	40	We do know all about it, and the Irish people know all about it.  That is why they made the decisions they did in the election.  It will take quite some time to undo the damage the previous Government did in education and in many other services.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Hear, hear.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The Tánaiste was more sincere when he was on this side of the House.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	43	There is no legislation promised on the matter referred to by the Deputy.Maidir leis an Bhille i dtaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta, tá reachtaíocht geallta ach ní dóigh liom go mbeidh sé foilsithe go dtí an bhliain seo chugainn.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Watching the antics of this Government in recent times reminds me of "Fawlty Towers".  The latest water charges episode has the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach cast as Manolos, claiming they know nothing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Manuel.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Or even Manuels.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Manolos are shoes.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Can we proceed, please?
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	49	They still know nothing.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Whatever about the Tánaiste's preference for footwear, when can we expect to see legislation on water charges, which the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has stated will be imposed on households from 1 January?  When can we expect to see legislation on the household charge, however it is defined, and will this be part of the budget or a stand-alone measure?  I could ask how the Tánaiste expects people to pay these charges when record numbers are struggling with personal debt but that would be entirely out of order.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Thank you so much.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The legislative programme envisages the electricity (transmission assets) Bill.  This proposes to hand over ESB transmission assets.  The Government has a copy of the Cahill report, which it has failed to publish.  I understand the report states clearly that the handover would be expensive and damaging to the State.  The report also outlines that the State should and can seek a derogation from the EU directive.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Deputy McDonald is talking about the legislation.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I am asking about the legislation in the first instance and, second, whether the Government has sought a derogation from the directive and if the Tánaiste could publish the Cahill report.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I recommend that Deputy McDonald improve the quality of her television viewing.  It is a sad life to be watching reruns of an old, outdated television series.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	56	We have just come in here.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Go ahead, Micheál, Bertie or Brian.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has set out proposals that are under consideration by him.  The proposals have yet to be brought to Government and the Government has yet to make a decision on the matter.  When it does, if legislation is required, it will be prepared and brought before the House.  The electricity (transmission assets) Bill will allow for the unbundling of the electricity transmission system assets and to establish EirGrid in primary legislation.  Consultants were appointed to carry out an independent analysis on the electricity transmission assets and consideration of that is still with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Speaking of reruns, can the Tánaiste imagine how sick we are of seeing Fine Gael and the Labour Party doing an exact rerun of the horror movie that was Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in regard to——
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	60	Deputy Higgins is fairly stuck in a groove himself.  Mao is dead, even the Chinese know it.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I understand that Deputy Stagg is still smarting from being forced to sit over there rather than nearer the seat of power but he must desist.
#ColmKeaveney	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-party	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-dob	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Closer to Deputy Higgins.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The Tánaiste has not cleared up the confusion, from a legislative point of view, about the Government's intention with regard to the new stealth taxes.  Three have been proposed — water, property and the new household utility charge.  What is the legislative provision for these?  Specifically, will the Government introduce legislation this year to impose a water tax on householders?  In regard to these charges, will the Tánaiste explain the Labour Party's shabby betrayal as he cynically abandons another election promise, having said he would not introduce water charges?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	64	We never said that.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	65	There is no confusion.  The question of legislation only arises when the Government has made a decision.  The Government has not made a decision on any of these matters.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has set out the proposals under consideration.  When he has concluded his consideration and brings a recommendation to Government, a decision will be made.  If the question of legislation arises from that decision, it will be prepared and brought before the House.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Like many other Deputies, I attended the InterTradeIreland event at the Mansion House.  It was great to see so many companies trying to create jobs at home and abroad.  One concern raised by a company from my county of Meath was achieving payment for work done.  My understanding is that part of the Construction Contracts Bill provides for this issue.  The Bill has been laid before the House.  Can the Tánaiste tell us when it will be brought before the House?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Government is willing to take the Bill in this House.  It was debated in the Seanad.  We hope to have Second Stage in this House before the summer recess.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The registration of wills Bill would do a great service to the country if it was introduced as soon as possible.  It is overdue and will address the crazy situation where the family of the deceased and the solicitor administering an estate cannot formally establish whether the deceased held a will.  This has been going on for years and I ask that we do some housekeeping to debate the legislation as soon as possible.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I do not see the registration of wills Bill listed on the Government's legislation programme.  There was a Private Members' Bill on this topic in the Seanad.  I will check the position on it and I will revert to the Deputy.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has a commitment to introduce legislation on the reform of local government.  This will consider the undemocratic system of sitting county managers and give serious, powerful, decision-making roles to councillors.  When will legislation on this be introduced?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	71	The Government has a series of reform measures to be introduced.  The reform legislation being given priority concerns the funding of political parties and constituency revision arising from the census.  Legislation on these matters is being prepared.  In addition, legislation is being prepared to provide for an incentive for political parties to encourage an increase in the participation of women in Irish politics, particularly in election to the Dáil.  The issue of local government reform will be considered in advance of the local elections that are not due until 2014.  The heads of the local government services corporate bodies (amendment) Bill have been approved and a draft from the Office of the Attorney General is expected shortly.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Deputy cannot go on like this, he should ask a question.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	76	This is very important with regard to legislation promised within 100 days, particularly the NewERA Bill.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Has the Deputy a question on legislation?

What method is being used to calculate the first 100 days in office?

The deadline for doing so is next week so the clock is ticking.  The Cahill report has not been published but it clearly recommends an opportunity for us to do something which is cost-efficient.  The Government must give this its urgent attention as the deadline is next week.  Will the Government seek that derogation and implement the recommendations of the Cahill report?

There are plans to penalise parties if they do not have a proper balance.  Will that also apply to Independents and how will that be done?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	125	That is a very difficult question to answer.  The Tánaiste should be given the chance to answer it.

In elections after seven years, the gender balance will be 40% to 60%.  The issue of attaining a gender balance in this House is long overdue and it requires legislation.  The Deputy asked how this might apply to Independent Deputies.

Legislation is promised for the credit union sector.  The new deal — as opposed to the old deal — signed up to a programme of consolidation in the sector and according to media reports, this could result in the closure of up to half of the credit unions in the country.  Will the Tánaiste clarify the position?

There has been much discussion about Dáil reform and I would like the guidance of the Ceann Comhairle on the reading of scripts in the Chamber by Members.  It is discouraged under the Salient Rulings of the Chair.  Will the Ceann Comhairle give us some guidance?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	138	In accordance with Standing Orders, a script is only allowed when a Minister is introducing legislation.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	145	That is useful information.  I believe Deputy Higgins has already been called.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	156	That would necessitate legislation, so one could argue that legislation is promised.

The Minister has set out publicly certain issues that are being considered by him and his Department.  As the Taoiseach and I have indicated, these proposals have not yet been considered by the Government and the issue of legislation does not arise until the Government has made a decision on them.

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	165	This Bill is the cornerstone of the Government's plans to restructure the public service and public expenditure.  It lays the foundation for ensuring that value for money is delivered by the Government and State bodies under its remit.  The reason for reforming the public service is to ensure its intrinsic value is recognised.  I regret the private-public divide that has emerged over the past several years.  This divide is largely a legacy of the efforts of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party-Progressive Democrats consortium to pillory people through penal taxation and bad governance.It is important that we recognise the value of our public servants.  As a Member of Seanad Éireann I was a strong advocate and defender of the public service against unjust attacks and unfair commentary and as a Deputy I will continue to defend the hardworking men and women of our public service, who ensure the Government functions properly and that high quality services are delivered.  Two weeks ago when Queen Elizabeth and President Obama visited the country, the men and women of An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and our city and county councils were to the forefront in providing the security and organisation that ensured the State visits were a huge success.In defending the public service, however, I do not claim everything is perfect or that change is unnecessary.  This Bill will ensure increased efficiency in the delivery of public services.  The need for reforming the public service has become a mantra and it is believed reform will be at the top of the political agenda for the next three or four years.  Deputy Durkan noted yesterday that we previously had a Minister who was responsible for the public service.  In one of the Governments I recall as a young person growing up, John Boland had responsibility for the public service.  For the past decade, however, there has been an absence of ministerial oversight or proper adherence to regulations.  The blame for that can be ascribed to those at the top of the Executive, that is, the men and women who sit in the Cabinet.  Their duty was to ensure we had proper governance.  It is time we changed the system of government that has operated for the past decade or more so that we can provide ministerial accountability, responsibility and oversight.    If we see that, the taxpayers will respond.  They have paid for years for the waste of inefficient Governments.  The new Department provided for under this Bill will not only focus on the public service but on the elimination of waste and reform of practices to ensure accountability both within government and the public service.Earlier this week, I attended a meeting in Cork with the county manager.  In one year €3.8 million was saved in procurement and the renegotiation of contracts.  While I welcome the Bill and the Government's commitment to public service reform, this must go hand in hand with political reform and not become tokenism for the sake of optics.  The people voted in the recent election and they have entrusted the running of the country to a group of people who sit in Cabinet.  They received a seal of office from the President and they must show leadership.  Leadership requires being responsible and making decisions to achieve the delivery of a public service that is fit for purpose, to create efficiencies in public expenditure and to establish a new approach to the delivery of services, which will be critical to restoring people's trust in the body politic and in the public service.The Government has demonstrated leadership regarding political reform but we can do more.  We must show leadership as we have been elected by the people to represent them.  That has to happen from the top down rather than from the bottom up because those who can afford to take a pay cut at senior levels should do so rather than introducing pay cuts at the expense of those at the bottom.The legislation is critical to the people's ongoing concern regarding the public service, which will be addressed, but integrated, joined up thinking is important.  That will require a change of mindset.  I am happy the Bill is a fulfilment of a commitment in the Fine Gael manifesto and policy papers prior to the election to create a public office for spending and modernisation, which I hope will lead to a better distribution of the workload and the preparation of proper spending Estimates and expenditure management within the overall envelope over which the Ministers for Finance and public expenditure and reform will have jurisdiction.It is also important that power is devolved to public servants.  We have a good public service, which does great work.  If there is a car crash on the N7 at 4 a.m., public servants working for the Ambulance Service, the Garda, Fire Service and our hospitals will look after the victims.  Great work is done in our schools, particularly for children with special needs, by public servants such as physiotherapists, special needs assistants, teachers and language support professionals who adhere to the public service ethos.  I challenge anybody to examine the services provided by the Cope Foundation in Cork as an example of the delivery of public services and tell me that organisation does not provide an extraordinary service on behalf of those who need it the most.We must recognise, as the programme for Government does, that public service is about serving the people and looking after everybody, not just the notional few or a sectional interest.  It is not about making a profit.  It is important that the Government is accountable, transparent and efficient in its approach.  Power, therefore, must be devolved to public servants to give them the opportunity to demonstrate leadership.Accountability has been missing from many aspects of our governance and public service.  The proposals outlined in the programme for Government are radical and they must deliver results and eliminate inefficient governance while restoring accountability.  Deputy Calleary was committed to what he was doing in his role as Minister of State.  He recognised the importance of the public service, that change was needed and that the Croke Park agreement needed to be delivered on.  However, he was on his own for too long and he did not have the support of all his colleagues in Government.  It is pity the previous Government was not held accountable because if we had been governed properly, we would not be where we are today.In the few weeks the Government has been in power, the Minister for Health and Children has stated there must be a change agenda within the HSE.  He appointed a new board and he has not distanced himself from decisions.  He has been responsible and accountable.  He has taken action and he has not run away from issues relating to the fair deal scheme and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The theme of accountability that pervades this legislation means the Public Service Management Acts and the Ministers and Secretaries Acts will be replaced with a reformulated code of laws with explicit responsibilities.  The old style of politics and Government is over.The leader of Fianna Fáil referred to an end to Punch and Judy politics.  If that is to happen, it must be replaced by a system under which power is designated, roles assigned to Ministers, other officeholders and public servants and people who are given power will know their role, duties, remit and what is within their control and there will be a clear demarcation of responsibilities.  For too long commentators have pilloried, demonised and blackguarded public servants.  That is wrong and it must end.  If we are to have a commentary on our public service, let it be fair, balanced and benchmarked against results.Benchmarking was wrong and it did not deliver what was intended but Fine Gael was the first to say this.  We were given out to and we were told we were anti-public servant.  We are not and we never were.  Within this Government, the public servants have a friend at court who wants to modernise and bring about change and give them a sense that the work they do is important and valued.  However, there must be reform and change.  Deputy Healy stated yesterday the Government was about cutting jobs and pay.  We are not but we live in a new Ireland where the delivery of public service must be more streamlined, provide value for money and be about the people.  Public service is about delivery for the people.I am conscious as a public servant who taught in the classroom that we enjoy privileges in the context of pensions and permanent jobs but many of my former colleagues did not make significant money during the boom.  They did not go berserk and party like others and they are subject to the pension levy, which I regret.  However, following the announcement of the jobs initiative, we have had an uprising by others who have been forced to pay a levy.  It is important that decisions are taken for the common good of all citizens not just those with vested interests which was the hallmark of ten years of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Calleary will disagree with me but that was the legacy they left us.It is important that we get value for money in this time of economic regression in the State finances.  We must obtain value for the money we are expending on behalf of the taxpayer.  The Bill will enhance the role of the public service, put a value on the work of public servants and also ensure accountability for the public purse.  Money was wasted on fancy projects in the past decade by unaccountable Ministers who had a slush fund and who spent it as if they were literally trying to buy votes.  An analysis of the sports capital programme will show what Ministers have done in their constituencies.  I refer in particular to the then Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism who was like the uncrowned king of Kerry who spent money at will in his constituency.  I am pleased we did not have the "Bertie bowl".  It would have been a fitting epitaph to a great ten years of waste and abandonment in the country.  The one good thing the Progressive Democrats did was to say "No" to that.  We have a fine stadium in Croke Park which could still be a national stadium.It is important that the Minister would say to those in RTE who are on exorbitant salaries of in excess of €500,000 that it is time they took a cut.  Could someone explain how those who earn a significant amount of money in RTE are worth €1 million, €700,000, €500,000 or €300,000?  I do not understand it.  It is time those salaries were cut.  We must treat the money as the people's money.  The money we spend is raised through taxes.  Many citizens today are doing their best to stay afloat.  I hope the Minister for Finance will say "No" to AIB if it comes looking for a change in the salary cap for a new chief executive.  We could not allow that to happen.  There are no extenuating circumstances in which the salary cap could be allowed to be breached.Equally, it is important that the value for money and policy reviews and the proposed central evaluation unit will ensure Government spending is transparent, accountable and efficient.  If we need to change our approach to public accounts then we should do so.  We are spending people's money.  That includes all of us.  We are privileged in this House.  We must recognise that we are on reasonably good salaries.  Many people are less fortunate than us — many of them within the public service who are in lower paid jobs who do good work.It is important that we encourage the renewal of the public service.  I very much welcome engagement with the public service unions and all the stakeholders.  We cannot be governed by IBEC, SIPTU or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is not about them.  It is not about sectional interests.  It is about all of us together marrying talents and ideas and doing what is best for people.I very much hope we will have joined-up thinking in the approach to public service reform between various Departments and agencies.  For too long quangos have been created to look after certain areas of Government policy.  We have taken away the power and role of local authorities in some cases.  We have made the HSE unaccountable to the House.  When one tables a parliamentary question to the Minister, one is told the HSE is responsible.  The NRA is another example.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport says he does not have any remit over it.  Likewise with Fáilte Ireland; it is not the Minister who is responsible, it is the board.  We must examine the transfer of roles and duties of certain bodies.The policy agenda is far reaching and radical.  The scope of responsibility for the new Department will be vital in delivering the Government's reform agenda.  We must put the country back on track if we are to get this country back to work again, which is the most critical and important task of the Government.  The Department must deliver on the ambitious programme laid out in the Bill.  Mar focal scoir, because the proposals are necessary and radical the challenges we face must be met.  There can be no obfuscation or hiding.  I hope the delivery of reform in the public service will be achieved in such as way as to recognise genuinely the value of the public service, bring about efficiency, a better delivery of service and a reduction in costs.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I thank Deputy Buttimer for his remarks.  Given my experience in the past year or so I will focus predominantly on sections 8 and 9.  My colleagues, Deputies Michael McGrath and Sean Fleming, have raised concerns about the fiscal side of the Bill which should be addressed.  The Department will face challenges.  I wish to focus on policies relating to the modernisation and development of the public service and ancillary issues.  There is no shortage of reports and reviews into the workings of the public service.  My party was very good at commissioning them but not as good at implementing them.  I welcome the fact that a separate Department has been created for the implementation of public service reform.  It is the only way we will get the job done.  The reform and transformation of the public service is such a challenge that it is up there with where the peace process was in the 1990s in terms of the need for a full, co-ordinated Government approach.  I genuinely wish the Minister, Deputy Howlin, well.  He brings much political experience to the role in terms of his service to this House and previously at Cabinet.  I am available and would like to participate from this side of the House in so far as that is possible.Many Deputies have referred to the current economic crisis.  One of my concerns is that given the Minister will have a role in dealing with the crisis in the economic council and on the public expenditure side, the focus of the Department will once again move away from the public service transformation brief and that it would be an add-on, as it were.  I accept the Minister probably has a personal commitment to the public service element of his brief but given the demands of the job currently that is one area about which I am concerned.  I hope we can do that.There have been many reports and reviews into what has happened to the economy in recent years.  A political price has been paid by my party for decisions taken.  That is clear from the make-up of the new Dáil.  Other players are being investigated in a rather slow way at the moment on their role in the collapse of the banks but the higher echelons of the Civil Service who gave advice and who were paid well to regulate and do various jobs have never had to pay a price.  They were retired or they left on pretty good pensions and they have sailed off into the sunset while many more bear the impact of that advice — good, bad or indifferent.The Bill is primarily to establish the Department on a statutory footing and to put the arrangements in place.  The Minister needs to come back with a second Bill that transforms the role and nature of the relationship particularly between higher civil servants at assistant secretary and Secretary General level and Ministers so we go back to a stage where the Minister takes control and is accountable.  We need the capacity to allow for those at that level to be sacked for lack of performance.  The seven-year contract provides a comfort blanket for non-performers.  I have never come across a situation where somebody was sacked for non-performance at that level of government.  Governments change, but officials remain in position and that is a system that must be challenged.I have long held the view, and I put forward this view as a Minister of State, that appointments to assistant secretary and Secretary General level should be advertised both nationally and internationally.  The old boys' club, which effectively governs the upper echelons of the Civil Service, must be taken apart for once and for all.  We have that opportunity now with the retirement of the Secretary General of the Government.  Many people would relish the challenge of being the top civil servant of this country, particularly given the challenges we face, and many of them could bring international experience that we may need or perspectives that we may not have considered.  This might be preferable to us doing the usual and selecting from a relatively small pool and at some stage in the next few weeks, like the court of cardinals, the white smoke will emanate from Government Buildings and it will be habemus secretary to the Government.  I hope that as an indication of its serious intent with regard to this issue, an open selection can be made.The Government missed an opportunity to do that with the recruitment of the Secretary General for the new Department of public expenditure and reform.  That said, I do not think any recruitment process would have come up with somebody as good as Robert Watt.  I know him from my time in the Department of Finance and know he will bring a fresh approach to the running of the Department, based on both his departmental experience and his private secretary experience, which has sharpened and freshened his perspective.  I wish him well.  However, it would have been a good signal, given this is the Department we are charging with transforming our public service and which we are setting up as a public expenditure watchdog, to advertise the position initially.  I hope the Government takes the opportunity to advertise the position of Secretary General to the Government so as to send a signal that we are looking for the best talent.  Sending that signal internationally, would advertise the fact that we are still open for business and that we are serious about transforming the way we conduct government, permanent government in particular, in response to the current situation.There was some discussion on the Order of Business this morning of television programmes and tastes.  I would think that everybody in this House has probably watched "Yes Minister"  and "Yes, Prime Minister" at some time.  It is quite funny to watch it as a serving Minister, because then one sees oneself in the role, as I did when watching it during my time as a Minister of State.  Unfortunately, Sir Humphrey is alive and well with his excuses and "we could do this" or "we could do the other".  The various scenarios in the series were incredibly well performed.  We now have a chance, in terms of our current position and the need to change everything about governance in this country, both elected and permanent governance, to reshape and remould governance.  I hope the new Department is a start towards that.  However, we need other legislation to change the roles and to change the relationship and the interaction between Ministers and senior public servants in that regard.The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, gave a critical speech to the McGill summer school last year which put forward a number of proposals in that regard.  It would be worthwhile for officials and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to look at that speech and consider its ideas and proposals.  If Deputy Howlin intends to review the Ministers and Secretaries Act, I will also put forward some proposals.Deputy Buttimer made some kind remarks about me.  The reason he was aware of the work I was able to do is because the last Seanad held some excellent debates on the issue of the Croke Park agreement and public service transformation.  I would like to pay tribute to former Senator Joe O'Toole, who retired from the House after long years of service, for his interest in that area.  Even when he moved from the dark side, from ICTU, he remained a channel that could be used, particularly in the run-in to the Croke Park agreement, through his expertise, knowledge and the nuances he brought to the debate.  It was he who initiated the series of debates in the Seanad, three of which were held.  Those debates would be an advertisement for retaining the Seanad because they were constructive.  Party political allegiances and the Punch and Judy practices were left aside and people put forward their ideas and spoke from their different perspectives.  Deputies can imagine the perspective of the then Senator Ross as opposed to those from every other side of the House.  That was the Seanad at its best, but we never have debate in this House on those lines.We are about to establish a finance and public service committee.  It is a bit ironic that the Department of Finance is being split into two shiny new Departments and that we are setting up a Dáil committee under the old system.  I am aware that the Government, as part of its optics, wants fewer committees.  However, if it is serious about splitting the Department, surely it should follow through in the committee structure.  I hope the new committee will set up a public service reform sub-committee so that those of us with an interest in this area can meet to follow through on commitments in the programme for Government, on this Bill and on the enactment of the public service transformation agenda generally.  That would bring about an element of Oireachtas scrutiny to the endeavour and would ensure we keep people on their toes in this regard.  Otherwise, the Minister will come in and respond to questions every month and I suspect the majority of those questions will relate to the public expenditure brief.  I notice that procurement issues come under the Minister's remit in this Bill.  This suggests the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, will no longer be involved in that area.  If Deputy Hayes is to be attached to the Department as a Minister of State, I wish him well.  My main concern is that the public service side of the Department will fall to be the AOB item it has been for so many years.  The establishment of a sub-committee of the finance and public service committee will ensure there is Oireachtas input into ensuring that does not happen.We are nearly a year down the road since the signing of the Croke Park agreement and the establishment of the implementation body.  Obviously, I have an interest in that.  Generally it is working and I am confident that when it comes to the review and the IMF review in September, it will be shown to have delivered savings and we will be beginning to see a reform of practices.  It is unfortunate that the debate around the reforms and the changes required by the agreement has come down to the silly things, such as leave days and checking hours and so on.  These things should have been reformed a long time ago.  These are gone now for many people.  However, there are far deeper reforms happening on a daily basis across government, particularly local government, under the aegis of the agreement.I wish to compliment the implementation body, under P.J. Fitzpatrick, for its quiet work behind the scenes in pushing the agenda and in ensuring the sectoral agreements are very much part of it.  Those at the core of criticism of the Croke Park agreement should understand that the agreement is not a social partnership agreement.  It is not a buy-off for the unions as the old social partnership process had become.  It is an agreement between employers, namely the Government, and those who work for the Government about reform and issues around pay and security.  Those who criticise it do so on the basis of seeing it as the old social partnership, which had run its course.  One area where the implementation body needs to up its standard and mark is in selling the message that the Croke Park agreement is delivering on a daily basis across the service.  The review in September will show that.The implementation and monitoring of the agreement could be taken on by the sub-committee I have proposed.  That would ensure political oversight, which is the missing element of the agreement currently.  There is no political oversight.  Deputy Buttimer is right.  We in government were leaders on this and created so many unanswerable quangos.  We need to start to take the power away from those and back into these Houses in which this committee could have a role.Reform generally has always been at a macro level.  The Government and union leaders signed off on the agreement at Croke Park and said "Off you go".  Only then do those who are required to implement it and change their work processes get to hear of it second, third, fourth or fifth hand.  However, the best ideas for reform and saving money come from those at the coalface.  Although we ran out of time, I tried to get a system going across Departments and agencies of capturing those ideas from the people at the coalface — the nurses, physiotherapists, teachers, SNAs, bin collectors and others out every day doing their jobs — because they are thinking about their jobs and  ways to do them differently.  We have been very poor at capturing that wealth of knowledge and information.I direct the Government to what has been done in the State of Minnesota where Governor Pawlenty made public service transformation one of the missions of his governorship.  He did so by hitting the road and getting the police service, fire service and all the usual suspects to buy into it first without imposing some sort of macro agreement on top of them.  Change happened much more quickly because the buy-in came locally.  It was not just a case of going for the sake of going.  Along with his team of consultants, he went back a second and third time, during implementation and after.  The ownership of the process was not completely removed from the way processes were being delivered, which is what we need to do here.One of the biggest issues facing the Government is to try to get this right.  It needs to use the infrastructure of this new Department to get the transformation agenda right and ensure that the public are getting services delivered.  It needs to ensure the morale of those working in the public service at whatever level increases and they feel happy to go in and do their jobs every day.  It needs to ensure that we have a system that is delivering and using the most modern resources available, which are constantly changing.  One of the greatest examples we have in this House is the Library and Research Service which prepares and delivers papers on Bills to us electronically.  God knows what equipment we will have in five or ten years' time to access information, but our citizens expect that their interaction with Government will be done through IT.  There is so much potential for transformation to come in that regard.We are going through an incredibly difficult period in our history.  The independent review panel report into the Department of Finance makes for some stirring reading and the Government has already indicated there will be further inquiries into what happened.  I would direct anybody to look at that report.  Its preparation involved civil servants, political actors in the Department and various other people.  It was done by politicians and senior civil servants from outside the country.  Their perspective is quite interesting.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has joined us and I genuinely wish him well in this role.  I hope that the public service transformation side of the brief is given the priority it needs and does not get drowned out by the public expenditure side.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I welcome the creation of a senior Cabinet post for public sector reform and sincerely wish the Minister, Deputy Howlin, the very best in his efforts.  Along with the Minister for Finance the challenges and opportunities he faces are some of the most important facing our society.  I agree with Deputy Calleary that arguably they are as important as sorting out the economic mess in which we find ourselves.I support the Bill, but would like to voice some concerns, particularly with the Ministry that has been established.  Potentially what makes the Minister's portfolio so strong could also be its greatest challenge, which is the specific linking of expenditure with public sector reform.  If the Croke Park agreement is an example of what we mean by public sector reform, the new Ministry makes considerable sense because it allows the Minister and his team to discuss changes to working practices in tandem with changes to pay.  My understanding of the mindset used in reaching the Croke Park agreement is as follows.  The union leaders said: "We, the unions, are aware of many inefficiencies in working practices across the public sector.  You, the Government, have cut the salaries of our members, so let's negotiate.  If you give us back the money you have taken away we will change the working practices we all know to be deeply inefficient."  I can understand how this approach and mindset came about.  We have had a legacy of supposed social partnership and we have extraordinarily strong public sector unions.  I also understand there is a pressing need to cut public sector expenditure.  Essentially, we very quickly need to do more with less or at the very least try to maintain public services with less, which is extremely challenging.However, I suggest that approach and mindset leads to public service reform in the most limited sense possible.  It is a negotiation of a change in outdated restrictive working practices for more money.  While that approach may save money, which is badly needed, it will not transform our public services.  Real public sector transformation is not a negotiation for pay versus working practices.  It is a process of real engagement with public sector workers to set a new vision for the Civil Service and for education, health or whatever the service area is in order to identify with public sector workers the barriers to achieving that vision and the opportunities that can be used to achieve it, and supporting public sector workers in overcoming the barriers and in using the opportunities ahead of them.The evidence from around the world is that genuine transformations as opposed to changes in working practices fail most of the time.  The evidence is that 70% of transformations fail.  The failure rate is even higher in the public sector where it is more complex and in systems as difficult as the ones the Minister will need to address.  The main reason they fail is that they overlook the human element.  Of the 70% of transformations that fail, in 70% of the cases the reason is that the human element is overlooked.  In other words, in both the private and public sector, the Croke Park mindset is used, which seeks changes in practices with changes in remuneration accordingly.  However, in both the private and public sectors they do not engage the workers in asking them what they want.  For example, we should be asking if we want one of the best education systems in the world.Contrary to the mindset of the Croke Park deal and much of the national debate on public sector reform that I have heard so far, pay actually plays a very small part in real transformation.  Surveys from all over the world consistently show that workers rate pay as the fifth or sixth most important aspect of motivation and them doing a good job.  As an aside, it is worth noting that the only sector where that does not apply and where it is consistently rated as the single most important motivator is in investment banking.  Ahead of pay, workers all over the world consistently say that the things that motivate them are recognition for the work and being given the space, training and capability to do the best job they can possibly do.  If we want more from public sector reform than increased efficiency, and if we genuinely want to transform public services and have one of the best health care and education systems and one of the best policy-making bodies in the world, we must adopt a much more sophisticated and inclusive approach than that envisaged under the Croke Park agreement.We all know our education system is in very serious crisis.  The latest PISA report shows Ireland has experienced the biggest fall in educational standards in the developed world in a decade.  Some commentators and union representatives have, on television, blamed this on the inclusion of students with special educational needs or students whose native language is not English.  The figures show that this is nonsense.  They show we have had a genuinely serious fall in educational standards.Taking a longer-term view, we must regard the fall in our educational standards as being as important as our debt.  If we do not have an education system that is among the top five in the world within the next five to ten years, we will be consigned to being a second-rate country for decades.  Most would agree with that.  In that context, radical reform of the education system is required.  Negotiating one extra hour of work per week for teachers under the Croke Park agreement for changes in pay, pensions or working conditions will not achieve that kind of reform; it will not really do anything.New Zealand has one of the top three education systems in the world.  I am not suggesting we should adopt its model but we should examine it to give us a sense of what radical reform can look like.  New Zealand's Government announced one morning that its Department of Education was to be closed down and that it was setting up a Ministry for education.  I understand that, of the top 35 staff in the new Ministry, only one had been transferred from the old Department.  I am not suggesting we should shut down our Department of Education and Skills but such steps towards radical reform must be considered if we are genuinely to have one of the top five education systems in the world.My concern with having expenditure and reform on two sides of the same coin is that it may make it very difficult to move beyond the Croke Park mindset, which I accept is very useful, towards genuine reform.  With regard to education, the Croke Park deal involves union leaders, quango appointees and some politicians in rooms around Leinster House negotiating changes in working practices for changes in pay.  The only people who will turn our education system into one of the top systems in the world are the teachers and principals, yet they comprise the only group that is not engaged in the reform discussions.  This worries me but I have no doubt the Minister has thought of this and has all manner of clever ideas to engage with the teachers and principals.We have a peculiar approach to policy experimentation in Ireland.  While I acknowledge Ireland is small, negotiations such as the Croke Park negotiations essentially create changes across the board, for every school in the country.  In other countries, this is not the case.  In the United States, for example, the authorities experiment and engage with school boards, principals and groups of schools in a selected area.  The objective is to let them come up with good ideas.  Afterwards different policy experiments are tried out nationally, or in New York State, for example.  I refer to mentoring programmes and other such initiatives.  An approach such as this might be very useful in Ireland and would allow us to experiment and determine some of the very best policy ideas.I have worked abroad on public sector reform.  I have consistently noted two characteristics of the public servants with whom I have worked.  The first is that pretty much every one of them has a genuine, deep-seated desire to serve the public.  The second is that many of them are very deeply frustrated that they are not able to serve and to realise the passion, energy and idealism that attracted them to the public sector in the first instance.  One hears from them repeatedly that they are not rewarded or recognised for doing good work and that they will not take any risks because if they get something wrong they will be crucified therefor.  I hear the phrase "silo mentality" used a lot.  It implies that teams do not share information with one another across the civil service or within various public service organisations.  Although I have never worked on public sector transformation in Ireland, I have heard the same points being made here.  Anecdotally, I hear the same points being made by colleagues of mine in the Irish public service and by those who engage with it.The great opportunity is to recognise that there is considerable desire and capability within the public service to do the best job possible, as Deputies have stated today and yesterday.  Most teachers want to work in and be part of the best school in Ireland.  All teachers would love Ireland to have the best education system in the world.  This is being prevented partly because unions are sitting between the employer, the State, and the teachers or principals.  I would love to see something happen in this regard that would unleash the full potential of public sector workers.It is in this context that I hope the Minister, in his new portfolio, will be able to move the conversation away from that which regards public expenditure and reform as two sides of the same coin.  If that is the conversation, we will save money but will never create genuinely world-class public institutions.  I hope that what I propose can happen and that we can move the conversation on quickly.  I wish the Minister luck and would be delighted to discuss with him what I have seen work around the world, if that would be useful.

Like Deputy Donnelly, I extend my good wishes to the Minister as he embarks on a project that has never been undertaken in this State.  We are in a pretty bad place economically and it is very difficult to have any discussion in the House without referring to that.  Having listened to the debates of other Members, I noted it is virtually impossible without referring to what has happened in recent days.Everyone has his own outlook on public servants.  When politicians talk about public and civil servants, they talk as if they are excluded from that category.  We do ourselves a disservice when we do so.  I am not one who is agitated by surveys in newspapers.  A recent survey of the pecking order in careers — I do not like using the word "careers" in terms of politics — shows that those of us who have volunteered to enter this House and who are honoured to have been elected are the bottom in terms of public perception.  I always believe public perception is basically reality, whether we like it or not.  It reflects how we are thought about outside the House.This Bill offers an opportunity to change circumstances for the good, not just in terms of civic responsibilities.  While I accept Deputy Donnelly's point on the value of public servants and their desire to do a good job, which he explained very well, the reality is that most members of the public would not share that view in regard to Members of this House. One of the good aspects about this Bill, given the position we are in, is that this Minister has an opportunity of transforming politics not just for our sake, but out of civic responsibility.In terms of the legacy, we cannot blame someone else because the economy is on its knees.  It was some of our own who did that.  We cannot blame on this occasion the British Empire, the Americans or the French.  Those days are gone.  We must take responsibility now for what has happened.I am one of those people who believe we have not always covered ourselves in glory in terms of what we did with our independence.  I admire the Members of past Dála who sat in this Chamber in those early days, and I am not just talking about those in my own party, the Labour Party, but across parties.  In terms of what happened subsequently, we went in a completely different direction in terms of civic responsibility, real politics, morality issues and all of those aspects.  I would have great difficulty in defending much of what has gone on inside this House in modern times and the conduct of some people.  We have to put ourselves in that category and not exclude politicians from public service.When we talk about reforms we should start from the top, and that means us.  We are running the country — some people say we are supposed to be running the country — but when we talk about changing the nature of this House and making savings that could contribute towards getting some of the more than 400,000 people off the live register, that can only be something good but there is a great deal of work to be done in that area.As I said at the outset, this Bill represents a good opportunity and we will all be judged on it, not just people like myself on the Government side of the House but all of us here.  Critics are ten a penny but putting forward rational arguments against what the Minister will bring forward is the responsibility of those in Opposition, and perhaps those on this side of the House also in terms of putting forward feasible arguments for or against this Bill.I wish the Minister well.  I support the Bill and look forward to the transformation this Bill can bring about to politics and to public life.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I genuinely thank colleagues from all sides of the House for what was by and large an informed and thoughtful range of discussions on what is largely a technical piece of legislation.  It is not intended to be a blueprint for reform.  It is simply an enabling structural Bill that will allow the new Department of public expenditure and reform be created and give it a legal presence.It is part of a broad-ranging reform agenda that we had a chance to debate in Private Members' time earlier this week that will involve a substantial change in the public service, the Civil Service, politics, the Constitution and in governance in this country.  I am determined that the expenditure element of my Department which, unfortunately, is a downward pressure on expenditure that I am required to deliver upon, will be done in tandem with the reform agenda which, and I agree with my colleague, Deputy Maloney on this, must be from the top down.  We must have a new mindset on it.  It is not the old way of making the reforms that were done in the past.I was in the Chamber for the latter part of Deputy Calleary's contribution and all of that of Deputy Donnelly.  If I may say so, they are two of the people on the Opposition benches most able to make a constructive contribution.  I acknowledge Deputy Calleary's significant role in breaking ground for the Department that I am now proposing to create.  He left a fine legacy behind in that regard in trying to begin the process of fundamental reform.In reply to Deputy Donnelly, I have said on every occasion I have spoken in this House that I have an open door to ideas and I am looking forward to inviting Deputy Donnelly to meet groups like the Croke Park implementation committee for an external experienced intervention on that.  It is not business as usual on any scale in terms of issues I propose to do.The main purpose of this Bill is to establish structurally the Department of public expenditure and reform and establish me in a legal entity as Minister.  There will be a Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Brian Hayes, who is already undertaking a great deal of work in that regard.I wish to comment on some of the observations made by my colleagues during the course of the debate to date.  I apologise that I was not present for all of it but I have ensured that careful notes were taken of all contributions.  We will be having careful regard to everything that was said, particularly between now and Committee Stage where, if possible, any useful contribution can be addressed.In his opening comments Deputy Fleming tried to characterise my contributions in a negative way.  I will not be drawn into that because we should try to leave that behind us.  The leader of the Fianna Fáil Party's idea about constructive Opposition has been largely held to by Members opposite and I will not allow myself to be drawn into a cul-de-sac of mischaracterisation that represented some of Deputy Fleming's comments yesterday.On his view on the control of appropriations-in-aid, Deputy Fleming is not correct in his assessment.  The Minister for public expenditure and reform will have all the existing powers of the Minister for Finance in regard to appropriations-in-aid.  That is implicit in the Bill.Deputy McGrath referred to the functions listed in Schedule 2 of the Bill.  This Schedule refers primarily to the authority to borrow.  In the current climate, it is appropriate that the decisions on borrowing by State bodies should be subject to the consent of the Minister for public expenditure and reform, as the Minister with responsibility on a sectoral basis for each line Department, and the Minister for Finance who has responsibility for overall Government finances.This is a new way of doing business.  I have just come from a Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure and there is a new cohesion to try to pull the strands together.  The synergies between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and myself in terms of our new roles have been creative and good and they have stress-tested significant ideas in a much better way.  That is how we intend to advance.Deputy Boyd Barrett expressed a very different view of the role of the public service and the size and scale of the public service this country can afford.  I appreciate Deputy Boyd Barrett's aims, which I understand are to achieve excellence in public services, but we do not have the luxury at present to commit the type and scale of resources Deputy Boyd Barrett's policies would require.I noticed in this morning's newspapers that Deputy Shane Ross managed to spin a headline — fair play to him — by characterising my actions to date in three months as pussy-footing, whatever that means.  I will get a chance later this month to present the first tranche of findings from the Croke Park agreement, and I believe they are significant.  We must acknowledge the engagement with the process across all sectors of the public service.I am minded to refer to Deputy Donnelly's comment that the disentanglement of pay is an issue.  For most people pay is a significant issue, and I take what the Deputy said seriously, but people who now feel economically pressured must have some sense of security in their own planning, even if it is for the basic economic reason that we want people to spend now.  That level of assurance is predicated on radical reform.  What we have got to date is significant, but we have to go further.  People know that and I am engaging at every level, and not just with the unions.  In fairness, every line Minister is doing the same.  The Minister for Education and Science engaged with the teacher conferences and this was a start in the process.  People understand how bad things are.  They want certainty, as far as we can give it, on the path forward and on their own income.  Even if it is a bad prognosis, people will buy into it if it is a clear prognosis.  They want fairness so that everybody is sharing and there are no excluded sectors who are onlookers.  We are in the business of regenerating not only the economy, but our society.  There can be no onlookers in that.  Everybody has to be fully engaged in the process and it is my job to do that.A number of Deputies, including Deputy Healy, expressed concern that the reform process was nothing more than an attack on the public service and a cover for indiscriminate cuts.  That is representative of an old mindset that everything is as is.  I think people are getting the message that we are in a dire situation.  We do not have the resources to do all the good that we know can be done.  We have to try to do that good in a different way.  The majority of people understand that, are engaging with that and are bringing about change and reform, even in the workplace.  I will provide mechanisms for that to be heard and acted upon. However, there are people who listen but at the end of the day still demand more resources.  I heard a medical consultant on a news programme last night coming to the conclusion that what we need is more doctors, more nurses, more equipment.  We cannot have that.  People will have to think differently about how to achieve objectives without the demand being that we can only achieve more with more.  We must get a mind frame that achieves more with less.  We must be more productive and do all the things that I, my Department and the Minister of State assigned to my Department have to achieve in respect of supports, IT, human resource management, procurement and so on.We are in an unprecedented crisis.  Even without the added burden of the banking crisis, which added to the fiscal problems of this nation, we would have to make radical changes.  In good times, the sort of changes that we have laid out would be required, but in light of the financial situation in which we find ourselves, they are not only required, but are an absolute imperative.  Savings will have to be secured in all areas of public activity and resources will have to be redirected to priorities that we now set.  I hope this happens in an open, democratic and realistic way.  I invite everybody to be part of that discussion.The programme for Government has set priorities for public expenditure and we are reshaping our spending focus to mirror that.  There must be an element of realism about it.  We will not be able to continue to do all that we are doing at the moment, and we will not be able to do all that we would like to do within the resource envelope that is available to this country in the foreseeable future.  These are real challenges.  People know that we have established the comprehensive review of expenditure.  I am driving that in a new way across Departments and line Ministers have received early wind of it.  By September, we want both the current and capital review to be completed so that they will inform not only next year's budget but also the presentation of a new capital plan from 2012 to 2016.The key question to be asked of all public bodies is whether they are now performing tasks that are essential to the economic and social recovery that we require.  We need to ask ourselves that.  When I was involved in my own party's programme of reform during the run up to the election, I was very conscious that we needed to put the political system under the same microscope as everything else.  For example, I approached the issue of the survival or not of the Seanad with an open mind.  I probably had a predisposition to saying that we could make a case for its reform.  However, if we use the yardstick that we need to apply to everything, then we should ask if Seanad Éireann is doing a job that is absolutely essential and that no other organisation can do.  I came to the conclusion that we could do without it.  We will have to apply that yardstick everywhere.  When I met the chief executives of the semi-State bodies, I told them they were all doing a fine job and working very hard, but that we cannot afford them all anymore.  I told them they would have to examine their own functions at the outset, rather than undergo an external review.  I told them to examine whether they could merge or hive back their core function to their parent Department and so on.  That level of fundamental questioning of all activities of government, public service and public policy must get under way.Reform is essential to this endeavour.  Members have spoken about the Croke Park agreement that commits the social partners to work together to find new and efficient ways of delivering public services.  It is not an end in itself.  There will have to be a review of it to achieve the ambitious targets we have set out.  I am struck by Deputy Donnelly's comments about negotiation and engagement.  This will not be a coercion-based reform.  If we are to have fundamental reform, it must be by negotiation and engagement, and not necessarily by agreement.  We will not always get agreement and the Government must make decisions at the end of the day, but certainly it should do so following negotiations and engagement, so that people have a chance to have their views aired.  If there are different ways of doing things, they should be tested.Deputy Donnelly also mentioned doing things fundamentally differently in respect of education.  That is why the issue of literacy is at the core of education policy in the programme for Government.  The resources devoted to education in the last three decades have increased enormously, but the literacy rate has not.  We have to look at outcomes and test why these things are happening.  The question is not simply about whether we need smaller classes, more resources, more teachers, more special assistants and so on.  We need to figure out what we are doing with all these resources and what is the outcome and value from them when preparing the next generation.  That model has to be applied to health and other sectors as well.I disagree with the contention that the establishment and make up of the new Department, and its relationship with the Department of Finance, will increase duplication and will serve no meaningful purpose.  That is a knee-jerk reaction for people who are resistant to change.  Both political parties in the Government did much research separately in advance of the election.  We in the Labour Party had an expert group working with us on how to bring about reforms.  The diagnosis of both parties separately was that reform could not be pushed unless a Cabinet ranked Minister was put in place with control of expenditure.  That was not going to happen in an economic crisis with a Minister for Finance whose first priority had to be to deal with the macro-economic situation of the country.  The diagnosis for solving this problem was reached by both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party separately.  That is why the programme for Government contains proposals for fundamental change to the Department of Finance, which is now evident in this Bill.I ask people to engage with this new, radical change, which is a signal that we are open to change in and of itself.  The knee-jerk reaction of some contributors, who said the new system involved duplication because it is different from how we have done things since 1928, misses the point.  I would like people to give the new structure, and the Department I head up, fair wind.  This Department will have an enormous responsibility to ensure success in bringing about economic changes and reform of our political system, our public service and our Constitution.I look forward to lots of debates with my colleagues opposite in the committee.  I believe it was Deputy Calleary who suggested an established sub-committee of the joint finance committee, which is a good idea and one I welcome.  However, that is a matter for the committee itself to decide.  There must be a high level of engagement.  When the committee is established, whether it is a sub-committee or a full committee, I will endeavour to ensure it is fully briefed and engaged in all the processes that will fall under my remit when this legislation is finally enacted.I thank all Deputies for their involvement in this debate, and I look forward to its speedy enactment so that my quasi-legitimate status can be resolved.

It is very important not only for this side of the House but for all sides and it has been discussed at a number of Whips' meetings.  We had a similar debate and statements on the committee structure during which I thought some very meaningful contributions were made which we were able to take into account when we established the committee structure.Radical reform of our system of Government will involve changes at constitutional, political and Dáil level.  The programme for Government sets out an ambitious and comprehensive programme for Oireachtas reform.  Dáil reform has been an issue which many Governments have discussed over a number of years, but little in the way of reform has actually been achieved.  This Government will be different.  We propose a radical reform of the way the Dáil operates to make it fit for purpose in the 21st century.The House has two primary functions, namely, to legislate and to scrutinise the work of the Government of the day.  The proposals which the Government will put forward for Dáil reform will address both of these.  While the Government will play its part in bringing forward appropriate proposals, it will be incumbent on the other parties and all Members in the House and to play their part in reforming and modernising Dáil procedures.  Reform of Dáil procedures is essentially one for the House itself which, under the Constitution, has responsibility for making its own rules and Standing Orders.The programme for Government plans to increase the number of Dáil sitting days by 50%.  The length of Dáil breaks at Christmas, Easter, after bank holidays and during the summer will be reduced to help achieve this target.  This year, although the Government had only been appointed the previous week, the Dáil met in St. Patrick's week which has never happened before.  This initial statement of intent of the new Government was followed up by the Dáil having a shorter Easter recess and bank holiday breaks being removed.  In the weeks to come, we will see the Dáil take a vastly reduced summer recess.The programme for Government also proposes to introduce a four day sitting week.  Friday sittings would be used to take committee reports and Private Members' business, except where urgent Government business might be required.  Friday sittings may also see the use of the Dáil Chamber for committees.  This is important as the excellent work carried out by committees is all too often ignored for the more dramatic exchanges that tend to take place in the Dáil.  Moving some committee meetings to the Dáil Chamber may help increase the profile of the work they carry out.The Government is currently in the process of concluding the final touches to the radical reforms that need to be introduced to improve the Oireachtas committee system.  The new system will break with the committee system of the previous Government where committees were sidelined instead of being seen as a central working element of the Oireachtas.  We will have fewer committees but they will be focused on detailed work programmes.  Deputies will be on fewer committees and will have more time to meet the demands and opportunities that the new focused committees will provide.We will establish an investigations, oversight and petitions committee to provide a channel of consultation and collaboration with the Ombudsman and to manage a new public petitions system for redress of grievances relating to public administration or services.  This committee is a new and welcome addition to the committee system.For the new committee system to work, the committees need to have real functioning powers and a committed membership.  The Constitution will be amended to give Oireachtas committees full powers of investigation.  The Abbeylara Supreme Court decision currently limits the ability of committees to hold investigations into crucial issues of public concern and we will hold a referendum to correct this.  Such a change will see the Oireachtas committees given the powers they need to do the job they are asked to do.The vast majority of Deputies in all parties and none want to contribute in a meaningful way to the running of this country and serve the Irish people.  The radically reformed new committee structure will give Deputies and Senators that opportunity.The current system of oral and written parliamentary questions will be reformed to meet the needs of Deputies more effectively.  The programme for Government proposes to increase the time allocated to oral parliamentary questions but reduce the number of parliamentary questions being submitted to one per Member and the Member must be in Chamber when the parliamentary question is reached but may defer the right to other Members to ask supplementary questions and to give the Ceann Comhairle a role in deciding whether a Minister has failed to provide reasonable information in response to a parliamentary question.The extensive over-use of the guillotine to ram through non-emergency legislation as in the last Dáil will be cut back so legislation can be debated in full.  The over-use of the guillotine in the last Dáil was one of the great frustrations for Deputies of all parties because they were denied the opportunity to have their voices heard on vital issues passing through this House.  However, there will be occasions when the guillotine will have to be used.  As Chief Whip, I will try to reduce them to a minimum because all legislation should be debated in full and all Deputies should have the opportunity to contribute, whether they are in favour or against the legislation going through the House.  Next week we will have to guillotine a Bill and it will be up to the Whips to reach agreement on it, although Deputies opposite may oppose it and push it to a vote.A petition system to the Dáil will be established similar to that operating in the European Parliament to be managed by a specific committee.  The Adjournment debate format will be updated, renamed the topical issue debate and moved to a more suitable time on the Dáil timetable.  This new system will allow Deputies to raise issues of concern in the Dáil and to be provided with a more comprehensive reply from the Government.  Deputies should be allowed to ask supplementary questions.  Under the current system, a Deputy makes a five minute contribution while the Minister gives a five minute reply.  There is no provision for a Deputy to ask a supplementary question.  It is very important that the current system is totally overhauled and that a Deputy has the opportunity to ask a supplementary question.  Members opposite and the party Whips have very strong views on that and it can be worked on.While the Government will drive the process of Dáil reform, it is a shared responsibility of all the parties in the House.  Through their Whips, the parties and the Technical Group have the opportunity to work out common positions on a range of issues, including Dáil reform, with the Government so that as a House we can embrace the idea of Dáil reform in a way that is as far removed from party politics as possible.I, along with the deputy Chief Whip, Deputy Stagg, have been in discussions with the three Opposition Whips regarding the introduction of a number of wide-ranging Dáil reform proposals.  Those discussions have been frank, open and useful.  It is clear from them that we have agreement across the political divide on the need for Dáil reform.The Government wants to work with the Opposition to set out the details of the changes we need to introduce to meet the shared responsibility we have to reform the Dáil.  We are determined to see real Dáil reform early in this Dáil and not have a repeat of the past where plans for Dáil reform were discussed for months only to be left sitting on a shelf.This Government is committed to significantly reducing the size of the Oireachtas.  In response to the recent census results, which will be published shortly, the Government will establish a boundary commission which will review the new census and address the issue of the number of Deputies in this House.When, as leader of the Opposition, the Taoiseach spoke about the abolition of Seanad Éireann, it resulted in much debate not only within the confines of the Oireachtas but outside it.  A single Chamber Parliament would create a Parliament that is more effective, efficient and in tune with our democratic ideals.  Sweden, Denmark and New Zealand have all abolished their second houses to create single chamber parliaments.  When the Taoiseach announced the proposal to abolish the Seanad, there was opposition from other parties but within 18 months, they were all singing from the same hymn sheet.  I have no doubt the proposal will be debated in full when the legislation comes before the House in advance of a referendum.In the course of the contributions from Deputies today, we will see the concept of shared responsibility for Dáil reform embraced in full with suggestions and recommendations and I welcome this.  It is nice to see new Members of the House put forward their ideas.  I have been a Member of the House for the past nine years and one can get caught up in the runnings of it but it is refreshing to see new Members.  If new Members believe there are other ways to have more meaningful debate, I would be very open to their ideas.  Today's statements provide an opportunity for members of political parties and Independents to come forward with their ideas and share them with us.  The Whips are a responsible group and we want to put together the best reform proposals.  I hope to have a package of reforms ready to change standing orders before the conclusion of this session so they will be up and running when we return after the summer recess.These changes will ensure a far stronger Parliament where different groups and organisations will be held to account, which they have not been in the past.  We have drastically reduced the number of committees.  In the last Dáil some Deputies were members of two or three committees.  They often had to race from one meeting to another and barely had time to review agendas let alone examine the issues being discussed.  They were there for the sake of numbers rather than to enhance the quality of debate.  Confining Deputies to membership of one committee means they will have a greater focus on the issues arising in that committee.  I look forward to the contributions of Members opposite and on this side of the House with a view to ensuring we have a better debating Chamber.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I thank the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kehoe, for including this issue in today's business.  The other Whips and I have been engaging with the Minister of State on this matter in a constructive way and have had some useful meetings.  We might not have met as extensively as may be necessary before these matters are formalised, but we have met with a sense of good will and determination to achieve reform.  We accept the Minister of State's point that there have been many years of talk of reform but very little delivery.  I am sure I speak for the other Whips when I say that we on this side of the House will enthusiastically support the concept of reaching a degree of agreement on this before the summer recess so that some measure of effective reform can be put in place when the House returns in September.I am mindful that we had a similar debate some weeks ago on the issue of reform of the committee system to which Members on all sides of the House contributed.  I regret to observe that very little of what was offered by Members on this side is included in the proposals for a new committee system to be established next week.  If this debate is to be meaningful there must be tangible proposals from this side included in whatever package of measures on Dáil reform is eventually agreed.I take this opportunity to pay tribute to a former Government Chief Whip, the late Séamus Brennan, who, on the basis of his 1999 document, A Dáil for the New Millennium, was the last person in that role to achieve any meaningful reform of the Oireachtas.  Fianna Fáil has considered the current agenda for changes to the Dáil's work schedule and we have major concerns about the Government's intentions.  In particular, we are concerned that some of the proposals could seriously damage the practical accountability of the Taoiseach to the House.  The reality of three months of the largest Government majority in the history of the Dáil is that the Opposition will be further marginalised and accountability reduced unless significant reforms, especially in respect of parliamentary questions, are implemented.  The efforts under way by the Government to transfer, disqualify or ignore questions are a bad omen for the working of this Dáil.Formal changes in procedures and increased sitting days will only represent reform if the Dáil is dealing with substantive measures and if the Government respects the right of the Opposition both to ask questions and to have them answered comprehensively.  The proposal from the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip of having the Dáil sit for 35 weeks per year is something of a sham and a publicity stunt.  When one analyses the sittings of the House for the periods 2008-09 and 2009-10, respectively, it is shown that on both occasions it sat for 35 weeks.We support the intention to increase sitting days but would contend that more could be done on Tuesdays.  The Taoiseach has said he is willing to consider moving Cabinet meetings to Monday to enable the Dáil to operate before 2.30 p.m.  We have suggested that the topical issue debate, for example, could be dealt with on Tuesday mornings.  Equally, it would be possible to have Question Time before lunchtime on Tuesdays, with the Order of Business to be held in the afternoon.  This would allow time for more substantive legislative sessions and other business on Tuesday afternoons and evenings.In January 2006, Fine Gael and the Labour Party issued a joint policy document, A Ten Point Programme to Make the Dáil More Effective — Agreed Proposals by Fine Gael and Labour for Dáil Reform.  It states: "Fridays should constitute real sitting days, and should include an Order of Business and Question Time."  I seek clarification from the Minister of State on this matter.  Fianna Fáil is supportive of extending the working week to include Fridays but only on the basis that real and meaningful business is transacted.  We must not have a situation where we are treated to a series of committee reports.  We want to see Question Time and legislation dealt with on Fridays.Following the debate on committee reform we on this side of the House were chastised for not coming forward with specific proposals.  On this occasion, therefore, I propose to outline our specific proposals in regard to the reform agenda.  The Order of Business should deal with both future arrangements for sittings and that day's business.  As such, the current rules are appropriate, with one significant change, namely, that any votes on the day's business should come after, and not before, Deputies have an opportunity to ask about intended business.  Standing Order 26 should be amended to reflect this change.All measures before the House should continue to be amenable to a vote and not limited to a single vote.  The existing Standing Orders adequately allow for the Chief Whip to answer questions on Thursdays.  Therefore, we do not see the need for any other changes to the duration or rules governing the Order of Business.  Where it is not on the Order Paper for that week's Private Members' time, a Member should be enabled to withdraw a motion or legislation from the Order Paper at any time and in writing without having to raise it in the Chamber.  This will allow for a more up-to-date Tuesday Order Paper.The constraint which the inappropriate grouping of questions places on Deputies has got so far out of hand that even the Taoiseach has admitted that he should review his actions in this regard.  This is particularly an issue where the amount of time available to individual issues is dramatically curtailed by grouping.  Standing Order 40 should be amended to require that at least 24 hours' notice be given to Deputies of any intention to group a question or questions asked by them with three or more questions.  In addition, Deputies should have the right to appeal to the Ceann Comhairle against such a grouping where they believe the subject matters addressed in the questions cannot reasonably be related to each other.Regarding how Ministers answer questions — an issue that is raised in the House all the time — the programme for Government is absolutely clear in its commitment to "introduce a role for the Ceann Comhairle in deciding whether a Minister has failed to provide reasonable information in response to a question".  We object strongly to the Government's attempt to back out of this commitment, especially given the tactics being used nearly every day to avoid answering questions.  Priority questions are an essential tool of accountability and we do not support any amendment to current provisions relating to them.  We strongly object to the proposed rule that a Member must be present when a question bearing his or her name is called.  This would undermine the effective operation of accountability on the part of Opposition spokespersons and would ignore the impact which other representative business can have on Deputies at short notice.A new Standing Order should be introduced to the effect that the Ceann Comhairle may rule that a member of the Government has failed to address a clear question asked by a Deputy.  We accept it cannot be required that the answer be to the Deputy's satisfaction, but the subject matter of in order questions must at least be addressed, even where this amounts to a statement by the Minister that he or she does not wish to answer a particular question.Standing Order 34 should be amended to ensure that a member of Government is accountable for all personal acts as a member of Government rather than those areas where he or she has administrative responsibility.  It is unacceptable that the Taoiseach is refusing to answer questions about statements and meetings on the basis that another member of Government has responsibility.  Standing Order 35(3) should be amended to remove the limit on repeat questions where a question has been grouped with two or more other questions.  Standing Order 35(3) should be amended to reduce the repeat period to one month.  If the answer is unchanged this will involve no additional cost but it avoids a situation where Ministers can fail to answer a question properly and the issue is ruled out of order for the following four months.  Standing Order 35(6) should be removed as an unreasonable limit on the ability of Deputies to get direct answers to serious issues if those issues are being dealt with by way of debates at the same time.  Standing Order 42 should be amended to add the words "or matters raised during the course of the reply of the member of government" after "information requested".  This will formally acknowledge the right of Deputies to respond when a member of Government raises side issues in replies.We strongly oppose moving away from the holding of two separate sessions for questions to the Taoiseach.  The experience from the United Kingdom is that this has led to a major diminution of the accountability of the Prime Minister.  The more fundamental issue is not reducing the sessions but ensuring the Taoiseach shows some commitment to answering the questions asked.  Standing Order 37 should be amended so Members may request that any matter not reached at the end of questions to the Taoiseach on Wednesday be answered in writing.  We do not support other changes in this area.  In line with the proposed change to Standing Order 34, the Taoiseach should cease transferring questions that directly relate to his official actions.Private Members' time should continue to have a reasonable priority in scheduling.  We do not support moving its start times any later than the current arrangement.  Given that Government is entitled to bring matters to a vote after less than three hours of debate, the Opposition should be entitled to bring up separate matters on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, providing that a motion be required before a matter is brought to a vote following less than three hours' debate.  Where a motion or Bill is handled in this way, speaking slots should be adjusted to ensure fair speaking opportunities on both evenings.We strongly support the move from the traditional Adjournment debate to having debates on topical issues in the Chamber.  We had some useful engagement with the Government Chief Whip and the other Whips on how this might be handled.  We have submitted proposals in this regard.  These topical issues should be dealt with on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.  It is essential that the relevant Ministers are present in the Chamber to address these matters.  We will seek assurances from the Government that this will take place.  We concur with the outline of how this will be dealt with — five minutes for the question, a five-minute response and supplementary questions for three minutes.We support a longer and more productive working week.  We want to see reform and we are agreed in principle that agreement must be reached before the summer recess so the measures can be introduced in September.  Having reached agreement on a set of initial reforms, the option should exist for Whips, parties and Members to participate in a review of the amended arrangements after six months.  We can then evaluate how effective the arrangements are and whether they provide the opportunity for this House to be more workmanlike, productive and effective.

Ba chóir dúinn a chinntiú go n-oibríonn an Dáil chomh héifeachtach agus is féidir.  Mar pharlaiminteoirí, ba cheart dúinn an méid ama atá againn a úsáid chomh héifeachtach aguis is féidir.  Ba cheart dúinn déileáil leis an Rialtas chun an obair atá os ár gcomhair a dhéanamh i gceart agus mar is cóir.  Bhí díospóireacht spéisiúil againn aréir ar rún mar gheall ar leasú a dhéanamh ar an tslí ina bhfuil an Dáil á reáchtáil againn.  Nochtaítear roinnt tuaírimí spéisiúla.  Cé gur ait liom fós go raibh an rún os ár gcomhair, glacaim gur thug sé deis dúinn am a chaitheamh ag déileáil leis an gceist seo.  Tá a lán rudaí ann.B'fhéidir nach dtuigeann roinnt de na Teachtaí nua conas go díreach a oibríonn an Dáil ina iomlán agus conas atá am na Dála leagtha amach.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil míthuiscint orthu maidir leis an tslí ina ritheann an Dáil.  Nuair a toghadh mé don chéad uair i 2002, shíl mé go raibh na rialacha agus an tslí ina leagadh amach obair na Dála ait.  Cosúil le go leor daoine eile, cheap mé gur chóir go mbeadh Teachtaí in ann teacht isteach sa Dáil agus an méid gur mian leo — nach mór — a rá ar chuile ábhar a thagann os comhair an Tí.  Tar éis tamaill, d'aithin mé go raibh sé de chead ag na 165 Comhalta eile labhairt ar gach ábhar freisin.  Thuig mé go raibh gá dá réir, an tam a roinnt go cóir.  Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil ról ag na hAoirí agus an fáth gur chuir mé i gcoinne an rúin a mhol an Grúpa Teicniúil aréir.  Bhí na Teachtaí sa ghrúpa sin ag iarraidh fáil réidh leis an gcóras Aoire atá againn.  Is é sin an fáth go raibh mé ina choinne.  Tá bealaí ina féidir linn athruithe a dhéanamh ionas go mbeimid níos éifeachtaí sa ról atá againn agus go mbeadh an Dáil níos éifeachtaí sa ról atá aige.Measaim gur chóir dúinn díriú ar an méid ama a suíonn an Dáil.  Aontaím gur chóir cur leis.  Molaim gur cheart dúinn suí maidin Dé Máirt, seachas teacht anseo ar an Aoine.  Tá an chuid is mó den phobal ag rá nach bhfuil seachtain iomlán oibre á dhéanamh againn.  Tá éileamh i measc an phobail go suífeadh an Teach seo ó Luain go hAoine.  Tá an dream ceanann céanna ag iarraidh go mbeadh Teachtaí Dála ar fáil ina dháilcheantair féin maidin, tráthnóna nó oíche.  Bíonn siad ag gearán nuair nach ndéanaim freastal ar chruinnithe poiblí sa cheantar nó déileáil leis na grúpaí áitiúla.  Caithfidh tuiscint níos mó a bheith ag daoine ar an dá thrá atá á fhreastal ag Teachtaí Dála.  Tá ról amháin againn ag déileáil le reachtaíocht agus an Rialtas, agus ról eile ag déileáil leis an bpobal a thogh sinn.  Aontaím gur chóir níos mó a dhéanamh chun fáil réidh le clientelism.É sin ráite, caithfimid déileáil le grúpaí, comhlachtaí, lobby groups agus gach uile duine go háitiúil agus go náisiúnta.  Tá an ról sin againn mar Theachtaí Dála.  Muna ndéanfaimid an plé sin le grúpaí agus leis an ghnáthphobal, beimid istigh i bubble anseo agus ní bheimid i dtiúin leis an méid atá á rá lasmuigh.  Caithfear am a thabhairt dúinn le haghaidh sin.  Má táimid chun suí anseo cúig lá sa tseachtain, déanfar gearradh isteach ar an ról sin go háirithe.  Tá sé éasca dom os rud é go bhfuil cónaí orm i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Is féidir liom teacht isteach anseo ó mo dáilcheantar i leathuair a' chloig.  Caitheann daoine eile sé uair a' chloig ag taisteal anseo agus sé uair a' chloig ag dul abhaile arís.  Caithfimid bheith an-chúramach gan praiseach iomlán a dhéanamh de.  Ní chóir go dtiocfadh dream iomlán nua isteach anseo ag gach toghchán toisc nach raibh na Teachtaí a bhí in áit in ann déileála leis an méid a bhí ag tarlú ina dháilcheantair agus lasmuigh den Dáil.Impím ar an Rialtas, má tá an méid ama a suíonn an Dáil le méadú, é a dhéanamh sa tréimhse ina bhfuilimid ag suí cheana féin.  Ba chóir dúinn cur leis an am a suíonn an Teach seo ar an Máirt.  Más gá dúinn suí níos déanaí ar an Mháirt, an Céadaoin nó fiú an Déardaoin, in ainneoin go bhfuil clann againn, ba cheart é sin a dhéanamh seachas bheith ag teacht anseo ar an Luan nó an Aoine, ach amháin i gcás éigeandála.We would come here on a Monday or Friday only in an emergency, which could arise every now and again.  In the main we would extend the time we sit on a Tuesday to allow for debates on reports and other issues which should be discussed in the House but which do not require every Member, the Cabinet or the Taoiseach to be present.  Time must be set aside to debate many of the urgent reports  and inquiries which have been commissioned by this House.  Some of the work can be done on a Tuesday morning without cutting into the time allocated for Cabinet meetings, etc.A number of good suggestions have been made over the years on changing the Dáil and making more effective use of its time.  Currently, all amendments to Bills likely to lead to a charge on the Exchequer are automatically ruled out of order, although some may be beneficial rather than costing the State money.  As an Opposition we cannot put forward such amendments, although we might hope that a Minister would welcome the suggestion.  Given the times we live in, we should look again at the restriction on the Opposition.  We should be able to make reasonable suggestions for amendments to legislation, even if they involve financing.Teachta Ó Feargháil mentioned the debating of topical issues and moving the Adjournment debates to an earlier time.  I fear that if that happens we will end up with key spokespersons jumping on this opportunity to highlight major issues.  Currently, matters on the Adjournment deal with national or, more likely, local issues requiring a ministerial response.  When debates on topical issues are introduced, they should not become an extension of Leaders' Questions involving key spokespersons.Some changes can look good on paper but after a while they might replicate some of the problems we have already.  For example, there is a suggestion of having 30-second questions in the slot currently used for matters raised under Standing Order 32.  Every morning a number of Deputies propose to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to deal with issues.  Perhaps those ten minutes could be used for asking 30-second questions.  That would allow ten topics to be discussed very rapidly.The following reform issue has been discussed for the nine years in which I have been a Member.  How do we make the various bodies to which power has been ceded accountable to the Oireachtas?  They are called quangos by some people but how can we make them answerable through parliamentary questions in some format?  We must draft legislation dealing with the matter, and it would not be beyond the abilities of those formulating legislation to deal with the issue quite quickly.  It would be a good result of Dáil reform if we could make the various quangos accountable to the Parliament.  They are required to be responsive to the Dáil but they should be more responsive than just issuing an annual report or visiting a relevant committee once a year.I apologise for missing the contribution of the Government Chief Whip as I was with a delegation visiting the site of the national monument at Moore Street.  I hope this Government will extend, secure, refurbish and redevelop the monument appropriately in time for the 2016 commemoration.  I understand the Chief Whip referred to the overuse of guillotines to ram through non-emergency legislation in the Dáil.  The use of guillotines to ram through any legislation, even emergency legislation, should be resisted as much as possible.  Nevertheless, we will see next week the first use of a guillotine since the Government was formed.  I urge the Government and the Chief Whip in particular to avoid such action.  If that means extending sittings to accommodate as many people as possible and having more time shared between Members, so be it.  That would be more appropriate than using a guillotine.Over the years legislation has been produced quickly and rushed through the Houses.  Next week we are to have a social welfare Bill that has not yet been published.  I have argued time and again here that there is a danger of rushed legislation returning to haunt the Government.  I urge the Government to provide at least two weeks, as it has in the past, for Deputies to peruse and properly examine legislation in order to ensure it is effective.  As Deputies we should be able to ensure legislation is correct.  That job of work is before us.I mentioned in last night's debate the booklet entitled Regulating Better, which the Government should consider to see if the regulatory impact assessments can be carried out prior to the publication of legislation.  When the heads of some Bills in the last Dáil were prepared, they were sent to committee so there could be hearings.  That was a useful tool and the legislation emerged at the end of the process, when the time was taken by the Department to put the heads before a committee and there was a discussion.  Such legislation was often much better than examples produced in the orthodox way, meaning it could go through the Dáil much more quickly as time was taken to examine the issue in detail.  I urge the Government to consider publishing the heads of a Bill when agreed by the Cabinet so we can begin the discussion.  That allows us carry out our work and help the Government see where mistakes are likely to appear.There were other interesting proposals for reform in the last Dáil.  One idea looked to ensure that the Taoiseach would be accountable to the Dáil.  There are various views on this and once a new Government takes office, it is normally more protective of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach should be accountable to the Dáil on any day that it sits, even if that is from Monday to Friday.  He should be present in the Dáil as much as the other Deputies, despite his different role.One of my proposals to make Taoiseach's Questions more relevant is to require written answers to any questions that remain unanswered at the end of the week.  This would mean new questions could be raised the following week rather than allowing questions to remain tabled for several weeks.  At present, questions can be out of date by the time they are reached, which makes for a stale debate.  My proposal would speed up the process as well as ensure questions are more topical.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I will start on a positive note by welcoming the Government's response to some of the concerns expressed by the Technical Group and others regarding its initial proposals on Dáil reform.  The Minister of State outlined substantial improvements to his initial proposals on Dáil business and there appears to be a genuine willingness on the part of the Government to take on board our suggestions.  The topical issues slots that are proposed to replace the Adjournment debate are welcome, as is the fact that they will be scheduled reasonably early in the day.  It is hoped these debates will bring more vibrancy and topicality to our business and perhaps end some of the frustration Deputies can feel when they try to raise topical issues on the Order of Business.  I also welcome the reversal of the Government's initial decision to cut back on the period of time during which the Taoiseach will be available for questions in the Dáil.  It is critical that the Taoiseach continues to be accountable to the public through this House.Question and answer sessions should be routinely included before the conclusion of debates on legislation and topical issues.  A number of Deputies have pointed out that debates often follow a model which involves set statements and a relatively small number of Members in the House at any time.  The Minister is often not present to hear the questions raised during the course of the debate.  While this is inevitable in the context of a debate that continues over several sessions, it would be useful to conclude with question and answer sessions so that Deputies could directly interact with the Minister.In the context of yesterday's debate on the Private Members' motion on political reform, I suggested that we should loosen what is allowed during the Order of Business in terms of asking about future schedules for the Dáil and requests for debates.  The rules on the Order of Business are restrictive and it becomes a circus with Deputies trying to negotiate their way around the strictures.

That frustration is felt across the House during the Order of Business.The Government's proposals represent improvements which should make this a better and more responsive Chamber for debate and allow us to raise topical issues.  Credit where credit is due for this, although the Technical Group should take some of the credit for putting forward this week's Private Members' motion on political reform.  Even though the Government chose to delete the motion and replace it with its own programme for reform, it nonetheless appears that some of the points we raised were taken on board.

It does not matter, however, because the important outcome will be the genuine improvements that can be made.  A long way remains to be travelled in terms of real political and Dáil reform.Even if it would not be popular in this Chamber, an initiative to address the question of politicians' pay would receive the support of the majority of people in this country.  Much of the alienation the public feels about the political system arises from the perception that politicians live in a different world from those they purport to represent.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I support reducing it and that is why I am raising the issue now.  Members of the United Left Alliance have volunteered to take only the average industrial wage and the rest of the money goes into the campaigns, issues and organisations with which we are involved.  We did not make this decision because we are saints or martyrs but because putting politicians in the same situation as the majority is the best way to make them truly representative of society.  It puts them in a position in which the decisions they make on increasing taxes or cutting pay will affect them as well as others.  Politicians would thus have a vested interest in championing the interest of the majority rather than the current situation, where their pay is closer to the wealthier sections of society and, despite the best intentions that may exist in the heads of individual public representatives, their material reality puts them out of touch with ordinary working people.This proposal is more relevant than ever at a time when savage austerity is being imposed on ordinary working families and the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.  The austerity measures mean they are struggling to make ends meet and are threatened with an impossible financial burden.  Politicians would think twice about the policies of austerity and cutbacks if they were in the same financial boat.  Although I doubt the majority of Members of this House would consider following the example of the United Left Alliance of reducing salaries to the average industrial wage, the salaries of Deputies, Ministers and the Taoiseach are high compared to our European counterparts or most other public representatives elsewhere in the world.  We should consider reducing politicians' pay by a substantial amount in order that it is more in line with that of ordinary people in our society.I would counterpose that proposal with the Government's proposal to reduce the number of Deputies.  As Deputy Pringle pointed out yesterday, parliamentary representation in Ireland is on a par other European countries.  In other words, the number of public representatives per head of population is the same as most European countries.  The notion that we have too many is not the problem and, therefore, reducing the number of Deputies is not the way forward.  It would be better to cut pay and put us in the same material position as those we represent rather than cut the number of Members.I congratulate the Government on moving to abolish the Seanad.  That would be a positive move because it is an elitist institution.  The notion that we would have a second tier of government based on an elitist electorate with the majority of our society excluded from voting is obnoxious to any democratic sentiment or impulse.  The abolition of the Seanad is welcome and long overdue.  However, while this would be a positive move, we need other democratic tiers to oversee the Dáil.  This also relates in a way to local government.  Most people accept powers must be devolved, whenever possible, to the lowest level of society in order that ordinary citizens can participate as much as possible in decisions affecting them and we can move away from a centralised political system.I propose that we seek to develop a second tier of democracy, different from the Seanad, which is genuinely representative of all sectors of society.  Groups such as We the Citizens point in this direction with its proposals for citizen assemblies.  However, we could formalise and institutionalise that notion with citizen assemblies taking place locally and having representatives from all sectors of the community, including trades unions, students, workplaces, young people, pensioners and people with disabilities.  They could, in turn, elect people to higher bodies at regional and national level.  Representatives of those assemblies would not be professional politicians but they would be directly accountable and recallable.There would not be, therefore, set terms of four or five years where they could get elected on the basis of saying one thing and then implementing or pursuing different policies once they were elected regardless of what they said to people when they were seeking their votes.  The fact that politicians will say one thing at election time to secure votes and, shortly afterwards, do things differently once they are in office is a sore point for people.  We need a mechanism of accountability and recallability for both representatives of citizen assemblies and sectoral-based assemblies at local, regional and national level and Oireachtas Members.  We should be subject to the same terms if we fail to implement the promises on which we were elected.While all the proposals made by the Government, myself and others during this week's Private Member's business and this debate could be positive, they are meaningless in the context of the bigger issue facing the country.  Shifting deck chairs on the  Titanic comes to mind.  By signing up to the IMF-EU package, we have handed over our democracy.  No matter what is debated in the House or any other institution we seek to create, it will be undermined and negated by the fact the EU and the IMF are dictating policy to the Government to pay back the bankers and speculators who caused the economy to crash.  Although I expect the call will fall on deaf ears, even at this stage I urge the Government to think again about tying us into a deal that is fundamentally undermining and destroying our democracy by handing control of policy and economic policy, in particular, over to people representing bankers and speculators rather than the ordinary citizens of this country.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I wish to share time with Deputy Donohoe.This is my maiden speech and I hope the Chair will indulge me with a few thanks.  I wish to thank the people of Laois-Offaly for electing me to represent them.  It is an honour and privilege to be here.  My husband, Seamus, my children, Evan and Rebecca, my extended family, friends and campaign team and all who contributed so much to my success and that of Fine Gael are all in my thoughts today.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the 31st Dáil across all parties and none in the years to come with energy, enthusiasm and optimism.  In this House, we are united with one goal in mind.  We want to help make Ireland a better place for our people even if we do not agree on the means to do it.Ireland faces many challenges, including how to manage our finances, how to get more of our people working, how to ensure equal access to our services for all especially for people with disabilities, the elderly and the vulnerable, how to ensure that our rural economy is supported, how to combat crime and how to maintain a thriving arts sector.  There are further needs in Laois-Offaly, for example, how to reduce the numbers of those who die by suicide, how to sustain our manufacturing industries, how to manage our peat lands and forests, how to control our waterways to minimise flooding, how to increase our uptake in third level education and how to deal with unfinished estates.  I look forward to finding solutions to these problems in the coming years.This debate deals with one of the means of finding those solutions, namely, Government and Oireachtas reform.  Such reform is needed to strengthen our democracy and I would like to address one key area for reform — increasing women's participation in politics.  I have been an advocate for many years for the introduction of quotas to address the remarkable lack of women in the House.  We are at the bottom of the EU league table and 84th in the world ranking of women in parliament.  I have always believed that we cannot be a true democracy if we fail to take positive action to ensure women can influence debate and become part of our decision-making process.I very much welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that he intends to produce a Bill for Cabinet approval which will see political parties lose half their State funding if they do not put measures in place to run a minimum of 30% women candidates in the next general election, increasing to 40% after seven years.  It is a shame we have had to go the legislative route and that this has not happened voluntarily.  We, however, cannot avoid the fact that in 2007, 17% of total number of candidates running in the general election were women and that dropped to just 15% this year. In my constituency, I was the only female among  21 candidates.It is my sincere hope that not only will political parties achieve the 30% minimum of female candidates but will also develop strategies to ensure that female candidates will be selected to contest winnable seats.  A female candidate has as good a chance of getting elected as a male candidate if she is a good candidate contesting a winnable seat.  There are sincere people who are convinced that we do not need quotas.  However, I appeal to them to give quotas a chance to work.  It has been proven internationally that quotas work.  For example, following the introduction of gender quotas, Sweden now has 46.4% female parliamentarians and South Africa has 44.5% female parliamentarians.By now it is well established that the long working hours in political life are not family friendly.  Those in many other careers face a similar problem.  Perhaps we should lead by example in trying to achieve a work-life balance for both male and female Oireachtas Members.  As I look around I see many parents of young children who are trying to meet that challenge.  We will find solutions to the issue in examining the organisation of the Dáil and its workings.  I urge the Government to address this area in the context of the overall reform package in addition to the many positive initiatives already announced.If we address this issue, in addition to the introduction of gender quotas, it will enable us to ensure equal participation and equal distribution of power in decision making.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I challenge the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett that our participation in the IMF-EU plan is destroying democracy and has removed our sovereignty.  I note that he qualified the remark towards the end of his contribution.  The IMF and EU are not dictating to us what the rights of children should be.  They are not dictating to us how we should organise and run our schools and hospitals.  Neither are they dictating what our response should be to the killing of Osama bin Laden.  They are a variety of themes and issues that also form a vibrant and important part of our sovereignty.  There is no doubt that the economic element of sovereignty has been compromised, but there are still areas within which the Government can make decisions on what it wants to do.  On many other social aspects of our sovereignty — some of the areas to which Deputy Corcoran Kennedy referred at the start of her contribution — an elected Government still decides what those decisions are and those issues still matter very much to the people whom it serves.The nation is facing up to an array of challenges, some of the biggest problems the 21st century is capable of producing.  Despite that, we are working with a 19th century state in terms of the institutions we have.  This morning when we voted on the Order of Business I looked up at the Visitors Gallery.  A number of schoolchildren were visiting, all clad in uniform and looking with interest at what we were discussing and how we were voting.  Reform of the Dáil and other institutions of State is essential not only to the future prosperity of those schoolchildren but also to securing their interest in politics and gaining an understanding of how it works.  The overhaul of the institutions in the Dáil so that it matches up to contemporary life and its challenges is essential not only to our future prosperity but also to the interest people have in politics and to their continuing to give consent to being governed by us.I wish to make a number of practical suggestions on Dáil reform.  They come under two areas, first, how the institutions and the Dáil work and, second, how the Dáil and our work in it is perceived.  The point has been made continually about our involvement in the budgetary process.  Members of the Opposition will have good ideas about how the economy should be conducted and operated just as when we were in opposition we had Members with good ideas too.  The power and oversight is concentrated on the Government side of the House.  The lack of oversight and ability of Members of both Houses to contribute to the budgetary process and the oversight of it is an important element in contributing to the collapse we are trying to get out of now.  The Government has proposals on a fiscal council, the overhaul of the budgetary process and the role of committees that are hugely important to the future and must be implemented promptly during this term of office.The second point relates to the interaction of the Dáil with regulators.  One topical example of the problem relates to my experience as a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport in the previous term.  The taxi regulator was regularly invited before the committee.  Questions were often asked about the existence of a €30 million surplus in its bank account and the operation of its agency.  However, one television programme has got more prompt action from the regulator than hours of hearings in an Oireachtas committee with all the main executives in attendance.  That shows the weakness of the committee system in engaging with such people.  We must find a way of strengthening that system vis-à-vis the various regulators who affect all aspects of our lives.One aspect of the operation of the committee system gives me cause for concern.  I refer to the proposal for a referendum on the Abbeylara judgment.  That must be done.  I hope the people will consent to the referendum being passed.  One of the things it would do is confer upon the committee system and the Dáil structure powers that are quasi-judicial.  We must put great care into how those powers are exercised.  I am pleased to have had an opportunity to speak on the matter.  The implementation of the programme of Dáil reform is vital to the success of this term in the House.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	189	In the previous general election the public voted in large numbers for both Labour and Fine Gael who are now the Government parties.  They have promised us real reform.  I look forward to engaging with the process also with my colleagues in the Technical Group and all Opposition parties.Not much zeal is evident for reform at present.  It is difficult to get meaningful answers in the House or to have meaningful discussions and the approach to business is restrictive.  A number of practices are totally archaic.  One such practice is the raising of matters under section 32 requiring the suspension of Standing Orders to discuss an issue of national importance.  Whether there is one matter or three or four the Ceann Comhairle — whom I would not dare to criticise — rejects them all.  That has been the case with previous incumbents also.  It is tokenism at the very least to be allowed to raise an issue but one does not get a response.  That is a poor situation.  The same is true of Adjournment debates.  I pick these examples by way of illustration.  Again, they are pretty meaningless because the answer is prepared before one speaks on the matter.  One cannot have any debate or discourse on the matter.  One puts one's case in five minutes and the reply takes approximately five minutes also.  One is not allowed to ask for clarification.In his speech the Minister of State referred to radical reform of the system of government which would involve changes at constitutional and political level.  That is all fine and dandy but we will wait until we see it.  The number of committees is to be cut.  I compliment my Whip, Deputy Catherine Murphy, on the job she is doing.  It appears from the list of committees that the Opposition will only get a pittance.  If there was serious intent on behalf of the Government it would show goodwill and at least offer a number of committee Chairs, other important positions and more places to the Opposition because of the Government's significant majority.  It already has a huge majority in the Dáil, but will also have a majority on most of the committees.While there is good debate in committees, the outcome will always be the same while the Government has a majority.  It could, therefore, allow for a slimmer majority and allow more Opposition Deputies be involved in committees in which they have an interest.  I understand the number of committees is being reduced but the number of committee members has increased.  The Government should allow for that or we will not get real reform.The public voted for a significant change, but they are becoming disenchanted because they are not getting that change.  The previous speaker on the Government side mentioned the economic policies of the previous Government and the ideas that people on this side of the House had at the time, but those ideas were not sought.  There is no change this time.  Our ideas are not sought and we are not allowed to have a good debate on the issues.  Our Whip had a document this morning which mentioned a proposed change for Tuesday mornings, which would allow time for topical issues to be raised.  That is a necessary change.  The current system is archaic in that we cannot raise issues of national or significant local importance.Last night I submitted a motion for debate on the Adjournment today on the closure of a viable post office in Bansha, County Tipperary.  This is a huge issue because the post office there serves a huge hinterland.  Other rural post offices have closed in the past and many of their customers use the Bansha post office.  However, I have been told again today by the Office of the Ceann Comhairle that the Minister has no responsibility for An Post.  The current Government promised it would get rid of that type of response.  When it was in Opposition, we had a situation where the Minister with responsibility for health would not answer any question on health.  Any questions submitted got the response that the Minister had no responsibility for the HSE.  We were promised a change in that regard.

The party in Government, of which I was a part, set it up, before I was a Member.  However, Fine Gael promised the system would be changed, but we have just changed seats here.  Fine Gael has moved across the House and is carrying on the same old policy, with some cosmetic changes.  It stood down the board of the HSE, but that is all.  We could see that the other night when the Minister was being grilled on television on the inadequacies of the HSE.  There are glaring inadequacies and there is no accountability.  I accept it was my former colleague, now Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Micheál Martin, who set it up, but it was a cop-out.  The same is true for the National Roads Authority.  However, I did not realise that the policy whereby the Minister has no responsibility in matters applied to An Post.  Somebody must have responsibility.  Our democratically elected Government and Opposition must be accountable to the House.  We must return to that situation.It is because of the lack of accountability that people are withdrawing from the political process.  That is the reason too that meetings of We the Citizens are taking place around the country.  I attended a briefing with that group last week with some colleagues.  The people are disenchanted and that is the reason there was such a low turnout in the elections.  We had a quiet revolution here, unlike in other parts of the world.  People went into the election booths with their pencils and showed us what they wanted.  They showed in no uncertain terms they wanted to get rid of the previous Government and wanted a change.  They voted for change, but my concern is that they are not getting the change that was promised.  That is the problem with making promises.I have said that the Government parties need not have made any promises because they would have got in anyway.  However, promises on policy were made and we were reminded of some of those promises this morning.  I am not singling out this Government as previous Governments also made promises.  The party of which I was a member made many promises.  We now have a sophisticated electorate which can see the situation for what it is and realise when people are not being level and fair with them.  The same is true of what is happening here.  For example, on Europe Day the Dáil sat here on a Monday.  I did not attend that day.  I noted from the Minister's speech that it is proposed we sit more days, Mondays and Fridays and maybe Saturdays.  If we are to sit more often, we must be doing meaningful work.  There is no point in just being here as a token gesture.  I have been told by colleagues that the debate on Europe Day was a token debate and there was no real discussion.  There would be no point in coming up from Tipperary or whatever part of the country one represents just for that.  Any extra sitting days must involve real, responsible, lively and healthy debate and discourse.  That is what we need.  Therefore, I welcome the suggestion of talks about talks regarding the topical issues to be raised on Tuesday mornings from 12 noon.  That would be a good reform.We should have more ready access to legal advice.  We have immunity here to say what we feel like saying, but there are many issues with legal connotations and the advice should be available to deal with them.  The same should happen with regard to county councils.  When I was on the county council, the same legal adviser who advised management also advised the members.  That is a farce.  We need serious reform at that level also.  As it is, if members of the council want advice, they get the same advice as management gets.  The adviser cannot give different advice to both and members are told that if they want legal advice of their own, they must pay for it.  That is unfair and no county council can operate that way.I have many years' experience of working in the party system and was in the previous Dáil for three and a half years.  Therefore, I understand the Whip system.  It is draconian, as the new Government will find as time goes on and the Whip is tested.  I realise the system is necessary but there are flaws in it and changes are needed.  I enjoy the situation with regard to the Technical Group.  We debate and discuss issues, but we can vote any way we want.  There is freedom in that, which is a new experience for me.  It is good to have that liberty.  Deputies on the Government side may smile, but I am sure some of them will be without the Whip before very long.I wish the Government well, but remind it that I will be watching it.  The reforms must be real and meaningful.

Therefore, my contribution may be both negative and positive.  I can contribute positively by offering a fresh outlook, but the negative side of it is that I have less than three months' experience here.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue and welcome the healthy mix of contributions so far from both new and more experienced Deputies.I worked in a Deputy's office for a couple of years before becoming a Deputy, but since I was elected I have been struck by the huge amount of constituency work required of a Deputy.  I am not complaining about this and my staff and I are very happy to assist any constituents who approach us with issues important to them.  However, the work to be done curtails the amount of time a Deputy can spend on legislative and parliamentary work.  We need to create a more general awareness of the work required of a parliamentarian and that more appropriate to other levels of government.  It is not always possible politically to do that when approached by a constituent given that Deputies are in the privileged and honoured position to be able to assist the person.  It is, however, something that needs to be looked at generally.  There should be greater awareness of who does what and at what level.  This would help give parliamentarians more time to focus on their specific work.This is an issue that should be looked at.  The case could be made that it is a matter for electoral reform.  If we are to talk about Dáil reform, there must also be electoral reform to ensure that if reforms are put in place parliamentarians will have the time to engage more in Parliament.One of the greatest tools we have as Deputies is the facility to table parliamentary questions, which is a great opportunity for Deputies to obtain fairly comprehensive information most of the time from Ministers on most topics.  Unfortunately many of the parliamentary questions submitted relate to inquiries about individual entitlements and payments.  That has been assisted by the establishment of information lines through various Departments.  However, Deputies spend considerable time assisting with queries that really should be addressed by Departments and there should be no need for the constituent to approach the Deputy on such matters.  This area needs to be rectified so that parliamentary questions can be kept for the more appropriate areas, for which they were originally designed.Regarding oral questions, I believe that after priority questions are taken, answers should not be read in respect of questions submitted by Deputies who are not in the Chamber and the Minister should skip on to the next question submitted by a Deputy who is present.  The skipped questions could then be answered in writing, which would encourage greater attendance for Question Time and would reward those Deputies who show an interest in attending the Chamber.  It would also give a Deputy a chance to engage with a Minister on an issue of specific importance to that particular Deputy and would reduce the risk of losing out on questioning opportunity that applies with the current lottery system.In the three months since my election I have had no experience of working on committees and so am limited in what I can say on the issue.  However, a number of constituents have asked why committee chairmen receive payment on top of their salaries.  Many people to whom I have spoken feel that serving as chair of a committee should be a privilege and should not require additional payment.  This should be considered in the future.Regarding the Whip system, I am conscious of the person behind whom I am standing.  There is a strong argument for considering not applying the Whip on some issues that do not relate to financial issues or the election of Government.  This would lead to a stronger democracy and would be a more pure form of representation.  The system works well most of the time at local authority level and if it were introduced here, it might lead to a stronger Parliament.I hope we can have a discussion on electoral reform soon.  Many of the aspects of our work are impacted upon greatly by our electoral system and the impact of any Dáil reform would be greatly reduced unless it is coupled with electoral reform.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I thank Deputy Griffin for sharing his time.  Having only been a Member of this House for a few weeks, it may seem a bit cheeky to be talking about Dáil reform.  However, the procedures that operate in this House are in need of radical overhaul and I look forward to the new Government doing so.  There are three levels of reform that I would like to see introduced, namely, reform of the electoral system, reform of how the Oireachtas processes legislation and reform to make the Oireachtas and in particular this Chamber more relevant to matters of immediate national concern by allowing people to raise topical issues on a daily basis.  Under our current system, the Whip is very strong.  I have no problem with either the Government Whip or the Deputy Government Whip, but like the previous speaker I believe there are certain matters on which it should be up to the discretion of Members to make their own judgment in a freer fashion.The current system does not allow input by Government backbench or Opposition Deputies and inevitably Deputies find themselves fulfilling the role they are able to perform, which invariably involves dealing with a considerable amount of constituency work.  It is an important role of any public representative.  A Member of the Dáil is not just a legislator but also has a role as a Deputy and is here to represent the people in his or her constituency who are not here.  While that is an important function, it should not form the majority of the work of any Deputy.There is a strong need to reform how we elect Members of this House.  For a long time I have felt that the multi-seat constituency system is not conducive to electing the best people to Dáil Éireann.  As someone who has been both elected and defeated by that system, I feel it is in need of radical reform.  I do not know if the Government has made any specific proposals on that area.  I believe it has rightly proposed reducing the number of Deputies.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has spoken about giving renewed and additional powers to local government which might result in a more efficient delivery of local services with less need for constituents to contact national representatives on local issues, which I welcome.The media pays much attention to the amount of time the Dáil sits, which does not make much sense to me.  We could sit every day of the week and not perform properly or correctly.  The procedures to be adopted in the House could make things much more efficient and give a meaningful role to Deputies on all sides of the House rather than just considering it in the very rough measure of the number of days the Dáil sits.  I welcome the Government's commitment to reforming the committee system and to introducing a referendum to extend the powers of committees to compel people to come before them.During debates there is a need for more interaction between Members, including people giving way and having real questioning of Ministers and questioning of people's ideas.  I do not see that at present and when reform again comes to the top of the agenda I hope that the Whip will be able to implement that.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I act as the Whip for the Technical Group, which a bit of a misnomer because the Technical Group is just that and is a way of facilitating a very diverse group and not about whipping people into line or telling them how to vote, which would not be possible with the particular group considering the diversity it contains.  However, it does not mean we cannot work together.  The idea that diversity equals conflict is nonsense — if anything it gives strength.  I believe we will play a strong role in the Dáil in coming years.  My role is simply one of facilitation and co-ordination and perhaps we need to find a new term for it.Everybody here believes there is a need for Dáil reform and wider political reform.  While that means different things to different people, it was very strongly articulated on the doorsteps during the general election campaign.  We all have different ideas about what that means and how to improve the working of the Dáil.  I believe that localism can be a strength in its rightful place, but it is not in its rightful place when there is too much localism at national level.Without local government reform, there will be no Dáil reform.  We are not playing to our strengths.  The structure of our local government system does not allow for proper local engagement in respect of identity.  The system must not only be reformed, it must be reformed radically.  I refer to the abolition of many institutions, including county councils, for example, and having district and regional tiers that could act as a counterbalance to the Dáil in the way that the Seanad was supposed to act as such.  It could become part of that arrangement.I was a Member of the Dáil between 2005 and 2007.  I lost my seat in 2007 and, therefore, watched the crash from the outside.  I, as with all Members, was aware that people were in serious trouble worrying about how they would keep a roof over their heads.  From the outset, I was watching a Punch and Judy show taking place.  People were not getting a night's sleep, which was outrageous.  This is still the case today.  We must change the culture in the House to reflect the culture outside if we are to address the disconnect between civil society and the Oireachtas.This morning the Visitors Gallery was full with very well-behaved schoolchildren.  While I am not saying Members should behave all the time and be kept in a nice, neat little box, I believe the Order of Business is no example for people in the Visitors Gallery, including schoolchildren.  We must seriously do something about this.  Over recent weeks, I have been watching rule-breaking by Members and their efforts to make a contribution.  This is largely because there is no proper opportunity to make one.  Typically, a disproportionate number of males break the rules in the House.  In parliaments that have changed their gender balance, the culture has changed.  There is an advantage to this and we should regard it as positive.  I am quite supportive of the Government's initiative in this regard.I accept change will occur in the Dáil in an incremental way and that there will be no radical change in ten or 12 weeks.  We need a master plan, however, and to follow best practice in other countries.  This morning I was at a meeting with the Chief Whip and assistant Whip.  There is some engagement on a range of matters with a view to making a start.  In his speech the Chief Whip referred to the new Oireachtas committee which will deal with radical reform.  We want to see radical reform and not tinkering at the edges.  I am concerned that what will be delivered in the first round of Dáil reform will be all that is delivered.  We need a master plan to know what the system will be like at the end of the process so that we can genuinely hold the Executive to account.The Government side of the House is very big and I sometimes believe it is more a case of the Government holding the Opposition to account than the Government backbenchers and Opposition holding the Government to account.  There is more criticism of this side of the House than there is engagement regarding the constitutional obligation of both Government and Opposition backbenchers to hold the Executive to account.I agree with those Members who referred to the misuse of the guillotine.  We must avoid this as much as possible.  It should be used only in exceptional circumstances because using it represents bad practice.  It does not allow for the scrutiny required and it comes back to haunt in most cases.  There are certainly unintended consequences.The legislation pertaining to the holding of State bodies to account, including the Environmental Protection Agency, HSE and National Roads Authority, has a very significant flaw.  I have not seen exactly how change will occur in this regard and would like to hear realistic proposals.  Too many functions have been outsourced that should be under the control of the Government.Members should be in the Chamber to hear answers to their oral questions.  The vast majority of Technical Group Members believe this should be the case.  Many parliamentary questions for written response pertain to things that do not work.  It should be a matter of fixing these problems so citizens will not have to go to a Member of the Oireachtas to resolve issues they should be able to resolve themselves.I very much welcome the proposal on topical debates.  This will make a difference and it will be interesting to see what happens in this regard from the autumn.  We do not favour the imposition of limits on the Order of Business because, if there are votes, the allocated time could be very limited.  This point has been made at meetings with the Chief Whip.Given the considerable size of the Government side, there should be parity of representation by Government and Opposition Members on committees, particularly committees such as the Committee of Public Accounts.  If an Opposition Member is Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and if the committee's function is to hold the Government to account, there should be equal representation, although I understand matters tend not be decided by way of vote.  Equal representation would act as a safeguard.  The proposed membership of committees does not suggest this will occur.  That is a serious mistake.  I ask the Government to take another look at this.  The imbalance in representation is a flaw to which we should not agree.

He, a fresher Deputy only a wet day in the House, made derogatory personal remarks about me, which has never happened to me in the 24 years I have served here.  It is probably one of the many flashes in the pan I have seen in my time here.  As a fresher or rookie, Deputy Donnelly would be expected to have some respect for other Members of the House and, if not for them, at least for the people who sent us here.  Perhaps he will reflect on that.I join the Chief Whip, Deputy Paul Kehoe, in welcoming the ongoing consultative process.  It is not just about the mechanics of the way the Dáil operates on a day to day basis but much wider reform of the institutions and procedures for making the decisions required, and this debate is part of that process.This is a legislative assembly and not a debating society.  Its time is divided into periods where the Government is kept to account by means of questions to Ministers and to the Taoiseach, and also by Adjournment debates and three hours per week of Private Members' time.  The balance of the time is Government time during which legislation is debated and decided upon.  How to make better use of that time to both legislate and keep the Executive to account is a task we are undertaking.  I believe there is a large measure of goodwill on all sides of the House to achieve that objective.  The Government reform programme outlined last night by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is the main stimulus for the project we are undertaking.I will briefly touch again on an issue I raised last night, that is, the power of quangos and what we have done with the power of this House in regard to quangos.  There is a specific undertaking in the programme for Government that this will be dealt with in the form of making the quangos responsible to this House through the Ministers under whose remit they come.  In other words, Members will be able to ask questions of Ministers who have quangos under their remit and get replies.  Currently, that is not the position.A huge tranche of power has been transferred out of this House and out of the power of the people to faceless people who are not accountable to the people in any real sense.  That has reduced and diluted democracy when the real power in democracy is the power to ask a question and get an answer.  That has been removed from us in a very large area where previously we could ask questions but we can no longer do so because they are not allowed.  I welcome the fact that there is some move to bring that power back into the Chamber.On the ordinary workday in the Dáil, real changes are necessary to keep the Executive to account and enable us to legislate effectively.  The taking of new topical issues early in the day, referred to previously, with supplementary questions is a major change from the old system of Adjournment debates where a Minister of State would come in with a sheaf of replies prepared by civil servants that Ministers never saw and read them out to the House.  That is a travesty of parliamentary procedure.There is no doubt that the Order of Business is a shambles.  It is a shambles because there is no proper procedure for ordinary Members of the House to raise current issues and they then try to find a means through the Order of Business to attach it to legislation to get it mentioned.  That was an ineffective way of doing it but it was out of order.  We must find a means by which Members can raise current issues that arise on the day, and not just by way of pre-notice, and get some form of responsible reply from Government.  That is important.  This issue has been raised already by a number of Deputies.Question Time is dominated by the spokespersons for the groups.  That is not true of the Technical Group but of the Opposition parties.  It is dominated by them and abused by them in so far as they put in the maximum number of questions which are then all taken in the name of the spokesperson.  That is not a satisfactory system for parliamentary questions.  Deputy Wallace mentioned that in the debate last night and I strongly support him in that regard.We should have a system — all Deputies have said this — whereby if a parliamentary question is put down in one's name and one is not in the House when that question is reached, it moves on to the next question.  The situation should not arise where one Member of the House can take 15, 20 or 30 questions and beat the lottery by doing so in that he or she puts down the maximum number of questions and they are sure to come out of the lottery.Raising matters under Standing Order 32, which we see abused as well, is meant only for national crises but again Members are using it because there is no system available to them to raise current issues.  That should be changed.  There should be a requirement for Standing Order 32 motions to have at least five Members signing them before they are raised.On the question Deputy Catherine Murphy raised about a master plan, those of us on this side of the House have no excess amount of intelligence or knowledge about how to do that.  If she can come up with a good master plan I ask her to produce it as quickly as she can and we will all examine it.  We might be able to implement bits of it and put it together as a jigsaw but we have no special amount of expertise to do that no more than the Members opposite.  Perhaps we can all work together on that.  The process in which we are involved allows us to do that.I refer to local government reform which is a prominent part of the Government reform programme.  Local government in Ireland is a misnomer.  We do not have local government, we have local administration by a system of highly paid managers and directors of service.  Managers are paid about the same salary as a Minister and the programme managers are paid more than Deputies.In Kildare we have a manager and eight programme managers.  We have engineers coming out of our ears, so to speak.  We have engineers for everything in Kildare and when they want to do something they hire consultants to tell them what to do.  One group of engineers is involved in monitoring the consultants when they are doing their work and another group is involved in interpreting the consultants' work.

I would like to see a major change in that regard.  Such major change is provided for in the programme for Government.The management system at local government has been a failure and the power will be transferred from the manager to the people we elect.  The people we elect are the people who should have power.  If they need expert advice in the form of engineers they can hire that but the people who have the power to make the decisions should be the people who are elected.In my constituency it is much easier to get an interview with the Taoiseach than with the director of services or planning.  It is not possible to get a meeting with senior officials on the council.  It is a disgrace that they have been handed that amount of power without any type of check on them whatsoever.It is about time that we revert to real democracy at local level and give power back to the people through the representatives they elect.  I was taken with Deputy Catherine Murphy's idea of district and regional councils.  It is worthy of examination.  We must take the power at that level away from nameless, inaccessible, unelected power brokers from the county manager down.

What strikes me most is a genuine desire on all sides of the House for change, both the recognition that the system fundamentally does not work and a real desire to see it change.  As I stated yesterday, I welcome many of the Government's proposals and agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Stagg on the extraordinary situation in local government whereby the elected officials seem to be blocked out of a great deal of substantive decision making.I wish to make some observations.  In my previous role before coming to this House I was involved a great deal in transformational change, and particularly in cultural change.  Much of the debate in the past two days has been to do with changing the rules.  There has been a great deal of agreement on the outcomes and the changes we want to see brought about.From my own experience in cultural change and looking at evidence around the world, as I said previously, most major change programmes fail.  One of the reasons they fail is because people agree on the outcomes and some of the working practices or behaviours that need to change, but often that is where change programmes tend to stop.  They do not get down to the next level which drives the practices and the behaviours, namely, the mindsets.I encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Keogh, to go beyond thinking about the best changes in working practices and try to consider the mindsets.I would like to give an example of this in respect of the free vote.  Let us say the House decides we would like to address the concentration of power in the Executive by allowing a limited number of free votes.  Several Deputies on the Government side have said they would love to have the Whip removed on occasions.  Let us say the Government parties agree and allow free votes for the next three votes.  At this stage it is important to address the mindsets.  The current mindset for a Member on the Government side who does not vote along Government lines is that the Chief Whip will call on that Member's office and he or she might be in a lot of trouble.  If a free vote is allowed from time to time but that is still the mindset, then nothing will change because everyone will still vote according to the Whip.  If we could change the mindset so a Government backbencher felt he or she was expected also to hold the Cabinet to account and to bring in new ideas, and if we allow the free vote, then we will begin to get a shift in the outcomes.  I encourage the Minister of State to think about that.  I would be delighted to sit down and talk about various places where I have seen this work.Part of addressing the change in culture is in respect of role models.  One theory of change states that in order for me to change my behaviour, four things need to be true.  I need to agree with the change being asked of me.  I need to be incentivised to make that change.  I need to be capable of making that change.  I need to see significant others being role models for that change.  The research shows that role modelling is more important than the other three elements combined.  I encourage the Minister of State and his colleagues to think about how important their actions are in driving real cultural change in the Oireachtas.  An example already mentioned today is in respect of the committees.  The number and make up of the committees was essentially provided as a fait accompli.  If that kind of activity happens, in spite of all the talk about working practices, it is very hard to change culture and get genuine reform.During the week, the Taoiseach was asked repeatedly about the analysis on the impact of the pension levy.  He refused to answer the question several times.  He was then asked if he could at least tell the House whether he received any analysis.  Again he refused to answer the question.  He may have good reasons for doing that, but in terms of role modelling, it tells us that the Government will not really hold itself accountable and answer what seem to be reasonable questions.There is much to welcome.  Everybody seems to agree on committee effectiveness.  It looks like there will be a referendum on introducing compulsory powers for committees.  We will get committee input into legislation at an earlier stage.  I would love the Minister of State to consider how early that happens.  Recommendations I have seen suggest that committees should have input before the legislation is drafted so they can explain the objectives and the spirit of the legislation to the people who are developing the detailed policy.  I would love to see this recommendation carried out.The introduction of topical issues is fantastic.  There has been some acceptance around the House that it would be advantageous to introduce ministerial questions and answers on any legislation that a given Minister is introducing, rather than just the rota of the day.We need to have regulatory impact analyses.  The Government would bring it in and Members of the Oireachtas would be able to submit comments and counter proposals.  Policy makers and the Cabinet would then come back having addressed each of the proposals.  It is a very effective mechanism to improve policy and to create real accountability.  I would also like to see a legal advisory capacity.  It seems to be one of the areas in which there is a bit of a blind spot for those of us outside the Cabinet, which of course has the Attorney General.  I believe former Deputy Gay Mitchell made a recommendation on Oireachtas reform that the Opposition would have access to a high quality legal advisory capacity.  For example, I would love to sit down with some experienced lawyers and talk through the bondholder payments and ask whether this transfer of money from private Irish individuals to foreign private investors is legal.These are my suggestions.  I would be happy to sit down with the Minister of State or anybody else to talk through the mindsets, the cultural change and the things that underpin real sustainable change.  I wish the Minister of State well and I absolutely believe in his desire to make this a much better functioning House.

We all recognise that Dáil Éireann is a reflection of Irish society and every Member elected to this House is charged with electoral responsibilities to reflect the views of those we represent, but also to make decisions in the interests of the greater good of this country.  As a new Deputy, one of my biggest challenges is to find adequate time for speaking slots, in spite of the co-operation of the Chief Whip.  There is difficulty in trying to get adequate slots on the various debates.  Through shared time and other mechanisms, we will have to try to improve this so that every Deputy, from all parties and none, will have the opportunity to express his or her views.  Most new Deputies are already finding new ways to maximise their impact in the Dáil.  There are other fora and platforms that will assist in this process.The most important thing is that Dáil Éireann is accountable to the people it represents.  It must also be very transparent in its workings.  It is essential that democratically elected parliamentarians of whatever hue are taken seriously by the Government and by the Civil Service, so that all views are taken on board.  We heard during the last Dáil that we would not have the Punch and Judy show anymore, but I can recall at the time that the only show in town was about resolving the banking crisis.  If there was proper engagement and if the Government of the day listened to the Opposition then we would not be in the economic mess we are in today.Ministers and elected parliamentarians need to take power back from the various executives that have been set up over the last few years.  Many powers of the elected Members have been ceded to the various executives.  There was recent controversy with the HSE's fair deal, where taxpayers' money allocated in a vote under one heading was spent in other areas.  That creates a problem when the Minister for Health tries to explain how the HSE has mishandled the issue, even though authority has been ceded to the HSE by a previous Minister and Government.  I fully support the current Minister's effort to reconnect the Department of Health with the HSE across many areas.  In the longer term, when time and re-organisation permits, I will support his effort to restructure the HSE.  The Minister for Health should be the accountable person for how public funds are spent in health areas.Another example is the National Roads Authority.  It has done magnificent work over recent years and we can see that in the motorways, highways and byways.  If I table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, as I have done in the past, for example, about the lack of services on the motorway between Waterford and Dublin, the Minister is excluded from responding to my query which is referred to the NRA.  We need to bring the executive authorities of these bodies back to Dáil Éireann and make them properly accountable to the Minister.I agree with much of what Deputy Stagg said about the need for reform not only in Dáil Éireann but also in the political system generally.  We were talking about proposals to abolish the Seanad.  In New Zealand, two new legislative stages were introduced to substitute for the loss of the second House.  We need to consider all those options in order that any legislation that passes through the Chamber is subjected to proper and full scrutiny.We need to be careful, when we are reforming, that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  We must not undermine democratic accountability.  In fact, we need to enhance it.  The committee system is an excellent way of doing this.  I make the point to the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, that as soon as the committees are established and working, the sooner we can have real engagement in developing policy based on proposals from all parties, the better it will be for Government and society.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I am pleased to support the plans in the programme for Government for Dáil reform, particularly the concept of refocusing power on the Dáil itself. The Executive has held the balance of power for far too long, resulting in a lack of transparency and accountability in our legislative work. However, the type of reform I am interested in is seeing more women in the Dáil Chamber. The current figures are damning. There are only 25 women elected in the current Dáil. Women represent half the population yet make up only 15% of this Parliament. Female representation in Dáil Éireann has never before exceeded14%. Unsurprisingly, Ireland is performing very badly in world terms.  Based on the 30th Dáil, Ireland ranked joint 85th in the world, with Cameroon, in terms of female representation in Parliament. Believe it or not, Rwanda, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan ranked ahead of us, countries about which we have concerns in terms of women's rights.There are many complicated reasons for the low numbers of women in politics.  It is worth noting, however, that it is not due to a general failure on the part of women candidates to be elected.  The real problem is persuading women to become election candidates in the first place.  Only 15% of the candidates in the recent general election were women, an increase of 2% on the last election in 2007.  The debate on whether this is the result of a reluctance on the part of women to get involved in politics or a reluctance on the part of political parties to put them forward for election is ongoing.  The last Oireachtas subcommittee on women's participation in politics conducted extensive research into the barriers to female participation, and named as the main obstacles the five Cs — child care, cash, culture, confidence and the candidate selection process.Claiming Our Future, an Irish organisation devoted to equality issues, found that of the €15 million in State funding to political parties, only 3% is devoted to promoting women's participation in politics.  It seems the only way to encourage parties to get serious about this issue is to hit them where it hurts — in their pockets.  I am delighted, therefore, at the recent proposals to halve State funding to political parties if they do not meet the new requirement to ensure that at least 30% of their candidates in the next general election are women.I recognise that gender quotas are not the complete solution to this problem as they cannot work in isolation.  Reform of the political culture in this country is just as important.  The Minister's proposal is a good start, but it deals only with the candidate selection process.  What are we doing to change the culture?  We must implement real cultural change in politics and in the Dáil.  Women find the arguing and shouting of male politicians very off-putting.  Many of my constituents made this point very strongly when I was canvassing in the Dún Laoghaire constituency.  Women are interested in getting the job done, not talking or shouting about the problem.  There is also the issue of child care.  There is no doubt that women are still the main carers of children in Irish society.  The working hours of the Irish Parliament are not family-friendly, and I call for this to be considered when the Dáil reform Bill goes through the Houses.The theme of the recent election was change.  Many people were seeking a change in terms of which party holds the purse strings and makes the economic decisions.  However, we also need radical change in our political institutions and culture.  Let us hope this election has marked a real change in the prospects for women in Irish politics.

Tá roinnt leasaithe go bhfuil mé ina bhfábhar agus cuid eile go bhfuil mé go mór ina n-aghaidh.  Tá cuid eile gur mhaith liom tuilleadh macnamh a dhéanamh orthu.Tá dearcadh coitianta thart gurb é an t-aon rud atá tábhachtach ná go gcuirfimís leis an méid ama a shuíonn an Dáil.  Feicim go leor contúirtí ag baint leis seo.  Mar shampla, iad siúd atá díograiseach faoi obair na Dála, fanfaidh siad anseo.  Ag an am gcéanna, beidh deis ag Teachtaí Dála imeacht abhaile — daoine nach bhfuil ceangailte do pháirtí ar bith nó fiú taobh istigh des na páirtithe — agus a bheith ag déanamh obair dháilcheantair an fhaid is atá daoine díograiseacha ag plé le hobair na Dála agus le hobair na gcoistí.  Tá mé cinnte go dtuigeann an t-Aire Stáit an contúirt a bhaineann leis sin agus an brú a chuirfeadh sé orthu siúd atá díograiseach faoina gcuid oibre.Tá rud eile atá thar a bheith aisteach faoin moladh seo: suí Dé hAoine agus breis uaireanta i rith na seachtaine, agus níos lú ama le caitheamh sa dháilcheantar nó sa bhaile.  Ceann des na torthaí a bheidh leis sin ná go mbeidh sé níos deacra agus níos deacra dos na daoine atá i bhfad ó bhaile feidhmiú sa Dáil.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta a bhí ag caint romham — thaitneodh sé nó nach dtaitneodh sé liom — titeann go leor de chúram leanaí ar mhná.  Smaoiníonn daoine i gcónaí ar na naíonáin, ach nuair a thagann leanaí do aois a ceathair nó a cúig agus nuair a thosaíonn siad ar an scoil, ní féidir an páiste a thabhairt go Baile Átha Cliath.  Más rud é go bhfuil Teachtaí Dála thuas i mBaile Átha Cliath Dé Máirt, Dé Céadaoin, Déardaoin agus Dé hAoine, chiallódh sé go mbeadh ar dhaoine an baile a fhágail, agus gasúir óga sa bhaile, agus ceithre lá a chaitheamh thuas anseo.  Tá go leor daoine nach mbeadh sásta an íobairt sin a dhéanamh, agus tuigim dóibh.  Fiú ar mo thaobh féin, bhí mé i gcónaí sásta nár éirigh liom fáil tofa do cheachtar de dhá Theach an Oireachtais go dtí go raibh na gasúir beagáinín fásta.  Dá mba rud é go raibh mé thuas anseo ceithre lá den tseachtain ag an am sin, chaillfinn amach go leor ar shaol óg na ngasúr.Caithfimid an-mhachnamh a dhéanamh air seo.  Go minic, nuair a bhíonn plé air seo bíonn daoine i mBaile Átha Cliath ag caint ar uaireanta níos giorra.  Is é ba mhaith le muintir Bhaile Átha Cliath, agus tuigim dóibh mar is as Baile Átha Cliath mé, go dtosódh an Dáil ag a naoi agus go gcríochnódh sé ag a cúig.  B'fhearr le muintir na tuaithe go mbeadh an tseachtain níos giorra agus na laethanta níos faide mar is í an fhadhb atá acu siúd go bhfuil siad as baile an t-am ar fad a mbíonn an Dáil ag suí.  Teastaíonn tuillleadh plé ar an gceist seo.Tagaim go hiomlán leis an smaoineamh go mbeadh níos lú coistí ann.  Bhí mé ag rá le blianta fada go raibh i bhfad an iomarca coistí.  Tacaím leis an moladh sin.  Tá súil agam go bhfeidhmeoidh na coistí níos fearr.  Nuair a bhínn istigh ag coistí mar Aire is minic a chonaic mé an rud a bhíodh ag tarlú.  Thosaíodh an coiste le deichniúr i láthair agus faoi cheann tamaillín bhig ní bhíodh fágtha ach urlabhraithe na bpáirtithe, triúr nó ceathrar ar a mhéid.  Ní shin an chaoi cheart le coiste a oibriú.  Má tá coiste ann, ba cheart go mbeadh tinreamh iomlán ann ó thús go deireadh.  Mar a dúirt mé arú aréir ag caint sa Dáil, tá an iomarca buntáiste sa Dáil seo dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh an soundbite.  Níl dóthain bhuntáiste ann dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh an obair a dhéanamh.Maidir leis an leasú bunreachtúil atá molta i gcás Abbeylara, caithfimid bheith cúramach.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh deis fiosrúcháin cheart a dhéanamh, níl aon fhadhb agam leis sin, ach má táimid ag cur milleáin ar dhaoine ainmnithe, caithfimid smaoineamh gur polaiteoirí sinn agus go bhfuil dearcaidh pholaitiúla léirithe againn taobh amuigh den Teach agus gur idir dhá rud atá an fhírinne sa scéal seo agus go bhfuil ceart ag daoine bheith cinnte nach ndéanfar rud a chur ina leith faoi phribhléid an Tí seo gan chosaint cheart a thógáil san áireamh gur polaiteoirí sinn agus gurb é ár ngnóthaí dearcadh polaitiúil a thabhairt isteach sa Teach seo.B'iomaí rud, áfach, gur cheart go mbeimis in ann a dhéanamh.  Bhí mise ag moladh le gairid go ndéanaimid fiosrúchán iomlán ar na téarmaí atá ann maidir le dul ag tóraíocht ola amach ón gcósta.  Caithfimid an cheist seo a scrúdú ach d'fhéadfaimis dul thar fóir ar an dtaobh eile.Tá mé an-tógtha leis na smaointe atá ann maidir leis na ceisteanna parlaiminte ach ba mhaith liom dul níos faide fiú.  Aontaím go hiomlán mar iar-Aire go raibh sé craiceáilte 100 ceist a bheith thíos agus gan sinn ag freagairt ach 15 acu agus am na Státseirbhíse curtha i leataobh ag freagairt na gceisteanna sin ar fad.  Tá mionrud anseo is ansiúd gur cheart a leasú ach tacaím leis an chur chuige ginearálta.  Tá mé i bhfabhar go gcaithfí breis ama le ceisteanna ach ba cheart ceisteanna a chur i bhfad níos minice ná mar a dhéantar sa Pharlaimint seo.  Ní thuigim cén fáth go gcaithfimid fanacht cúig seachtaine mar go minic bíonn scéalta briste imithe fuar sula n-éiríonn linn iad a phlé anseo agus pléitear ag na meáin iad i bhfad sula bpléitear anseo iad.  Bhí mé an-tugtha le córas a chonaic mé ag feidhmiú i bParlaimint Cheanada.  Nuair a bhí tráth na gceist ann bhí sraith Airí ar fáil, mar atá anseo ag Ceisteanna na gCeannairí, cúpla lá sa tseachtain agus ba cheart dúinn breathnú air sin.Tagaim go hiomlán leis an rud a dúradh maidir le Madame Guillotine a bhíodh in úsáid anseo.  Rinne mé iarracht mar Aire gan dul i muinín an ghilitín nuair a bhí mé in ann agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an Rialtas nua é a sheachaint, go mór mór ar Chéim an Choiste.  Le bheith fírinneach, tá an-iomarca ama caite ar an Dara Chéim de Bhillí agus ní chaitear a dhótháin ama ar Chéim an Choiste nó ar Chéim na Tuarascála de Bhillí nuair a bhíonn brú ama ann.  Sin iad an dá chéim is tábhachtaí de Bhille mar is ansin a dhéantar cinneadh ar na focail a dhéanfaidh breitheamh breithiúnas orthu.Maidir leis na moltaí faoin Athló, arís tá súil agam go dtógfar iad ag am tráthúil den lá.  Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeidh deis freagraí a fháil go gasta ar rudaí.  Tugaim faoi deara le gairid, áfach, go bhfuil Airí ag déanamh fógraí móra faoin rud atá le tarlú agus áirím anseo é ar Riar na hOibre agus an Ceann Comhairle ag tabhairt amach dom go bhfuil mé ag cur an iomarca ceisteanna.  Is é an bhuncheist atá agam ná an bhféadfaimis na mórcheisteanna go mbeimis ar fad á bplé sna meáin a phlé sa Teach seo ag an am atá siad ag tarlú.  Níl aon mhaith a rá go bpléifimid iad faoi cheann ceithre nó cuig seachtaine mar faoin am sin bíonn an scéal imithe agus na cinntí déanta.  Ba cheart breathnú ar an gceist sin agus féachaint an bhfuil aon bhealach gur féidir a chinntí go bléifear na ceisteanna anseo.Admhaím go raibh Rialtais ann, agus Rialtais ina raibh mise, ró-chosantach faoin gceist seo.  Go pearsanta, áfach, bhí mé i gcónaí ag tairscint rudaí mar seo a phlé mar chreid mé sa rud a bhí mé ag déanamh agus níor shíl mé go raibh cúis ar bith nach dtiocfainn isteach chun scéal a mhíniú mar bheadh sé i bhfad ní ba éasca é a mhíniú in áit structúrtha mar seo ná a bheith ag iarraidh plé in áit nach raibh struchtúr leis an díospóireacht agus nach raibh tuiscint ag daoine ar na srianta atá le hAirí mar atá go ginearálta ag polaiteoirí.  Ba cheart go mbeadh deis ceisteanna a thagann aníos ó sheachtain go seachtain a phlé gach seachtain sa Dáil agus níor cheart go mbeadh sin teoranta do Private Members' Business.Tá caint anseo ar líon na dTeachtaí Dála a laghdú.  Tá iontas an tsaoil orm go bhfuil Teachta Dála agus Taoiseach as Maigh Eo ag moladh go laghdófar líon na dTeachtaí Dála.  Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach féin go dtogfadh sé dhá uair an chloig go leith tiomáint ó cheann amháin dá dháilcheantar go dtí an ceann eile.  Má dhéantar na dáilcheantair níos mó beidh Sligeach agus Maigh Eo le chéile agus ní bheidh aon bhealach ag na Teachtaí Dála freastal ar an méid sin daoine.  Cé a chaillfidh amach?  Na daoine ar an imeall, na daoine atá i bhfad ón bhaile.  Tá codanna de dháilcheantair ann cheana féin nach dtéann TD ann mar níl an daonra sách tiúbh ná sách mór.  Má tá an Rialtas ag dul an bhealaigh seo, caithfidh sé a chinntiú agus a leagan síos gur toghcheantair le trí shuíochán a bheidh sna dáilcheantair ar fad.  Níl aon chiall le toghcheantair le cúig shuíochán tuaithe agus ceantair mhóra millteanacha iad, agus ag ceapadh go mbeidh sin ar leas an phobail.  Rud amháin a bhí go maith sa pholaitíocht in Éirinn ná go raibh deis ag an bpobal fáil ar Theachtaí Dála.  Má dhéantar na hathruithe seo, ní bheidh fáil sna ceantair i bhfad ón bhaile ar na Teachtaí Dála agus beidh éagóir á dhéanamh ar chuid den phobal is laige agus is leochailí dá bhfuil ann.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I wish to respond to points I heard made in the debate earlier.  Deputies John Paul Phelan and Brendan Griffin spoke about the need to couple Dáil reform with reform of the electoral system and I fundamentally disagree with this.  The point needs to be repeated again and again that any electoral system other than PR-STV in multi-seat constituencies would give the voter in Ireland less say.  Single seat constituencies would favour the larger parties and would be a case of winner takes all; it is not much better a system than first past the post.  Smaller parties and those who vote for them would find it more difficult to elect people to the Dáil.  A list system would impose on the Dáil exactly that for which we criticise the Seanad, namely, unelected people appointed by party leaders with no requirement to go before the people in the ballot.  In our system, individual people and not only political parties are held accountable by the voter, and we would be mad to move away from this.It is misguided to think our problems were caused by our electoral system.  This suggests that voters should not be trusted to vote for their representatives.  Democracy is not perfect, as has been stated, but it is better than any other system.  The other side of this is that it is a wonderful system, and the voters spoke in the most recent election.  There is an idea that people going to Deputies' clinics caused our problems with the banks.  They were not caused by a person on social welfare going to a Deputy's constituency clinic, and they are not the people who should be taken out of the equation.  They were caused by the completely unaccountable bankers going to a Minister in the middle of the night seeking a bank guarantee, and the completely unregulated lobbyists seeking tax breaks for developers.  This is where the problem lies and where reform is needed.People speak about mixed electoral systems.  There are problems in countries with a two tier system of members of Parliament because the public think the constituency-elected members are the real ones.  This was found in research carried out in Wales, where a few years ago a commission recommended moving to PR-STV, the system which we have.  Other countries have civic campaigns to introduce PR-STV in multi-seat constituencies because it is the most democratic and proportionate of electoral systems in practice in the world today.  I absolutely defend PR-STV and I am proud to have been elected in this way.  It is a difficult way to get elected but it gives the voter the ultimate say on who sits in the Dáil.I fundamentally disagree with gender quotas.  Under our Constitution, one cannot prevent people from putting forward their names for election on the basis of gender.  No woman has ever been told she cannot put forward her name for election.  However, in practice, a gender quota would mean that men would be told that they cannot put forward their names and that people cannot vote for them because they are men.  This is not the way to deal with the issue of women not participating in politics.As has been said, there is no difficulty about women getting elected.  Women are winning selection conventions so that is not the problem.  There is a need for more women to become active in political parties and to want to run for election.  If we start to make top-down decisions in regard to the selection of candidates through the imposition of gender quotas, we should be in no doubt that party leaderships will ensure they impose the gender quota against those they do not want and in favour of those they want.  Top-down decisions in regard to the selection of candidates take away the right of people to decide whether they want to go forward for selection and of members to pick their candidates.  It is fundamentally undemocratic.  If we really want more women in politics, we must make our parties more democratic and stop the tendency to move away from party members making decisions about matters such as this.  I fundamentally oppose gender quotas.There are different opinions on gender quotas.  Many women inside and outside political parties are against gender quotas while some men are for them.  That is freedom of speech.  If we want more women in politics, we want women who will express their opinions and who are entitled to say what they think in debates such as this.  Often the likes of the National Women's Council basically tarnish women just because they express a different view to it on this issue and make derogatory comments about us, which is unacceptable.The real issue in terms of Dáil reform is how it operates.  The former Taoiseach, John Bruton, put it best.  We need to shift the balance back to the Government backbencher and the Opposition Deputy.  Any moves we make must do that.  There is much to be desired in terms of how parliamentary questions are answered.We also need to deal with the empty Chamber syndrome.  The Whips tell us to be here when Leaders' Questions or Taoiseach's questions are being taken but they should tell us to be here to listen to each other on this important issue and to have a proper debate where one listens to what someone says and then either agrees or disagrees.  That is proper debate and it is an issue which needs to be addressed.
#AnneFerris	unknown-#AnneFerris-party	unknown-#AnneFerris-dob	unknown-#AnneFerris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I welcome the opportunity to debate an issue of fundamental importance, namely, reform of the Dáil.  It is a subject on which much has been spoken but little action has been taken.  This new coalition Government that has already accomplished so much in such a short period of time has its eyes set on reform.  However, it is reform with more depth and substance to it than that offered by the current Opposition when in government.It is also reform that will ensure people's voices are heard.  This will be achieved through a range of measures, including setting up a constitutional convention which will, for the first time, have meaningful input from a range of stakeholders in how they view a 21st century constitution.  The current framework is that of a 1930s anachronism reflecting an ethos and a religious tradition that cannot be said to be representative of the people today.  The substantive issues at which it will look, include amending the demeaning clauses on women, provision for same-sex marriage and the removal of blasphemy from the Constitution.  It will also look at our electoral system to see whether it is fit for purpose and whether there should be a reduction in voting age.  I look forward to the implementation of this convention and I hope an equal balance of men and women will be appointed.  This is only fair as a reflection not, unfortunately, of the current Oireachtas but of a society where that 50:50 gender split exists.Further commitments include reform of the parliamentary questions system.  It is important the parliamentary questions system is extended to bodies under statute or funded by the State, as is proposed in the programme for Government.  I, for one, am fed up tabling parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health and receiving replies stating, "this is a matter for the HSE".  Thereafter, one might — only might — get a reply from it.There are plans for the HSE to be reformed and responsibility returned directly to the Minister but it is still extremely frustrating.  For instance, I am waiting for a reply to an important query regarding the distribution of diabetes paediatric services.  This is after asking a parliamentary question and sending a letter to the HSE.  Those concerned, constituents of mine in County Wicklow, cannot afford to wait and this is an untenable situation.There is another matter on which I would like to touch briefly as it should go hand in hand with Dáil reform, namely, reform of the Judiciary.  For too long the Judiciary has managed to hold itself aloft from talk of meaningful reform.  The Judicial Council Bill, for instance, originally mooted over a decade ago has come to naught.  I, for one, am very concerned by this.  The history of judicial misconduct is not, fortunately, one of widespread corruption or gross incompetence.  However, when misconduct has occurred and come to light, the consequences have been extremely serious.  Most of us will remember the Brian Curtin affair and the appalling way that particular case was handled.  He was not the first judge accused of gross misconduct and a GUBU-like list could be created detailing a somewhat desperate history.Further meaningful reform must be addressed in this area and not least in the appointment of judges.  As it stands, judicial nominees generally come from a wide and varied background — that of the wealthy middle-aged white man schooled in Clongowes Wood College all the way to the wealthy middle-aged white man schooled in Blackrock College.  On 22 July of this year, a vacancy will arise at the end of a seven-year term for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  I suggest a woman could be considered for this post not simply because of the significance of having the first female Chief Justice but because there are so many candidates both inside and outside the Judiciary with vast experience they could bring to this position.The Labour Party has always been a strong supporter of women's rights and the first female Attorney General was appointed by this Government.  There is, therefore, no reason this Government cannot consider this appointment to the highest court in the land.  After all, as it stands, there are but two women out of nine currently serving in the court, which is another disappointing reflection of Irish society.I hope the separation of powers will be rebalanced by the end of this term of Government.  The eyes of the Dáil have turned on the Executive for a rebalancing through its reform of this institution but those eyes must also look to the Judiciary to see that justice, in the wider sense, is truly done.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I wish to comment on what Deputies Tuffy and Anne Ferris said.  The HSE and the National Roads Authority have grown into monsters and are out of control.  The Government cannot tell them what to do anymore; they are not answerable.  It would be great if this Government brought power back to the House.  I agree with what Deputy Stagg said about quangos, as I did last night.  This notion of setting up these unelected, unaccountable bodies and paying people stupid money is nonsense.  Power in this regard should also be brought back to the Parliament.Deputy Tuffy mentioned backbenchers.  It would be great if Parliament was more inclusive, and I agree with what she said in that regard.  Some 76 new Deputies were elected in the last general election and there is a fair bit of frustration among many of them and a feeling that they are not playing an active role in what is happening in the House.  I can understand members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party being very frustrated.  The Technical Group seems to be getting a fairer crack of the whip than the backbenchers in Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  We all have a mandate and were sent here by the people and we all should play an active role in what goes on.For a number of years this country has been much too centralised.  It is probably one of the most centralised countries in western Europe.  Power is very much in the hands of a few.  Currently, it is difficult for Parliament to hold the Executive to account because of the way things are structured.  It would be great if the new coalition Government had the honesty to tackle this issue in a positive way.There is a complete lack of local government due to this centralisation.  We do not have real local government.  The councillors elected to local government in my constituency, and throughout the State, are not placed in a decision-making role.  Instead we have civil servants making decisions and it is too bad if people do not like those decisions because the civil servants will still be there after the next election.  If that role were given to elected local representatives, we could throw them out at the next election if we do not like how they behave.  Some people argue that there is greater expertise in the Civil Service and that councillors cannot be trusted on certain matters.  The electorate needs to grow up in this regard and to stop electing people who are not competent to make decisions at local government level.  If we change the structure of local government, citizens will have to be responsible and make sure they elect people of quality who are capable of fulfilling their role in a positive way.Placing elected councillors in charge of the decision-making process will ensure a greater link between them and the people who elect them.  Democracy is lacking in local government, with citizens having little say in how they are governed or in decisions made in their name.  There is only a pretence at consultations with citizens.  In my constituency, for example, a group of civil servants, consultants and engineers came up with eight options for a bypass of Wexford town.  These options were set out in a map which was put on display to the public.  For six or 12 months people fought about it and protested about it going through their lands.  The decision makers eventually imposed the route which suited them best.  That is not consultation.  Local people had no say in the final route or even any of the options.Making the options available to the public in cases like these and letting people argue over them for a period of time is not good enough.  Consultation would involve engaging the public before any routes are planned.  Apart from civil servants, we have a significant over-usage of consultants in the planning process.  When I was seeking planning permission to build the Wexford Youths complex in Ferrycarrig I had to make five applications before I eventually obtained all the permissions I required.  Members would hardly believe how many consultants' reports I had to provide, none of which was cheap.  I had to provide four different road surveys and traffic reports on the back road into the complex.  I had to do reports on how the development would affect plant life and animal life and also had to supply water treatment reports.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I was constantly pushed towards consultants who were required to do this and that.  The decision-makers are reneging on their responsibilities.  In case there is trouble later on they want to be able to say they made the decision on the basis of a report by such and such a consultant.  Local authorities must take power back into their own hands and make the decisions in these matters.A significant difficulty for local authorities is the question of funding.  Income from planning levies — a gravy train in recent years — has now disappeared.  Instead they must retain very high rates.  Rents in the State have generally fallen by 50% — mine certainly have — but rates have increased.  In Dublin city centre, where I have some commercial units, rates have gone up by 5% in each of the last three years whereas rental income has continued to decline.  There is no linkage between rates and the markets.  Unfortunately, local authorities throughout the country are facing funding shortfalls.  We have the most poorly funded local government in Europe and the entire structure must be changed.  I am in favour of giving local authorities a percentage of income tax collected and letting people see exactly where their money goes in return for the services they receive locally.Returning to the issue of Dáil reform, one Member remarked last night that this is not a debating Chamber but a legislative Chamber.  However, legislative work requires effective debate.  Deputy Joe Costello threw cold water on the motion put forward by the Technical Group in Private Members' time this week.  I find that a strange approach.  We were not claiming to have all the answers but we wanted to put ideas out for debate.  Our proposals are worth talking about.  None of us has all the answers and the 166 Members of the House should be willing to discuss issues and to learn from one another.I agree with other speakers that Dáil attendance rates are a cause for concern.  There are more schoolchildren in the Visitors Gallery most of the time than there are Members in the Chamber.  The children must look down and wonder where we all are.  I do not watch television and had never seen coverage of the Chamber before I was elected.  The greatest shock to me since coming to the House is the number of Members who desert the place after the Order of Business.  One would think a fire alarm had been set off.We must work towards accountability, transparency and democracy.  The people want a say in how the country is governed.  They put 166 Deputies in this Houses in order to have an impact on governance.  If we are going to have half a dozen people running the country while the majority of Members are mere spectators who get to have their say but without any effect, it is a false process.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The debate on Dáil reform is necessary and welcome.  However, reform should not be just talked about; it must be delivered.  I was elected to Roscommon County Council in 1999 and am aware of the work done by councillors in local authorities throughout the country.  Many are also members of vocational education committees, regional authorities and county enterprise boards.  Many people do not take a great interest in their work or that of politicians in general.  The findings of various tribunals, particularly in respect of the corruption of certain members of one political party, mean politicians have lost the trust of the people.  The tribunals took away respect for politicians because people no longer trust them or politics in general.This debate must offer a new window of hope.  Deputy Wallace observed that when people do not like what a politician does they can vote him or her out.  Unfortunately, this country is run by the HSE, the NRA and others who were not elected by the people but held the ultimate power.  If one wants a medical card or a bed in this country, people should not go to politicians but to someone within the system.  In Ireland we have a very strange view of how politics works.  People want politicians to be as white as snow but they also want politicians to break every rule in the book to get people what they want.When canvassing over the years, people who had returned from the UK never entered into talk such as "Good man Frank" or "That's a lovely dog" or "That's a lovely garden".  They wanted to know about the party manifesto and when they received the manifesto they read it.  If they had any questions, they raised these issues.  In 99% of cases, locals never asked what about the manifesto or for what the candidate stood.  They used to say that they knew the party or that they knew the candidate.  In Ireland we deserve a little better.  With the new Dáil and Seanad we will get better.I hear people say that I am not shouting loud enough but it is not about shouting loud enough.  It is about listening to the people and delivering without being controversial.  In politics, one has a personality and one represents people through one's personality.  If one is a wild man, one should be that.  Members should try to be honest with people.When the Taoiseach announced reform of the Seanad over 18 months ago, he was ridiculed.  I was at the dinner that night and there was shock among many politicians and people in the Fine Gael Party.  He made a forthright decision to abolish rather than reform the Seanad and it is up to people to decide that matter in the coming months.  I remember a report on reform of the Seanad produced by a previous Leader of the Seanad.  I said to a man at the time that it looked like the Seanad was going to go but he said that we should pay no heed to it because it was just another report.  The people became sick of reports and we must reform.  I welcome the reform.  We must be open and honest with the electorate.  I thank the Opposition because they must oppose.  We must oppose when issues are wrong and we must work together when the goal is good for Ireland Incorporated.  I welcome Dáil reform.  As a Government, we must deliver.  If we say we are going to do it, we must do it.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I am glad to speak on this issue, which we have spoken about from time to time in this House.  Speaking about it repeatedly does not mean we have done much about it.  Reforms that have taken place since I first became a Member have dramatically reduced the power, influence and authority of Members elected to the House by people.  That is what is strange.  A few years ago, on the Order of Business, one could ask a question of the Taoiseach or a Minister.  It may not have been in order.  The Member raising the question had the option of accepting the answer given, if the question was in order, or referring the matter to an Adjournment debate that night.  There was no reference to sections 21, 31, 42 or Standing Orders.  There was no nonsense.  It went direct and straight to the point for an Adjournment debate on that night.  Reform took place and now one must raise a matter under Standing Orders 32 or 21 or something else.  Eventually, one gets to the position one could have gotten to previously.  After 25 years, we have managed to make it more difficult.Every time reform takes place, we find restrictions imposed on the Parliament.  When this happens to the Dáil or the Seanad, the power in the hands of administrators is increased dramatically.  That is the way it must work.  We cannot talk about Dáil reform in isolation without political reform in general and public administration reform.  Fair dues to the Government, which is doing that.  It is part of the programme for Government and I hope it will work.We do not work in isolation.  Reference has been made to local authorities.  Local and national authorities must sit easily together but one cannot grow at the expense of the other.  Many Members spoke in this House of the need for more power for local authorities.  This is a direct threat to Members.  Devolving authority to other bodies, subordinate or otherwise, means one ends up with less power and authority.  People will say that local authorities should have the right to raise taxes.  They have the right to do so but no Minister can give total unlimited power to other bodies to raise taxes because then the Minister will not be able to raise taxes.  That is how it works.  It is a balancing act.Regarding Deputy Wallace's point about Members' attendance, in the beginning there were more Members present in the Chamber.  I refer to the beginning as 25 years ago and it depends when one started.  One had to be in the House if one wanted to speak.  If one was not in the Chamber, one could not speak.  There was no list  system and the order in which people presented in the Chamber determined the order in which they were called to speak.  It was very time consuming but the system has now changed.  At that time, no one was allowed to read a script.  They were ordered to sit down immediately if they tried to do so.  However, things changed.  I knew things had changed forever when I saw a Member who did not manage to speak but had a script ready and had issued it to the press.  It appeared in the newspapers the next day even though that person had not spoken in the House.  I can still remember who it was and the circumstances in which it happened.  That could be hugely embarrassing in certain circumstances.  It should not happen but that is how things evolved.  Evolution is the enemy of Parliament because it has a habit of taking on a life of its own and taking upon itself powers and presumptions of authority that do not exist.  That is what is crazy.  Over a number of years, Members will eventually realise that they no longer have the powers they once had.  They will ask where it went wrong and the answer is with themselves.  They conceded because it was an annoyance to have to do the tittle-tattle, everyday nonsense of having to legislate, listen to the public, take on board their views, refer to them in the House and speak on behalf of the people.  As a result, over the years we became politically correct.  We have now arrived at the ultimate in political correctness.  People will still be looking for reform in five years, ten years, 25 and 100 years time, if this House has not been replaced by some subordinate body with powers devolved to the House by an elevated body of experts outside.  It is of great importance that the reform is basic and fundamental and recognises the need for the Parliament to be responsive to the needs of the people.  I did not refer to the wants of the people because everyone wants everything.  There is a need to attend to the legislative measures that must be taken to address issues at a given time.

The forum will provide an opportunity for the Government to meet directly many of the most influential members of our diaspora and discuss our priorities for economic renewal, job creation and the restoration of Ireland's reputation abroad.Formal invitations will issue shortly to members of the Global Irish Network and other invitees.  Whereas the precise details of the programme and topics to be considered are currently being finalised, I can confirm that the forum will meet in several different formats, including plenary sessions, panel discussions and breakout working groups.  The topics to be discussed will cover specific economic areas identified as priorities in the programme for Government.  The importance of engaging the current and future generations of the global Irish and the role of Irish culture in promoting Ireland abroad will also feature as important themes.The 2009 forum, in which I participated, led to the implementation of a series of significant initiatives across a range of areas, including business network development, innovation, tourism, the promotion of Irish culture and diaspora engagement.  The report of the first forum and its two subsequent progress reports are available on my Department's website.  In addition, in the context of preparing for the 2011 forum, a comprehensive review of all the recommendations was undertaken by my Department, in consultation with all other relevant Departments.  A copy of this review will be circulated and made available on my Department's website.The Global Irish Network consists of more than 300 people from 37 countries.  The members include some of the most influential Irish and Irish-connected individuals abroad and they provide Ireland with an invaluable resource of international expertise from which we can draw as we work towards economic recovery.  Since its establishment in February 2010, three broad functions have characterised the work of the network: an advisory and facilitation function; a mechanism for disseminating information about the Irish economy and other significant developments; and its use as a means of delivering or assisting with the delivery of specific initiatives.  The members have also been an invaluable resource to our ambassadors and consuls general in their work of promoting Ireland abroad.

I compliment the Tánaiste for recently bringing the Irish ambassadors home for a detailed discussion over two days, which was a very positive initiative.Will the Tánaiste outline the level of engagement on his part since his appointment with members of the network?  In particular, when he was in the United States recently did he have the opportunity to engage with network members there?  With regard to the impending forum scheduled for 7 and 8 October, what will be the significant difference between that and the previous forum?  I note that the Taoiseach indicated there would be a larger number of interests involved in the upcoming event, suggesting there would be more of a follow-through on the ideas and proposals that emerged in the first forum.  What steps has the Tánaiste taken to follow through on the proposals in the initial report?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I have previously acknowledged that convening the Farmleigh event and setting up the Global Irish Network was very positive and constructive.  It was done by my predecessor as part of the previous Government.  The Deputy knows I criticised the previous Government on many issues but this is not one of them.  This was a very good initiative which was very successful.  As a result of the potential generated, we have decided to convene a second event.The upcoming event will not be in Farmleigh because the number of members of the Global Irish Network has grown since the first event, with the current number at more than 300.  It is intended to hold the upcoming event at Dublin Castle.  I envisage that the emphasis will be less on what we should do and more about action.  There will be a more specific agenda built on what has happened since the last forum convened.  As I indicated regarding actions that have been undertaken since the last forum, I will set out in tabular form each of the specific objectives and initiatives proposed by the participants at the Farmleigh forum and the action taken with each of them.  I do not propose to go through it here as it would take too long.With regard to my engagement with forum members, when I was in the United States around St. Patrick's Day there was no formal forum event but members attended various events where I was present.  In recent visits to London and Paris we took the opportunity to convene members of the forum in two respects; there was a large trade gathering and we also convened groups of ten or 12 members to speak with me and representatives of State agencies about initiatives we must undertake, particularly in how to grow Irish trade abroad.

The diplomatic initiative announced by the Tánaiste has this as its overarching objective.  It has also sought to ensure understanding of — and support for — Ireland's approach in respect of the EU and IMF programme.To this end the Government is engaging at senior levels with fellow EU member states.  We are making clear the economic and financial realities confronting us and the steps we have taken to get the public finances in order, to repair the banking sector and to restore growth.  We are emphasising our determination to see this process through to a successful conclusion and we count on the continuing solidarity of partners.  We seek to inform and to persuade, pointing to the benefit for the eurozone and EU as a whole of Irish success.There are three tracks.  First, members of the Government avail of every appropriate opportunity to meet their EU colleagues and representatives of the European institutions; second, there is our embassy network in EU capitals; and third, we look to keep EU diplomatic representatives in Dublin fully briefed.The Deputy will be aware that a team from the ECB, European Commission and the IMF team completed in mid April the first quarterly review of progress in implementing the support package.  This review endorsed the decisive actions by the Government to take control of our banking sector and to address our public finances.  The Government has achieved its objective for this review and successfully negotiated the inclusion in the revised memorandum of understanding of a number of the programme for Government commitments, including the jobs initiative, the reversal in the reduction in the national minimum wage and the comprehensive spending review.  We will continue work under the initiative and messaging will be adapted to take account of further developments in the eurozone.

They are very well respected in America for having seen what was happening for what it was but there are others who have contributed reports.  These people are clear in contending that the ECB and IMF package is an injustice.  Core states such as Germany, France and others are punishing peripheral states——

My interpretation of the diplomatic issue when it was announced was that I saw it as countering the narrative sent out that Ireland was reckless, feckless and irresponsible and therefore we must now be prudent and have austerity to cleanse us of all that.  It is critical that we lean on those esteemed international views to counter the narrative and tell the truth about what happened here.  The vast majority of Irish people were failed by those in authority and those whom they trusted at the time.  This Government has such a strong mandate because it promised to right all those wrongs.  What are we doing strategically in terms of our European and international partners, including the other 186 members states of IMF?  What have we done to engage with the IMF in terms of its regulatory role and what are the timeframes and objectives of this initiative?
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	234	While one can point to any number of economists who hold a certain opinion, it is equally possible to find a tranche of economists, both domestically and internationally, who will set out an entirely different view.  It is prudent for the Government to assess the differing growth perspectives for the economy and make a judgment on that basis.  We required the intervention of the EU and the IMF last November through no fault of the vast majority of citizens of this State.  Everybody is paying a heavy price but we have no alternative.  I am not aware that the Deputy's party is proposing any magical solution.  In opposition, Fine Gael and the Labour Party made it clear that while the terms and conditions of the EU-IMF package may not be fully palatable, there was no alternative to it and on that basis we are determined that the State will rise to the challenge.  Despite the scaremongering and views to the contrary, it is clear that we are on course to meet our objectives of making repayments.The Deputy referred to the core countries.  Clearly the various states are at different economic stages and some economies are doing better than others.  While Ireland's economy was forging ahead, other member states were not doing as well.  Solidarity is required but we must also understand the position of other member states.  That is the basis for European partnership even if a considerable number of people would like to forget it.  Our intention is to counter the negative perceptions held about Ireland but, by and large, the opinions across the European Union and beyond is that we are performing well in terms of meeting our targets.

The need for a better deal was clearly outlined in media reports when the Tánaiste launched this initiative.  I would have thought the intention behind it was to secure a better deal for Ireland, but the Minister of State is arguing that we are doing well and should talk up Ireland.The Tánaiste will be aware of certain media reports that have caused alarm.  Wikileaks released information regarding his private comments to the US embassy on the Lisbon treaty which differed from his public approach at the time.  It is important that he makes it clear to the Irish people that what is being stated in public in this diplomatic initiative is the same as what is being said in private to those in power.

We have already succeeded in meeting some of our objectives, as I pointed out in my initial response to the Deputy's question.  There has been a significant change to the memorandum of understanding, which we were told last year was not possible.  This shows that the Government can affect change through inventiveness and creativity even within the restraints and parameters of the IMF programme.  There is scope for the Government to put its stamp on the programme by encouraging job creation and growth and 2011 will be the first year of growth in the past four years.  That in itself is quite an achievement and, as the Deputy is aware, our exports are performing well and there is considerable positivity around.In respect of the other terms and conditions of the package, we are actively seeking better pricing and a reduction in the interest rate.  We want parity with the other two member states, Portugal and Greece, which are involved in EU-IMF programmes.  This is a priority for the Government.  The Tánaiste has engaged in a significant level of bilateral work.  He visited Paris to meet counterpart, Alain Juppé, while the Minister for Finance met his counterpart, Christine Lagarde.  I have met my French, Polish, Slovak and Greek counterparts and have visited Berlin.  Ours is a very determined and proactive approach.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	239	On Sunday, 15 May there were apparently co-ordinated demonstrations to mark Naqba Day by Palestinians and others in the Occupied Territories and neighbouring countries.  On the Lebanese and Syrian borders with Israel and the occupied Golan, groups of some hundreds broke away from larger demonstrations and tried to break through the Israeli border fences.  Israeli forces opened fire and 14 demonstrators were killed, ten from Lebanon and four from Syria.  There were other incidents on the borders of the West Bank and Gaza and at the Israeli embassy in Cairo.It is clearly a matter of concern where numbers of demonstrators are killed in circumstances like this and I would, on the face of it, agree with the Deputy that this action seems heavy handed.  Demonstrations should not end up in deaths and this applies both to security forces and those organising the demonstrations.  Frankly, however, we have no clear picture of what took place, in particular where or why troops opened fire.  In Lebanon, UN troops were on the scene and will be submitting a report on what happened.  It is also true to say that in Lebanon and certainly in Syria, it would normally be very difficult for such large numbers of demonstrators to make it to the border, which is a very sensitive military zone, and there must be a suspicion that some people may have been deliberately encouraging a confrontation with Israel.I entirely sympathise with the deep frustration of Palestinians who feel that history is moving all around them in the Middle East while their plight remains unresolved but clearly trying to storm a tense and sensitive military border which has been the site of numerous deadly attacks is very unwise and risks further tragedies and I am also concerned about those who perhaps cynically misdirect the frustrations of ordinary demonstrators in this way.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	240	The human rights organisations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have called on Israel to launch a thorough and independent inquiry into the killings of the protestors.  The Middle East director for Human Rights Watch, Sarah Lee Whitson, stated: "In a too-familiar pattern, Israeli troops responded to stone-throwing youths with live bullets, with predictably deadly consequences...  The evidence shows a disturbing disregard for protesters' lives."  There is nothing unusual about protests being organised.  Protests are regularly organised and advertised in Dublin.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The notion that kids who throw stones could end up dead is unacceptable.  If riots in Dublin resulted in two deaths, the reports would be all over the world's media and there would be uproar.  Does the Tánaiste not think he should express to the Israeli ambassador his disquiet over the death of 13 or 14 people?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	243	It is not okay for 14 people to be killed in a demonstration.  It is not okay in any circumstances.  I do not condone that in any way.  I made it clear in my reply to this question that demonstrations should not end with people dying.  I do not care what force was involved.  People involved in a demonstration should not be killed.UN troops were on the scene in Lebanon.  UNIFIL and UNDOF troops were present on the Lebanese border and it is possible that UNDOF troops may also have been nearby in Golan.  I understand the Lebanese Army was responsible for decisions on that side.  It is expected that there will be a report from the UN troops present about what happened.  When it becomes available, I will give it a great deal of attention.  The matter will be discussed between Ireland and Israel but I would like to see the report first.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Ireland has been famous for its neutrality for a long time.  We were right to agree with the imposition of sanctions against Syria, even though some people might think I would not favour that.  However, I still do not understand why the Israeli ambassador has not been spoken to by the Government to express our disquiet because what happened is unacceptable.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Following a Government decision on 24 May, the transfer of trade promotion functions from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to the Department of Foreign Affairs took place yesterday.  The transfer gives my Department the lead role in trade promotion.  The transfer of functions will, on a practical level, give my Department responsibility for the management of the export trade council to be established, following a commitment in the programme for Government, and for the joint economic commissions Ireland maintains with a number of countries.Management of the trade council, which the Minister will chair, will give my Department a key role in implementing aspects of the trading and investing in a smart economy strategy.  It will also mean a closer relationship with Enterprise Ireland, particularly in trade missions led by the Minister and myself.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation retains lead responsibility for trade policy, which includes representing Ireland's trade interests in the context of the EU common commercial policy and at the World Trade Organisation.The promotion of Ireland's economic interests has always been a core strand of the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Department and the embassy network have been particularly active in efforts to restore Ireland's international reputation, which has been affected by the economic and financial crisis and to support the export-led growth which is crucial to our recovery.Ireland still has many challenges to face as we seek to return to growth and Irish companies are turning to both emerging and more established markets for new opportunities.  Embassies can, by virtue of their status, gain access to the highest levels of government, media and business in host countries, thus providing a platform to promote Ireland and Irish companies.  The enhanced role in trade promotion for my Department should provide a renewed emphasis for this work and help facilitate a stronger relationship with all Departments and agencies responsible for supporting the growth of Irish exports.

It makes sense that the Department and our embassies, in particular, would have a critical role to play as promotional agents and a shop window for Ireland.  I am unimpressed at the diary of trade missions in which Ministers are proposing to take part but perhaps there are plans we have not heard about.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on that?The establishment of an export trade council is a key element of the programme for Government.  While we support this, I was a little concerned by a reply to a parliamentary question by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in which he suggested there may be no need for the council.  He stated: "The Government is conscious of the need to avoid establishing new groups and bodies unless absolutely necessary and, therefore, will consider whether any amendments to the membership and terms of reference are needed to realign the existing foreign trade council with the objectives of the Government".  Will there be an export trade council or not?  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation seems to be at odds with the Minister of State and this is not the first area of divergence we have discovered within Government.  Will the Minister of State chair the council, if it is established?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I welcome the Deputy's support.  There will be more trade missions and they will be announced as they arise.I assure the Deputy there will be an export trade council under the aegis of my Department and it will be chaired by the Minister.  It will have some of the characteristics of the foreign trade council that was under the aegis of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The programme for Government contains a strong commitment to including private sector exporters as well as relevant Ministers and agencies and their voice will be important on the council.  It is intended that the council will have a view on trade missions and it will have a role in advising how the Department can best advance trade throughout the globe.Earlier the Taoiseach, the Minister, the Minister of State and I addressed ambassadors who have returned from all over the world in our Department.  Various agencies were represented at that gathering.  We will bring all these strengths together and adopt a more co-ordinated approach to this work, which they have always done.  We are strongly of the view that it will be a positive contribution to rebuilding Ireland's reputation and trade.

Given policy will rest with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and promotion will rest with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there may be a lack of clarity on the formulation of policy.  What administrative structures will be put in place to ensure such difficulties do not arise?

There will be a service level agreement with Enterprise Ireland and my Department will have a working relationship with all the agencies.  The EU Commission has competency for multilateral negotiations and, therefore, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will engage in that aspect of the trade brief.  Promotion will rest in my Department.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Ireland's position on the United States trade embargo of Cuba is long standing and well known.  Ireland and other EU member states support an annual draft resolution at the UN General Assembly introduced by Cuba rejecting the extra-territorial effects of the US embargo.We and our EU partners are not persuaded that the continued US embargo on Cuba is contributing in a positive way to the democratic transition in Cuba; this position has been expressed on many occasions in contacts with the United States.  I am aware that opinions in the US on this issue are divided.  Cuba remains an important domestic political issue in the United States, involving the views of many displaced Cubans who have taken refuge there.  However, this is an issue which will have to be worked out within the United States itself, and not on this side of the Atlantic.With the release this year of all 75 political prisoners incarcerated in 2003, the possibility for a new phase in Europe's relationship with Cuba has been opened up.  EU-Cuba co-operation in a number of fields such as food security, climate change and the environment have been resumed, a political dialogue with an emphasis on human rights has been instituted, and we are currently examining how the EU might deepen the bilateral relationship further.  The outcome of the recent congress of the Cuban Communist Party suggests that considerable reforms are being considered within Cuba, which will open up possibilities for further co-operation between Europe and Cuba.Independent of any development in the relationship between the United States and Cuba, the European Union and Ireland will continue to bilaterally develop our own contacts with Cuba in accordance with our own criteria, with a particular emphasis on social and economic development and human rights.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his indulgence.  Unfortunately, Deputy Finian McGrath's mother passed away last night and he is unable to take this question today.  I extend my condolences to him and his family.I thank the Tánaiste for his response and for restating this country's support of the annual resolution at the UN on the embargo on Cuba.  Perhaps the Tánaiste could go further.It is interesting to note that the EU has taken a great interest in how the Cubans are dealing with human rights issues within Cuba but there seems to be a great reluctance to look at how the United States of America is dealing with the human rights of the Cuban people by continuing to enforce the embargo which is having a considerable impact on the Cuban economy and the health and wealth of the Cuban people.  Given that George Shultz, the former US Secretary of State, said in June 2009 that the embargo had been a failure by every measure, would the Tánaiste use the close contacts that are available and have been highlighted this week through WikiLeaks and the American Embassy to convey the views of the Government that the Americans should finally lift the embargo once and for all and use those back channels through which the Americans get much information about the State?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I join Deputy Pringle in expressing my sympathy to Deputy Finian McGrath.  I had not known of his bereavement.  I am sorry to hear of it.Deputy Pringle asked about the European Union position on Cuba.  The common position was adopted in 1996 in the context of the EU's commitment to a democratic transition in Cuba.  It provided a framework for co-operation with Cuba on a range of social, economic and human rights issues.  Progress on achieving the goals set out in the Common Position are examined regularly by the EU General Affairs Council.With regard to our own intentions on bilateral co-operation with Cuba, there have been a number of discussions with Cuban officials with a view to concluding a bilateral co-operation agreement which would bring together Irish and Cuban interlocutors to develop economic, cultural, scientific and other ties.  There are a number of promising areas of co-operation including in the biotechnology field which could be facilitated by a bilateral agreement.  There are also strong tourism and cultural ties reflected in the recently held Irish cultural week and the CeltFest music festival which has been held two years in a row to considerable local acclaim.In the coming weeks, political consultations will be held with Cuba in Dublin with a view to advancing our dialogue and to examining future co-operation.  Our position on the United States trade embargo is well known.  It is a matter that has been communicated directly to the United States and does not need to be mediated through WikiLeaks or anywhere else.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I join in the expressions of sympathy to Deputy Finian McGrath.  His late mother often reminded me that she was the midwife where I was born at the Grove Hospital in Tuam.  She was a lovely woman.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	258	Ireland's long-standing concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza is well known.  The slight relaxation in the blockade in the past year has been completely insufficient.  We recognise that Israel is entitled to prevent the transport of weapons and genuinely military materials into Gaza, and to check cargoes in this context, but other goods should not be impeded.  Along with our EU partners, we continue to press for a full opening up of the border crossings into Gaza to allow unimpeded flows of humanitarian aid, and normal commercial and human traffic.We will continue to press the Israeli Government to do all possible to facilitate those wishing to transport humanitarian goods to Gaza, and in particular to avoid any repetition of the unacceptable use of force against last year's flotilla.  I recognise the essentially humanitarian motivations which gave rise to last year's Gaza flotilla, and also to the further flotilla now being planned.  However, my Department's essential advice remains that people should not attempt to sail to Gaza, and certainly should not attempt to break through a naval blockade of the kind which Israel has imposed on Gaza.  I am deeply concerned that there is real potential for a similar disastrous outcome this year.  I cannot support a project which would involve Irish citizens engaging in actions which could lead them into danger.  The United Nations Secretary General Ban has also called on Governments to discourage such flotillas, which clearly have the potential to escalate into violence.Finally, the port of Gaza can never handle more than a fraction of the territory's needs, so the only real solution is the full opening of the land crossing points.  I repeat the EU's call on Israel to do that, so that there would be no need for actions such as the planned flotilla.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The Minister is aware that nine activists were brutally killed in last year's flotilla by the Israeli forces in an attack that was rightly condemned by the House in an all-party motion.  It condemned the Israeli assault on the first peace flotilla and, rightly, described the blockade of Gaza by Israel as an illegal act, yet the blockade continues and continues to visit appalling suffering on the people of Gaza.The refusal of the Israeli authorities to allow water treatment plants and sewerage treatment plants to be constructed means that 80 million litres of sewage is being pumped into the Mediterranean Sea on a daily basis.  A total of 85% of the waters around Gaza which belong to the people of Gaza are restricted and Palestinians trying to enter those waters are shot at regularly, as well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the destruction of the infrastructure in that territory as a result of the previous Israeli attack.The reason I remind the House of those facts is because it is in that context that one must ask what is changing to make the situation better.  The Tánaiste and this House said it is an illegal blockade, that we want it to end, that the suffering should end, that the attack on the previous flotilla should not have happened and should not be repeated.  However, nothing happens.  Israel is not sanctioned and its behaviour does not change.  In that context is it not right and justified that people of good conscience from dozens of countries across the world would try to breach that blockade to bring aid and solidarity to the people of Gaza because it is an illegal blockade and they need that assistance?I know the Tánaiste is not doing it for the same reasons but in calling on people not to go, he is echoing what Israel is now calling for in saying it does not want the flotilla to travel.  I call on the Tánaiste to insist that the Israeli authorities allow the flotilla through the illegal blockade.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	260	What we and our colleagues in the European Union are insisting on is that the blockade on Gaza be lifted.  It is both the Irish Government's and the European Union's view that the blockade of Gaza is unacceptable and counter productive and we have repeatedly called for the unconditional opening of the crossing points to normal movement.  Indeed, the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union has stated that in conclusions to its meetings.  That view is communicated by our Government, by EU representatives and other member state Ministers to Israel at every opportunity.  On the ground, the European Union is engaged with the Palestinian Authority in plans to increase both the physical and administrative capacity on the Palestinian side of the crossing points into Gaza.I understand entirely the motivation of those who participated in last year's flotilla and I understand the motivation and genuine intent of those who intend to participate in the flotilla this year.  However, my Department has a responsibility to provide advice to people who intend to travel, whether by flotilla or however, and that advice must express to people whether we consider there are dangers associated with that travel.  We are very clear that this flotilla poses a danger to those travelling on it and we are discouraging people from doing that.  In doing that, we echo the view that has been expressed by the UN Secretary General.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The organisers of the Irish ship to Gaza, the Irish leg of the flotilla, contacted the Minister's office a number of weeks ago and sought a meeting to discuss the departing Irish part of the flotilla, but they have received no response.  Will the Minister meet the organisers of the Irish ship to Gaza to discuss their trip?  Also, when will sanctions be imposed?  When will the call for sanctions against Israel for its refusal to lift the blockade be applied?  Israel will not change its behaviour or lift its illegal blockade unless Europe — starting with some states in Europe — stands up and says that sanctions must be applied against a state that is flouting international law and human rights.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I will repeat the travel advice the Department has issued in respect of Gaza.  The advice states clearly that we advise against all travel to the Gaza Strip, including the waters off Gaza and goes on to explain the reasons for that.I wish to be very clear that I do not want anything I say to convey in any way the view or impression that the State lends its support to this flotilla.  We understand why it is taking place and the motivation of the people involved in it, but we must be very clear on where we stand with regard to support for it.  It is not supported by the State and cannot be supported by it.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	263	Will the Minister meet the representatives of the organisers?

With regard to what the European Union is doing about Israel, it is clear the blockade on Gaza should be lifted.  We must get moving on the talks between Israel and Palestine, which have been stalled for a long period.  I was encouraged by what President Obama said in his speech a few days before his arrival in Ireland.  When the Taoiseach and I met President Obama, this was one of the issues we discussed with him.  We discussed the necessity for both the United States and the European Union to use our good offices to get talks started again and to try and get a settlement to what has been a long, difficult dispute which has caused so much grief.  Gaza is very much a central part of that.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 15 and 42 together.The Government welcomed the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of Resolution 1973 which demanded the immediate establishment of a ceasefire in Libya as well as a complete end to violence and attacks against civilians.  Resolution 1973 authorised the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya as well as "all necessary" additional measures in order to help protect civilians.  The Government supports the implementation of Resolution 1973 in a manner that is proportionate, targeted and avoids civilian casualties.Today, civilians in Libya remain under attack by Colonel Gadaffi, including through indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas and the use of cluster munitions.  The text of Resolution 1973 specifically authorises member states:to take all necessary measures...to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in [Libya]...while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory.NATO has stated that its aerial actions to protect Libyan civilians by disabling the command structure and weapons being used by the regime are entirely in line with the resolution.  Troops on the ground are specifically prohibited by the resolution and are not envisaged.In implementing Resolution 1973, NATO appears to be taking the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties, in stark contrast to the deliberate targeting of civilians by Colonel Gadaffi's forces.  I am aware of unconfirmed reports of the death of civilians, including relatives of Colonel Gadaffi, in a NATO bombing raid on Libya in May.  The Libyan regime is tightly restricting information from Libya, so it is impossible at present to confirm the truth of such reports.  NATO has stated that it regrets any loss of life and emphasised that all NATO targets are military; it does not target individuals.  I welcome the assurances already provided that protecting civilians is the sole purpose of military operations now under way and that no actions will be contemplated which are not in strict accordance with the terms of Resolution 1973.The aim of the current military, political and diplomatic action by the international community is to end the violence and promote a political settlement to the conflict in Libya.  There are no circumstances in which one could envisage Colonel Gadaffi being part of this settlement.  The vast majority of the Libyan people could not accept Gadaffi continuing as their Head of Government, in light of the violence and repression he has visited upon them and his repeated refusal to comply with Resolutions 1970 and 1973.  However, calling for Gadaffi to relinquish power does not amount actively to seeking regime change.  Colonel Gadaffi is, of course, the subject of investigation by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court who is now seeking an arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity.  Ultimately, it remains for Colonel Gadaffi and those around him to draw their own conclusions and recognise that his regime has no political future in Libya.In order to increase the diplomatic pressure on Gadaffi, both the United Nations and the European Union have adopted hard-hitting sanctions against the Gadaffi regime.  The EU promptly implemented the measures in Resolution 1973 including an assets freeze, arms embargo and travel ban, and later added additional individuals and entities, including investment companies and other institutions linked to the regime.  The EU has also been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict and most recently established a technical office in Benghazi to support Libyan efforts to rebuild their society in opposition-held territory.  The role of the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy Al Khatib in exploring what scope exists for a political resolution to the crisis, beginning with a complete and verifiable ceasefire, is also critical and one which Ireland fully supports.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I thank the Minister for his response.  I am sure he is aware of the growing international concern at the NATO operation.  UN Security Resolution 1973 was to prevent Gadaffi from using his army or airforce to attack Libyans.  It is clear that the international community would support those objectives particularly in the context of the Arab spring that has taken place in neighbouring countries in north Africa and is now spreading throughout the Middle East.  The Pan-African Parliament has condemned this.  The Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has expressed concern over the objectives of NATO which have moved beyond the scope of the UN resolution.  Konstantin Kosachev, spokesperson for the Duma foreign affairs committee in Russia, has expressed grave concerns at the attack which led to the killing of Muammar Gaddafi's 29 year old son and three grandchildren, which any right thinking person would have to condemn because it was an attack on the compound where they reside.Does the Tánaiste share the concerns of the Russian Parliament, the Russian Prime Minister and the Pan-African Parliament?  Does he believe there is consistency when there are numerous UN Security Council resolutions against Israel and international condemnation of Israel but no action?  When Irish citizens try to go on a flotilla bringing international aid they are advised not to as they are not supported by the Government.  Where is the consistency in approach?  Where is the NATO operation against Israel to enforce those resolutions?  This is the issue for the international community.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Having seen what has happened since the early part of the year in Libya and in particular at how citizens in Misrata have been attacked by the Gadaffi forces and taking into consideration the difficulties that were encountered with evacuating people from Misrata — to which operation Ireland made a significant financial contribution — nobody can be in any doubt about the way in which the Gadaffi regime has focused its guns on its own civilian population.  A series of UN resolutions, particularly Resolution 1973, were designed to protect civilians.  That is the objective Ireland supports in a manner that is proportionate, targeted and avoids civilian casualties.One of the difficulties in forming an assessment of the impact of particular actions is the degree to which there is very little information coming from the Gadaffi-held parts of Libya.  As the Deputy will be aware they have closed down the entire communications operation there.  It goes without saying that nobody has any desire to see physical harm come to Muammar Gadaffi or any member of his family.  That is not the objective of the UN operation.  Neither, strictly speaking, is regime change part of that operation.The Deputy spoke about the Russian response.  I understand that Russia has now joined the list of countries stating that Muammar Gadaffi does not have a political future in Libya.  They are increasingly trying to play a role in promoting a political resolution.  The Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Lavrov, recently met representatives of the Libyan regime and the Libyan transitional national council in Benghazi.  President Medvedev has sent a special envoy to hold talks with the Libyan rebels in Benghazi all of which is welcome.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Does the Tánaiste agree that the attack on Libya has gone on much longer than anticipated?  President Obama said it would be a matter of days but it is now into months.  Imposing sanctions on Syria is surely a better approach than bombing, as they are doing with Libya.  We would all like to see the end of the Gadaffi regime, as we would with many leaders in that region.  I am not convinced that bombing is the way to resolve problems.  Does the Tánaiste not believe that sanctions would be more effective in the long term and cause considerably less hardship?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	269	Along with the Deputy, I welcome the sanctions being imposed on Syria, which has been done at United Nations level and at European Union level.  At the most recent Foreign Affairs Council, attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, agreement was reached on those sanctions.  In Libya there had been an earlier resolution, Resolution 1970, which essentially imposed sanctions.  The problem was that the Gadaffi forces were attacking in a very vicious manner their own civilian population.  What does one do when a regime starts bombing?It is invidious to be drawing distinctions and comparisons.  In Libya the Gadaffi forces were bombing their own cities.  There is an obligation on the international community at a humanitarian level.  The international community cannot allow dictatorial regimes to engage in that level of attack on their own civilian populations.  I know many countries have very nasty regimes that deal in a very savage way with people who are protesting and so on.  However, when a ruler of a country uses the armed forces of that country to engage in blanket attacks on civilians in his own cities, the international community has an obligation to act in order to protect those civilian populations.

What should the international community do when there is obvious civil strife taking place to the extent that has been taking place in recent months and still continues?  Does the international community and do we as participants in that thinking stand aside and do nothing or do we try to influence in some way as the Tánaiste has set out?  For example there will always be people who will take both sides — sometimes in the same instance.  How does one then resolve the problem?  Does one presume that by the international community doing nothing the problem will go away or will it be seen to give reassurance to the aggressors that they can continue indefinitely and seek out their own way to resolve any problem or put down any disquiet or civil unrest in a most aggressive fashion?I ask the Tánaiste whether there is something more the international community could do by way of diplomatic and other pressures to bring about a resolution that will not end up in the enormous loss of life that continues at the moment.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The international community must respond to an issue such as this one in Libya and it must be through the United Nations.  This is why this was done by way of a United Nations Security Council resolution, which we support.  It needs to be backed up by political and diplomatic work, which is why Ireland supports the work of the special envoy to explore what progress can be made in getting a complete ceasefire, bringing an end to the violence and the conflict, and bringing about the kind of political change for which the citizens of Libya have been calling in much the same way as has happened in the other countries that have been part of the Arab spring — except in this case they were crushed.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Saharawi refugees arrived in Algeria in 1975 and 1976 following the escalation of the conflict over Western Sahara.  The majority of these are sheltered in camps in the south-western desert province of Tindouf, where the Algerian authorities estimate the current number of refugees at some 165,000.  A significant part of the Saharawi population also continues to live in Western Sahara, and many families remain separated.Basic social services in the camps are provided by the Saharawi "government-in-exile", together with the support of the international aid community.  Some of the major organisations on the ground include the World Food Programme, WFP, which provides food assistance, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, which gives assistance in areas including the provision of water, sanitation, health, nutrition and education.In response to the continuing needs in this protracted humanitarian crisis, I recently authorised €250,000 in funding from Irish Aid for UNHCR's operations in the camps.  These funds will be used to support the provision of basic services and to help refugees to maintain contact with their families.  In addition to this direct assistance, UN agencies operating throughout the region can also benefit from the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF, to which Ireland has contributed €81 million since 2006.Ultimately, of course, the only resolution to the plight of the Saharawi refugees will come with a political settlement between Morocco and Western Sahara.  Ireland has a long-standing policy of support for the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara.  We remain strongly supportive of the UN's role and the efforts of UN Secretary General's Special Envoy, Christopher Ross, in trying to promote a political dialogue and settlement and earnestly encourage both Morocco and the Polisario, which I met recently, to engage constructively during talks scheduled to take place next week in New York.

I met Polisario on a number of occasions and also representatives of the Moroccan embassy.  I had made contact with the Algerian embassy in London.  It appears this conflict can be resolved with a bit of effort.  It is difficult in that the Saharawi people clearly have a right to self-determination.  Morocco, which presides over much of the land of Western Sahara, is a monarchy and is undergoing considerable reform at present.  Many of the Moroccan people who live in the northern provinces have an affinity with and roots in Western Sahara.  This region was devastated by colonialism historically by the French and Spanish who, like the British throughout the world, clearly divided and conquered and left behind a devastating legacy that lasts to the present day.I appreciate the comments and commitments of the Minister of State on this matter.  We should make whatever contribution we can based on our own departmental officials' experience of our peace process.  I will be happy to give whatever humble assistance I can and engage with the various protagonists.  In fairness to the Department of Foreign Affairs, it is much more eminently qualified than I am and has many more resources and contacts than I do.  The conflict can be resolved with focused effort.  We need to address the human rights concerns.  I ask the Minister of State to utilise whatever resources are available to reach a conclusion.

A meeting is scheduled for next week with Mr. Christopher Ross in New York.  Ireland will continue, through the dialogue the Deputy described, to support the ongoing process.  There is a blockage at present with regard to a referendum on self-determination and strong efforts are being made internationally to address that problem.  We hope the talks next week will be successful.  I agree with the Deputy that Ireland has a very strong record on finding solutions to its very difficult problems.  I am sure we can help in the international field in this regard.

Given the importance of bringing home to the Irish people the seriousness of circumstances in many locations, such as Western Sahara, where Irish aid is being provided, will she and the Minister for Foreign Affairs consider undertaking a number of visits to critical locations around the world so we can emphasise again to the Irish the importance of maintaining the aid budget, notwithstanding the difficulties we are experiencing?

I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to engage in talks on the Israeli-Palestinian crisis and I welcome his raising the matter with the President of the United States when he was here.  There is much cynicism about international travel but we can make no apologies for it if it concerns international aid.  We must have the full support of the House in terms of the Minister of State engaging proactively in trade missions and furthering Ireland's fantastic role.  Ireland has had a great track record in international affairs and interventions having learned from its own experience of conflict.  It has used its respect and standing in this regard positively.There have been attacks on Ireland's reputation recently, and we began this session talking about them.  Ireland's reputation with regard to conflict resolution and human rights is second to none.  Ireland has had wonderful civil servants over the years.  I urge the Minister of State to lead from the front using recent experience of Ireland's own conflict and others.  She will have the full support of Members on this side of the House when travelling as much as she can throughout the world to promote the aforementioned message and when engaging in trade missions.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 38 together.Decisions relating to the size and scale of the Irish diplomatic network are matters for consideration by the Government.  The scale and presence of the Irish diplomatic network is being considered, along with all aspects of my Department's operations, as part of the Government's comprehensive review of expenditure.  Given the current budgetary situation and recognising the role that our diplomatic network is playing in Ireland's economic recovery, adjustments to our diplomatic network will continue to be strategically focused.  In short, all our missions abroad must continue to deliver benefits for Ireland and must do so in a manner that represents good value for money.I assure the Deputies that my objective is to optimise the capability of Ireland's diplomatic network overseas to promote our key objectives abroad, especially support for our economic recovery.  This is a key priority for me and one that I stressed yesterday when I addressed the conference of ambassadors being held in my Department.  Any expansion of our diplomatic network can only be undertaken against this background, as I am sure the Deputies will appreciate.  At the same time, any proposals to reduce the network must be considered in the same light and balance any potential financial savings that could be achieved against the operational and reputational costs that would be incurred, including writing off investments made over years in the bilateral relationships with the countries in question.  At a time when we need as much international support as possible, it is important to get these decisions right.Ireland has actively developed diplomatic relations with Indonesia since their establishment in 1984.  Our diplomatic relations are maintained on a non-resident basis through our embassy in Singapore and through our Irish Honorary Consul based in Jakarta.  While Indonesia may not be a priority country under the Government's strategy for trade, tourism and investment to 2015, Irish companies, supported by the embassy and State agencies in Singapore, have been meeting with some business success in areas such as telecommunications, software and education services.  Resources are not available at present to establish a resident embassy in Indonesia but the embassy and State agencies in Singapore will continue to support actively Irish companies wishing to do business with and in Indonesia.

I raised the matter in the context of the Asia strategy which, as he is aware, was brought forward in 1999 and has proved particularly effective in building business and political contacts for us in the Asia-Pacific region.If I am correct, the second phase of that Asia strategy, which was from 2005 to 2009, succeeded in driving up Irish exports to the region to approximately €11 billion, more than €2 million ahead of target.  It would seem that this is one of those locations where it is very much in the national interest that we would do some work and try to establish an embassy in Indonesia.  There is also an aid aspect to our possible involvement in Indonesia.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	284	In normal circumstances and if we had the resources, I believe we would be establishing a resident embassy in Indonesia but we are working in the current circumstances within very severe financial constraints and we have to make the most of what we have.  We are in any event examining our total diplomatic and embassy network in the context of the comprehensive spending review.  We may make decisions arising from that.  The position in Indonesia and our interests in Indonesia are catered for from Singapore.  I do not propose to change that in the short term but it is something I will keep under review.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Finian McGrath — the need to protect children from child abuse, drug addiction, homelessness, prostitution and severe mental problems; (2) Deputy Derek Nolan — the need for the Minister to outline measures to address the anomaly in rates legislation which obliges Galway City Council and Waterford City Council to provide a 100% refund of rates in respect of vacant properties as opposed to 50% for other urban authorities; (3) Deputy Simon Harris — the need to develop an opt-out system in regard to the storage of Guthrie cards to ensure the protection of a valuable resource in preventing cases of sudden adult death syndrome; (4) Deputy Paudie Coffey — the establishment of a university of the south east; (5) Deputy Terence Flanagan — the need to continue to provide funding to parents of children who attend Achieve ABA, Kilbarrack, Dublin 13; (6) Deputy Gerald Nash — the need to review and improve ambulance services in Drogheda, and in Louth and Meath in general, in light of the death of a man (details supplied) in Drogheda, County Louth on Thursday, 26 May 2011; (7) Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív — the need to provide OPEX funding to Galway Airport for the next three years; (8) Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn — the need to address the problems caused by the non-completion of an extension at Letterkenny General Hospital, County Donegal; (9) Deputy Mattie McGrath — to ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources the rationale for the imminent closure of the post office in Bansha, County Tipperary; (10) Deputy Robert Troy — to ask the Minister for Transport to reverse a recent decision to withdraw public transport from St. Columba's national school, Cloonagh, Dring, County Longford, given its particular rural location, and to make a statement on the matter; and (11) Deputy Joe Costello — the need to ensure there is adequate supervision of the electoral process for the 2012 elections in Angola.The matters raised by Deputies Joe Costello, Paudie Coffey, Terence Flanagan and Éamon Ó Cuív have been selected for discussion.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I welcome the Tánaiste and the Ministers of State.  Angola is not a country which looms large in terms of Irish and African relationships.  Since the long-running civil war of 27 years ended in 2002, however, a degree of relationship has built up between Angola and Ireland.  Irish Aid is making a contribution in the fight against AIDS, in regard to good governance and combatting the abuse of human rights.The country is oil rich.  The economy is largely based on oil exports which account for 85% of GDP, although the majority of the population live on subsistence and farming.  In that regard, we can see the great diversity and the disproportionate nature of the operation of the economy.A general election is planned for 2012, which is welcome because elections were sporadic during the course of the civil war and afterwards.  The previous election took place in 2008, and it was observed by a European Union mission.  The European Union mission was critical of the conduct of the election and the results were challenged by the main opposition parties.  Subsequently, the President, Don Eduardo dos Santos, reneged on his promise to hold a popular election for the presidency in 2009.  Instead, with a majority in parliament he introduced a constitutional change which appointed him to the presidency for a further two year term.  It is with some trepidation, therefore, that we look at the possibility of the elections going ahead in 2012.In any case, certain provisions have been made to prepare for the election.  A national electoral commission has been established for the purpose of preparing for and running the election.  The problem, however, is that it is composed largely of the ruling party, the MPLA, the popular movement for the liberation of Angola.Democracy is still very much in a fledgling state in Angola and there are serious concerns about corruption, intimidation and so on.  Angola rates poorly in terms of governments.  It scores as low as 44th out of the 48 African countries and fares particularly badly on participation in human rights, sustainable economic opportunity and human development.  The track record on good governance, anti-corruption measures and a fair legislative and judicial system is not the best.  From that point of view, it would be desirable if the European Union and the international community got involved at the earliest stage possible to ensure the forthcoming elections are free and fair.It would seem that the appropriate approach would be to appoint an EU or international observer mission at the earliest stage possible to supervise, in the first instance, the national electoral commission currently in place because it is disproportionately in favour of the ruling party.  That is the stage at which all the registration will take place and where the identification and the authenticity of the electoral process will be determined.  If there is not a supervisory body in place to be present throughout the preparatory electoral process, an observer mission, as happened in 2008, will be coming in cold and will not have the full facts at its disposal.I urge that this aspect be examined.  It is not something the European Union has given sufficient attention to, particularly as very often in a case where there has been a former colonial past the particular country, in this case Portugal, has probably been left with undue responsibility in the area, and that is not necessarily the most desirable way to proceed.  The European Union and the international community should examine it more carefully and get involved at the earliest stage possible to ensure an observer process is established, not just when the election takes place but well in advance of that.I ask the Minister to raise this matter at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, which would be an appropriate forum.  There have been only two elections since 1975 and we would not want an election to be held without it being a proper free and fair election.  Also, I ask if it could be raised in any other appropriate international forum.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I thank Deputy Costello for raising this issue.  I have noted the points he made.The governing party of Angola, the MPLA, has been in power since Angola gained independence in 1975, and President dos Santos has held the position of President since 1979, making him one of Africa's longest-serving rulers.  Angola's first parliamentary election since 1992, and only the second since 1975, took place on 5 and 6 September 2008.  The MPLA won a landslide majority, with 82% of the votes and a total of 191 seats out of 220, which gave it the two thirds majority in Parliament needed to change the constitution.  An EU election observation mission said the elections represented a "positive step towards strengthening democracy", despite some organisational weaknesses and the state's control of the media, but did not go as far as describing the elections as free and fair.  The elections passed off peacefully, which was significant, given that the results of the 1992 elections were violently disputed by the main opposition party UNITA, leading to the re-intensification of the civil war.The adoption of a new constitution in February 2010 established a presidential parliamentary system, under which the Angolan President will not be elected by popular vote but will instead be the head of the party which has the most seats in the Parliament.  A limit of two five-year presidential terms has been set, which would enable President dos Santos to remain in office until 2022 should he so wish, and should the MPLA retain the most seats in Parliament.Angola's next legislative vote — elections to the Parliament — is scheduled to be held in September 2012.  Given its dominance of the national media and of the apparatus of government, the ruling MPLA party has a major advantage going into the polls.  Despite such advantages, economic difficulties, including such austerity measures as reductions in fuel subsidies, mean that a sweeping victory by the MPLA cannot be taken for granted.In recent months, there have been reports of more loosely organised groups of protestors, inspired by the events in North Africa, using the Internet to try to organise support.  The Parliament has passed legislation aimed at limiting the use of the Internet by such groups.The European Union will in due course have to consider the question of mounting an election observation mission to Angola for the elections in September 2012.  A number of factors will be important.  First, the Angolan Government will have to invite such a mission to be present, an invitation which we hope would be forthcoming, in view of the observation mission in 2008.  Second, the resources will have to be available to train, staff, and equip a mission in such a large country.  Third, the situation will need to be assessed by EU heads of mission in the capital, Luanda, in advance of the election campaign, to see if the overall conditions permit a realistic assessment of the electoral process by observers.It is too early at this stage to give a definitive view on these factors, but the Irish Government supports and regularly participates in such electoral observation missions, which are an effective monitoring tool.  The EU collaborates on these missions with other international organisations, such as the United Nations, in seeking to ensure that minimum standards of debate, participation, transparency and accountability are observed during the election process.  Ireland, which is accredited to Angola from our Embassy in Maputo, will consult our EU partners well in advance of the Angolan elections on the key issues which would surround such a mission.I will raise some of Deputy Costello's points, particularly his concerns about the electoral commission, with the Tánaiste.  I am not sure which one of us will attend the foreign affairs Council in June, but it will be on the radar and if there is an opportunity to raise it I will be happy to do so.  I will speak with the Tánaiste about it as well.

In response to a parliamentary question two months ago, the Minister stated that the establishment of a technological university will require new legislation and will require detailed performance criteria for the designation process.  That is the reason I raise this matter on the Adjournment today.  The Minister recognises that a pathway is open to Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology to pursue a technological university for the south east.Waterford Institute of Technology has already done much groundwork in this area and it has achieved very high standards by any international measure.  It is ready and willing to engage in this process.  An independent report commissioned by the previous Government — the Port report — outlines the merits of this case.  It is essential now that the necessary criteria are published as soon as possible to allow full engagement and give clear direction to all stakeholders in this process.  There is a very strong political will across all parties in the south east to achieve this objective.  There is strong collaboration between Waterford IT and Carlow IT.  There is an intention to have a multi-campus university in the south east which can expand to the other counties.  Deputies from all counties in the south east and from all parties are very anxious that this process would progress as soon as possible.The south east is the only region without a university and this is reflected in the higher than national average unemployment figure, which lies at 18.5%.  There are fewer graduates in the region when compared with other areas.  The south-east university does not have to aspire to duplicate existing universities.  Both WIT and Carlow IT have all the courses and the capacity to meet the third level requirements of university status.  We now need urgently from the Government the criteria, the legislation and the support to allow this to happen.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I thank Deputy Coffey for allowing me speak on this issue.  It is an issue that I support fully.  We have promised in the programme for Government to examine the establishment of a university in the south east.  Over the past few years, campaigners in Waterford and in the south-east region have put a great deal of time, effort and money into the bid to gain university status for Waterford IT.  Despite a very strong campaign, it seems that the groups have drawn a frustrating blank, as decisions were delayed and a key report in the issue was only released in the dying days of the last Government.  Now we have an opportunity to shine the spotlight on the matter once again, and the issue of a technological university is coming into focus.There seems to be confusion as to what exactly a technological university is, as there is no internationally recognised and agreed definition.  This is why I support a call for the criteria defining technical or technological university to be brought forward as soon as possible.  It is important that any changes in the status to WIT or any other IT do not make the institute any less accessible to local students.  Access to good, quality education locally is vital and this has been one of the strengths of institutes of technology.  They do not exclude students who might be seen as less academic, but provide top quality education and training for all students, while offering the chance to progress as far as PhD level if desired.Research shows that students who go to college are less likely to come home to settle after they have graduated.  This is why we need students to have the opportunity to obtain the quality qualifications at home.  Brain drain will not help us create jobs in the south east.  Figures released this week show that unemployment is again growing in Waterford and in the south east.  This needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency.The sooner we bring forward the criteria for defining a technological university, the sooner institutes like WIT can capitalise on increased funding and research opportunities that a designation of this kind would bring.  Having said that, any new criteria must emphasise the highest standards in accountability so that moneys are spent in ways that are prudent and which benefit education and research, rather than on cosmetic enterprises.Ultimately, whatever changes are proposed must be meaningful and helpful and must build on the great work done by all those associated with Waterford Institute of Technology.  We do not want this to be a case of giving something a new coat of paint and a new name for the sake of it.  We want to see the technological university brought to the south east so that our graduates and young people can work and remain there.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank Deputy Coffey for raising this matter and Deputy Conway for her contribution.The question of the establishment of a university in the south east must be considered within the overall reform agenda for the higher education system, outlined in the national strategy for higher education to 2030, which is now the blueprint for further development of the sector.  I am also cognisant of the commitment in the programme for Government that "we will explore the establishment of a multi-campus technical university in the south east."The Minister agrees with the analysis and conclusion of the national strategy for higher education to 2030 that there is no case for the creation of any new universities on the basis set out in section 9 of the Universities Act 1997.However, the Minister also believes that the development of a small number of technological universities, of equal status and of significant strength and quality, with their own legislative framework and a distinct mission that is faithful to the ethos of the technological sector, would complement our existing universities in meeting the full range of needs of students and wider society.  There is strong merit in the development pathway that has been laid out in the strategy for the creation of technological universities. It is important that any process of re-designation focuses on the capacity of amalgamated institutes of technology to meet mission-relevant performance demands.Already, the system is moving to respond to the recommendations of the strategy in a dynamic and organic way.  The driving force behind any discussions should be sustainability and excellence.  Institutes should take time and care to ensure that the choices they make are in the broader public interest as well as in the interests of the institution.  Central to ensuring a designation process with integrity and credibility will be strong and relevant criteria against which proposals for designation can be rigorously assessed and that will maintain and enhance the necessary diversity in the system.To build on the parameters and principles laid out in the national strategy regarding the evolutionary pathway for the institutes of technology, international higher education expert Dr. Simon Marginson was commissioned by the Department of Education and Skills to consider the establishment of benchmarks for redesignation, informed by international developments in this field as well as by the Irish context.  The Department has now received his input, and the Minister has asked the HEA, in its statutory advisory capacity, to engage in a focused consultation on the draft criteria.  We look forward to its response in the coming weeks.  It is intended to publish the criteria when they have been finalised so that institutes of technology will have early direction on the expected demands for designation, enabling them to consider appropriate amalgamation options and prepare for future performance requirements.I have noted the comments of the Deputies and I will happily pass them on to the Minister.  I hope that on the publication of the report there will be an opportunity to discuss this again.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	293	This is an issue with which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Broughan, as my constituency colleague, will undoubtedly be familiar.There is an urgent need for the Minister for Education and Skills to continue to provide funding to the parents of children who attend the Achieve ABA school in Kilbarrack.  This issue is one that was inherited by the new Government.  It was flagged with the new Minister over two months ago and it needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.There are ten teaching staff and eight children attending this school in Kilbarrack on a daily basis.  Effectively, since last September, Achieve ABA has received no State funding in respect of four of the eight students who attend the school.  The situation has been unsustainable for some time and is now coming to a head, with the management giving one month's notice of the school's closure by 24 June if funding is not provided by the Department.  It would be a shame if that were to happen.  The Minister must continue to provide the home tuition grant to parents of children who attend the school.  In addition, the school has submitted a joint proposal, along with Mayo Autism Action, to the Minister and his Department officials for the setting up of an ABA academy which would specialise specifically in the teaching of autistic children through ABA.Achieve ABA is a tightly run school with an excellent track record for the five years in which it has existed.  The average cost for a student in one of the 126 State-funded special schools is €38,725 per annum, which includes the costs to both the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE; in comparison, based on the Achieve ABA model, schooling costs €30,000 per annum per student.  Thus, from a simple economics point of view, there is a saving to be made by the Exchequer in continuing to fund this school and supporting parents and teachers in providing an excellent, first-class service to these children.The Acting Chairman has been to the school, as have I and other Deputies in the House, to see at first hand the great work that is done.  It cannot happen that this school is not allowed to continue.  An academy for children with autism is crucial.  The proposal from Achieve ABA and Mayo Autism will include provision for the educational needs of the children but will also include the provision of psychology, speech and language therapy — which is so important — and occupational therapy, which will be provided by highly qualified and experienced staff.The State spent more than €70 million on pilot projects under the previous Government, but it is a shame to say that no report was ever produced setting out the costs and benefits of these projects.  Clearly, it is working in this school.  Achieve ABA has made a commitment that it will produce a report and set itself up for a peer review within the space of two years of receiving more funding.Funding provided in this area is money well spent.  One system clearly does not suit all children, but we know that children who have attended this school have gone on to mainstream schools, so it has been a major success.  I urge the Minister to visit the school and see the great work that is going on there.  I implore him to continue to provide the home tuition grant to the parents of all children who attend the school.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which provides the Minister with the opportunity to clarify the Department's position with regard to the provision of funding to parents of children who attend the Achieve centre.I understand the Deputy is referring to the Achieve centre in Donaghmede, Dublin 13, which is a privately funded ABA centre.  I wish to clarify that the Department has no direct funding arrangements with the group that operates the centre.  The Minister has been advised that four children attending the centre are using their home tuition funding to pay the fees.  The home tuition scheme, which the Department operates, provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.  Continued funding to the parents of the four children in question through the home tuition scheme will be considered for the next school year in the context of available school placements.The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, for allocating resources to schools to support children with special educational needs.  SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively seeking a placement for their children.A proposal for funding for an academy for children with autism was submitted to the Department for consideration.  The Minister wishes to thank the Deputy for also forwarding a copy of this proposal.  The Department will respond to the submitted proposal shortly.  However, I must remind the Deputy that consideration of this proposal will take account of the Department's policy in this regard, which is focused on ensuring that all children, including those with autism, have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum, with the option, where possible, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.As each child with autism is unique, it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.  The Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services, including additional teaching and care supports.In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil-teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.Reflective of the important role of continuing professional development, the Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including treatment and education of autistic communication handicapped children, picture exchange communications system and applied behaviour analysis, ABA, through the special education support service.The Deputy will be familiar with the ABA pilot scheme which has been funded by the Department for the past decade.  All of the centres which participated in this scheme have been granted recognition as special schools for children with autism.  These schools will operate in line with the Department's policy.  I am pleased to update the Deputy that following their recognition the new schools are currently progressing well in the transitional phase.  Twelve schools have opened and the remaining school is scheduled to open shortly.  It is the Minister's intention to continue to support this transitional process.The pilot scheme was established in the absence of a network of school-based special classes for children with autism which is now available.  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of this network of autism-specific special classes in schools throughout the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 430 classes have now been approved throughout the country at primary and post-primary level, including many in special schools.On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	295	On the day we spoke about Dáil reform, I am very disappointed to see some bad habits continue in that the Minister did not bother to come to the House to take the Adjournment debate.  I always decried this when I was in government and I always made a special attempt to come to the House.  I think I missed an Adjournment debate in the Dáil and Seanad on only two occasions, when I could not possibly have been there.  It is bad form that the Minister responsible does not have the courtesy to be in the House.We are discussing a serious issue, which is the future of Galway Airport because it cannot survive in the short term without operational expenditure funding, OPEX, funding.  For a long time, the Department of Transport, now the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, has felt that Galway Airport is surplus to requirement.  A value for money report was produced, but it was flawed because it suggested people could get from Shannon to Carraroe in an hour or an hour and a half.  One would hardly get from Galway to Carraroe in that time.  It also suggested one could get from Shannon to Carraroe much quicker than one could get from Dublin Airport to Kinnegad and this is quite ridiculous.The decision made by the previous Government, of which I was part, to discontinue the PSO between Galway and Dublin was reasonable because the number of passengers on the route has dropped dramatically since the introduction of the motorway.  PSO passengers between Galway and Dublin amount to 20% of the total passengers whereas they used to amount to 40%.  Galway Airport is vital for access off the island of Ireland.The Department has made a consistent argument that there are too many airports on the west coast and that the number is disproportionate compared to the east coast.  I suggest we look at the facts.  The east coast of Ireland has four airports, two in Belfast, one in Dublin and one in Waterford.  The west coast of Ireland has six airports, and it is one and a half times the length of the east coast and much more indented.  This gives the exact same proportion of airports to mile of coast, not taking into account that the west coast is far more indented than the east coast.The Department always forgets the fact that there are 35,000 people in Connemara along with the 25,000 people west of Galway city, who are landlocked.  Unless one goes to County Mayo, the only way out of Connemara is between Lough Corrib and the sea.  Therefore, it is vital that the airport continues to serve the people.  There is a demand for it.  When I was Minister, I met the IDA which stated the airport was vital for business development in Galway. It is also vital for the local people who use it and for tourism.For some reason, the Minister is making a principle out of a practicality.  The cost is €1.5 million.  It is amazing the same Department can spend €6 million this year on eliminating roundabouts in Galway and putting in traffic lights when, given a free choice, the people of Galway would much prefer to keep the airport and make do with roundabouts for the moment.  It is also a fact that the Department is not short of money this year because it had factored in going ahead with work on the N17 and N18 roads along with work at Newlands Cross and on the road to Arklow.  These projects are not going ahead because the private money to match the public money could not be found.The idea that from a budget of €619 million money cannot be provided for priority transport that is of strategic importance to a region is, in my view as somebody with experience of being a Minister, unrealistic.  The Minister is making a principle out of a practicality.  For some reason, he believes this airport should not be supported and no valid reason has been given for ordering the demise of the airport for the sake of €1.5 million when there are plenty of alternatives.Fine Gael seems to have a problem with airports in the west of Ireland.  It is well known that James Dillon stated all that would run on the airport in Shannon were rabbits.  It is also well known that when Jim Mitchell was a Minister, he stated the airport in Knock would be a soggy boggy hill.  The Minister of State is from Mayo and knows well the huge success of that airport.  Last month was its most successful month ever.  Having failed with regard to two airports in the west it is now targeting another.Galway will not accept the demise of its airport.  We need that airport for development.  In a week that it is rumoured that the Government will remove the enterprise functions from Údarás na Gaeltachta it would appear the Government has decided the west is surplus to requirements and that anything west of Leixlip is irrelevant.  If the Minister wants to think that way that is fine but we will fight tooth and nail to retain our airport, which is so vital to the west of Ireland and the Galway region.

#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	300	The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is aware of the contribution of Galway Airport to the region.  However, the Deputy will be well aware of the difficulties the Minister is now facing with regard to the lack of funding available for the regional airports programme for 2011 and in future years, following the reductions made by the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government.  This is a fact and it is indisputable.  Deputy Ó Cuív will be acutely aware of the funding provided to the regional airport programme for 2011 and its implications, given that he was a member of the Government that made that decision.At the same time as the available funding is reducing, some of the regional airports are becoming more dependent on Exchequer support of some sort. Given the State's current financial position, such a position is obviously not sustainable. A total allocation of €13.4 million is available for the regional airports programme for 2011. Of this allocation, €11.4 million is for current expenditure.  Current expenditure is spent on the PSO air services of which more than €10 million has already been committed, with the remainder being available to cover the operational losses of the airports.Based on a decision of the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government, after existing commitments for PSO air services to July 2011 and for new PSO air services from Kerry and Donegal to Dublin are accounted for, only €0.6 million is available for operational subvention for airports in 2011 whereas €4.8 million was paid out in 2010.  The Department understands that the operational subvention for Galway Airport alone will be in excess of €1.5 million in 2011.A further €2 million in the regional airports programme is available for capital projects at the airports, all of which is committed.  This compares to expenditure of €21.2 million on the programme in 2010 and €200 million in the past ten years.The value for money review published by the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government in January 2011 recommended that funding for PSO air services between Dublin and the regional airports be discontinued when current contracts end in July 2011, except for the Donegal to Dublin service, and that operational expenditure funding, OPEX, and capital expenditure funding, CAPEX, be discontinued for Sligo and Galway airports.  These recommendations took into account changes in EU legislation, airport performances, the substantial investment in surface transport, overlapping catchment areas, the best use of scarce Exchequer resources and the implications for the tourism and business sectors in the regions.The Minister is aware of the implications for both Galway and Sligo Airports arising from these recommendations.  However, in the context of addressing the lack of funding issue, he has to take into account developments in recent years as highlighted in the review and the need to focus on ensuring the sustainability of a strong network of regional airports servicing the public, both in terms of business and tourism.No decision on the funding for regional airports for 2011 and future years has yet been made by the Government.  In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate at this stage to comment on the possible outcome of the Government's deliberations.  However, it is clear that, in the current difficult climate, any decisions will have to take account of available Exchequer funds.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The practice of female genital mutilation is a clear violation of the human rights of women and girls.  It also infringes on children's rights to special protection. The World Health Organisation estimates that between 100 million and 140 million girls and women worldwide are currently living with the consequences of female genital mutilation. In Africa alone, it is estimated that three million girls are at risk annually.Ireland is playing an active role in policy development, funding and research to address this appalling practice.  It is a form of gender-based violence, and is one element in our comprehensive approach to ending such violence through the overseas aid programme.  Through Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Government is co-operating with United Nations agencies in a concerted effort to end the practice of female genital mutilation. We are working closely with the new Agency, UN Women, which is prioritising the prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls.  The Government is providing €1.2 million to support the work of the Agency in 2011.We are also supporting the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in their work on child protection, gender equality, reproductive health and maternal mortality.  At EU level we are working with partners to ensure that violence against women remains a focus of EU development policy, and of programmes funded by the EU in Africa.Progress is being made.  On 6 February 2011, the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation, the United Nations reported that there has been success in reducing the incidence of the practice in a number of African countries. The key to this progress has been the ability to engage with communities and persuade them to take the decision to abandon the practice.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	302	In June 2010, the European Union Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM) adopted a ‘Toolkit to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) People'.  Ireland fully participated in the elaboration of this comprehensive toolkit which guides the work of all European Union (EU) diplomats, including Irish, in overseas missions. Ireland is a member of COHOM's LGBT Task Force which continues to work on LGBT issues.   On 22 March 2011 at the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council, Ireland actively supported a Joint Statement on behalf of 85 countries from every continent entitled ‘Ending acts of violence and related human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity'.Ireland was one of fifteen EU Member States that were part of a cross regional core group that worked to prepare the statement in Geneva. The Joint Statement demonstrates the increasing commitment across the international community to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity.  The Joint Statement builds on a December 2008 United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Statement on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, which was supported by 68 countries including Ireland and all EU Member States.I am aware of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office's programme for promoting the human rights of LGBT people which is a useful instrument setting out British activities in this area. At this point, given the existence of the comprehensive EU toolkit and our own record in advocating for LGBT rights at the UN Human Rights Council, not to mention resource constraints, I do not propose to elaborate separate Irish guidelines. As part of Ireland's commitment to support the work of human rights defenders, in 2010 the Human Rights Unit in this Department developed Guidelines for Irish Embassies and Missions on Human Rights Defenders, which were distributed to all Irish Embassies and Missions. These Guidelines reference the EU Toolkit as well as drawing attention to the risks facing human rights defenders working on sensitive issues, including LGBT matters.A one day seminar on human rights issues was provided within the last two weeks for diplomats about to be posted abroad where attention was drawn to both the EU toolkit and the Guidelines for Irish Embassies and Missions on Human Rights Defenders.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	303	The Government is focused on achieving maximum growth in exports, including through the development of new markets, and has committed to progressively implementing the recommendations in the Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015.  Ireland's network of Embassies and Consulates continues to work to restore Ireland's international reputation and support export-led growth. This network can play an invaluable role in facilitating trade and building linkages worldwide, and the promotion of Ireland's economic interests overseas has always been a key focus of my Department.My Department's role in this regard has been enhanced following the transfer of certain responsibilities relating to Trade Promotion. I stressed to our Ambassadors yesterday, at the Ambassadors Conference which is currently under way, that this enhanced role should provide a renewed emphasis for their economic work, and will facilitate a stronger relationship across all Departments and Agencies responsible for supporting export growth.My Department and the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will work closely together in planning for trade missions. It is envisaged that these missions will include visits to high-growth developing markets, as well as to other identified priority markets. I believe that these missions, as well as the Joint Economic Commissions with a number of countries, which will now be managed by my Department, will promote the expansion of our trade links.  Export-led growth will be crucial for Ireland in emerging from our current economic difficulties. Our Ambassadors and the staff in the Embassy network are fully aware of the priority which is accorded to trade promotion by the Government.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	304	The Emigrant Support Programme, administered by my Department, provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish . The strong emphasis of the Programme is on supporting culturally sensitive, frontline welfare services, which are targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities, including the elderly and homeless.    These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish people living abroad, particularly in Britain and the United States, through reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local, statutory entitlements.Since 2004, approximately €58 million has been awarded to support Irish organisations in Britain. Last year alone, some 128 British-based organisations received over €8.1 million under the Emigrant Support Programme.  Fourteen of the British-based organisations funded under this programme deal specifically with Irish citizens affected by homelessness and received funding of €857,000 in 2010.  In addition, many other Irish welfare organisations receive significant funding for projects of benefit to homeless Irish persons.My Department, in consultation with the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee, is currently assessing applications for funding under the 2011 grant round for projects based in Britain and organisations will be notified of the outcome in July.  Despite the difficult budgetary situation facing the country, I am determined to maintain a significant level of funding for frontline services in Britain and elsewhere that address the needs of our most vulnerable emigrants.While it is not within my remit to provide direct incentives to Irish emigrants to return to Ireland, the Emigrant Support Programme supports a number of Irish-based organisations that provide assistance to returning elderly and vulnerable Irish emigrants.  These include Safe Home and Crosscare which received €255,000 and €161,140 respectively under the programme in 2010.  A full list of all organisations funded through the Emigrant Support Programme since 2006 is available on www.dfa.ie.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 25, 26 and 50 together.This year marks thirty years of the global AIDS epidemic. Addressing HIV and AIDS, which has destroyed the lives of millions of men, women and children, is of fundamental importance to the reduction of global poverty. AIDS remains a leading cause of death in many developing countries.  Over 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV.At the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS in New York next week, Ireland will urge the UN to continue to lead efforts to ensure that resources are spent effectively.  This means an end to the duplication of effort, a strengthening of co-ordination on the ground, a trustworthy system of monitoring and evaluation and a single-minded focus by all on achieving results.  We will urge all global partners to work closely with national Governments and local and international NGOs to strengthen national responses to HIV and ensure that limited resources reach as many people in need as possible. This will maximise value for money in health, HIV and nutrition programmes.Since women are most affected by the HIV pandemic, and since they are also traditionally responsible for food security in the household, Ireland is calling for increased attention to protecting women. Women are already suffering disproportionately during the current food, fuel and climate crises. These issues lie at the heart of the Irish response.Global financial commitment to fighting HIV and AIDS has increased steadily from about one billion US dollars in 2000 to an estimated 16 billion dollars in 2011. This is an enormous increase.  Recent data from the UNAIDS World Report shows that international efforts are succeeding and that global HIV infection and death rates are now declining.  Ireland's financial commitment to support the fight against HIV and AIDS is being maintained despite the hugely challenging economic difficulties we are currently facing. This year we estimate that we will spend approximately €100 million on HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases as pledged at the UN General Assembly.  Since 2006 we have expended approximately €695 million addressing HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases. I am making a table available with this reply which outlines the division of expenditure.As the HIV and AIDS pandemic has progressed, our aid programme, Irish Aid, has consolidated and streamlined our efforts by focussing and prioritising more and ensuring that we achieve maximum value for money. It has also exploited opportunities to create connections with other priorities such as addressing hunger and under-nutrition.  We use a mix of aid delivery channels for our assistance — including support directly to International Organisations, NGOs and governments. Although we advocate for increased focus on effective prevention in a comprehensive and balanced programme, it is not possible to accurately estimate the relative share that goes to prevention, treatment, care and support respectively as all these aspects are inter-connected and inter-dependent.Children affected by HIV and AIDS remain an explicit priority for Irish Aid. Ireland recognises that a supportive environment is crucial in this regard, with a focus on the household and culturally appropriate social protection networks. School and education protect children from HIV — and education for all, another explicit policy priority for Irish Aid, is thus an essential element of a comprehensive response to HIV prevention.Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is a proven cost-effective intervention strongly supported by Ireland through UN organisations, the Global Fund and the Clinton Foundation, as is follow-up care and treatment if required.  Adequate nutrition for mothers with HIV is crucial not only for birth outcomes, but also to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV. To this effect, Ireland is the first country to support a programme in Mozambique with €1.2 million to improve nutrition for pregnant and lactating women with HIV.  Investments benefiting children well exceed 20% of total Government spend on HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases.AIDS remains a leading cause of death in Africa.   Progress has been made but much remains to be done.  Ireland is playing its part. For Ireland addressing HIV/AIDS is fundamental to our stated aim of poverty reduction and human development.Over the last 20 years the international community has come together to fight HIV and AIDS. It has been a long and difficult road and now many indicators of success are becoming apparent. There are more funds flowing into Africa to fight the epidemic than ever before. Coordination and focus is much improved. Treatment is now at 40% which is up from 1% only 10 years ago. Much remains to be done but we are on the right road and Ireland will continue to play its part.Summary of Expenditure — Health HIV and Aids and communicable diseases through various funding channels.Figures in € million20102009200820072006

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	306	On 11 and 12 March I visited Budapest to attend an informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers. I visited New York for St. Patrick's Day events before travelling on to Washington D.C. for a bilateral meeting with the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. In New York I addressed the Ireland-US Council and met with U.S. based Irish business networks.  I also attended a Bank of America — Enterprise Ireland Technology Innovation event in which Irish high-tech companies met with some of the leading technology companies in the US. I attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 12 April and visited London at the start of May where I met with the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Foreign Secretary William Hague, as well as a number of key Enterprise Ireland clients.On 13 May, I visited Oslo and had discussions with the Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, and a separate meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jonas Gahr Støre. More recently, I attended an OECD meeting in Paris last week and took the opportunity to meet with the French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, as well as my counterparts from Australia and New Zealand, and to speak with them on economic matters.While exports to some of our historic trade partners continue to perform well, in an era where developing countries are seeing extraordinary growth, as a small open economy we must seek to diversify wherever possible. The BRIC countries, together with a number of countries in East Asia, Africa and the Gulf, have been identified as priority markets for Ireland's exports. These are high growth economies with rapidly growing middle classes where there is potential for increased trade and investment. Export industries identified as having the best potential for increasing economic growth and spurring job creation in Ireland include the cleantech, software, life-sciences and agri-food sectors. Food and drink exports, for example, rose by 11% in 2010, and as societies in Asia become richer and their food preferences change, there is clearly much potential for further growth.The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation continues to have lead responsibility for trade policy, which includes the promotion of Ireland's trade interests in the context of the EU Common Commercial Policy and the WTO. That Department represents Ireland on a number of EU committees which discuss both tariff and non tariff barriers in the context of ongoing EU Free Trade negotiations. The EU's Market Access Advisory Committee seeks to address non-tariff barriers in key international markets which vary across markets.My Department and the Embassy network co-operates closely with other Departments and State Agencies in overcoming barriers to trade and in assisting companies with knowledge of the local commercial environment in markets where they are present.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 23 and 33 together.I am very concerned about the reports of detention, torture, intimidation and trials of medical professionals in Bahrain, some of whom are Irish-trained, for simply meeting their professional and ethical obligation to attend to those seriously injured in the recent violent clampdown against peaceful protestors. I understand that 47 doctors and nurses who tried to help those critically injured during the protests will be tried in a military court on charges of acting against the state. I am also troubled by the broader human rights situation in Bahrain, particularly the death penalty sentences recently handed down to four protestors.The Government's position on this is clear. We condemn all repressive actions by the Bahrain authorities during and after the recent protests, including those taken against medical staff following their professional obligations. We wish to see all reported serious violations of human rights credibly investigated, the immediate release, unless charged, of detained peaceful protestors and medical professionals who assisted the injured, access for independent observers to the ongoing legal proceedings, and a process of inclusive dialogue aimed at agreeing necessary political and economic reforms.It is regrettable that, months after the protests began, the Bahraini government has yet to initiate any meaningful process of dialogue with the protestors. As I have stated previously, genuine dialogue and reform is crucial if Bahrain is to emerge from its current difficulties. I do welcome the announced intention by King Hamad to lift the state of emergency and hope that this takes place in accordance with the timetable set. I also welcome the King's announcement that a national dialogue, without preconditions, will commence on 1 July and hope this call is fully supported and acted upon by all in Bahrain.   Similar views are shared by many of our EU Partners and Ireland has been active in encouraging a clear articulation by the EU of its serious concern.The EU formally raised the human rights situation, including the repressive actions taken against medical staff in Bahrain, with the Bahraini authorities in Manama on 15 May. Furthermore, the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 23 May discussed the situation in Bahrain and adopted strong Conclusions, which I fully support, calling for the fair and transparent administration of justice and access for independent observers to ongoing legal proceedings including in cases involving charges against medical professionals. The Council underlined the need for Bahrain to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and its accountability regarding allegations of human rights violations including reported cases of torture and ill-treatment.I would strongly urge the Bahraini government to pursue a different path and to allow its citizens to peacefully express grievances, start a genuine dialogue and implement political reforms. The positive examples of Tunisia and Egypt have demonstrated how receptive citizens can be when their genuine grievances are listened to and acted upon. I note that these grievances are not only felt by many of the majority Shia but also by some of the Sunni community who wish to have more political freedom and economic opportunities.In relation to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, its provision of overseas educational services on a commercial basis, including in Bahrain, is primarily an operational issue for the RCSI. In this regard, the relationship between the RCSI and the Government of Bahrain would be very much a matter for those parties themselves.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I am considering the question of Ireland's ratification of the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement and will discuss the matter with my Government colleagues in the normal manner before proceeding.  As regards an invitation to Mr Brammertz to address members of the Dáil, such an invitation would be a matter for the House.The EU's Stabilisation and Association Process represents the first step in helping the countries in the region move towards eventual membership.  Each country's progress towards the EU depends on its individual efforts to comply with the criteria for EU accession, and on the fulfilment of agreed political and economic criteria under the Stabilisation and Association Process.  Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is a key condition of Stabilisation and Association Process.  The requirement for full cooperation with the ICTY is included in the text of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia under Articles 2 and 4.Cooperation with the ICTY by the governments in the region is an essential part of the process of securing long term peace and stability in the Western Balkans.  Ireland and its EU partners have consistently urged the Serbian Government to take all the necessary measures to apprehend the ICTY indictees.In this context, I welcome the arrest on 26 May of Ratko Mladic and his transfer to the Tribunal in The Hague on 31 May.  I want to pay tribute to the efforts of President Tadic and the Serbian Government in securing the arrest of Mladic.  His arrest represents another important step in addressing the appalling atrocities committed during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s.  His trial at the ICTY in The Hague can help further the cause of true reconciliation in the Western Balkans region.

I would be guided in the first instance in this by the assessment of the Spanish authorities.  The Spanish Government continues to underline the necessity for ETA to abandon its arms and declare its own dissolution as a terrorist organisation.  In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question, I note that it is ultimately a matter for the Spanish courts to determine the eligibility of any given political party or organisation to contest elections.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Spanish Constitutional court made a ruling prior to the recent local and regional elections in Spain permitting the participation in the elections of Bildu, a new political formation in the Basque Country.

The Taoiseach and I discussed the question of Irish immigration with President Obama when we met with him on 23 May in Dublin.  Responding to our concerns, the President expressed his interest in achieving progress on immigration issues.I also discussed the issue of Irish immigration with Secretary of State Clinton during our meeting on 18 March and with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Centres in New York on 16 March. The Taoiseach raised the issue of the undocumented and the potential for the continued development of Ireland's migration arrangements with the US with President Obama during his St Patrick's Day visit to Washington. The Taoiseach also met with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform on 5 May when in New York.  Acting on my behalf, the Embassy of Ireland in Washington continues to engage with leaders in Congress, from both parties, on an ongoing basis. I look forward to meeting with Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow and raising these issues with him.I am encouraged by President Obama's continued commitment to addressing the question of immigration reform. Speaking on 10 May, the President, in an address dedicated to the issue of immigration, reiterated his call for comprehensive reform of the system, and particularly called for the passage of the DREAM Act. Under the DREAM Act qualifying undocumented young people seeking to go to college or join the US military, and who were brought illegally to the US as children, would be eligible to seek regularisation of their status.I am very aware of the difficult situation facing those who are undocumented and living in the USA, as well as the distress caused to families in both Ireland and the US. The most realistic long term solution for our undocumented citizens remains through comprehensive immigration reform.  The inclusion of Ireland in an amended reciprocal E3 visa scheme, which would allow Irish people with a certain level of education to work in the US on a two year renewable visa, is the most effective way of creating new opportunities for Irish citizens in the USA. The introduction of such a scheme, which has attracted support from a number of members of Congress from both parties, will require the passage of legislation in Congress.The successful passage of E3 visa legislation would strengthen the human bridge between the two countries, which underpins our excellent existing bilateral relations, and provide a mechanism for Irish nationals seeking to work in the USA in the future. We continue to press for such a scheme, including with members of Congress. It is the case, however, that the E3 would not provide a solution to the undocumented Irish in the US.I am very aware of the enormous political challenges that face efforts to pass any immigration related legislations at the current time, including the E3 proposal.  I and my Department, and particularly the Embassy in Washington, will continue to work very actively on the issue with the US Administration, Congressional leaders and Irish immigration reform advocates.

My Department manages a significant development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, which is strongly focused on sub-Saharan Africa.  Our broader relations with Africa are managed through our Embassy network across that continent, as well as through our relationships with the European Union, the United Nations, and other international bodies.While development needs remain very evident, Africa is also undergoing major political, economic and social change, and it is important that we consider ways of strengthening our approach to Africa in order to respond to these changes. Against this background officials in my Department have been examining ways to strengthen all aspects of our relations with our African partners in the political, economic, and development spheres.Trade, investment and business-to-business exchange are increasingly important emerging facets of our relationship with Africa, and we will be sharpening our focus on identifying opportunities in these areas.  Some practical work has already been done in this area in terms of staff training and enhancing the capacity of our Embassies in Africa to undertake economic and trade work.  The enhanced role for my Department in the trade area will also facilitate greater coherence in this regard in Africa. A broad review of our relations with Africa, and options for strengthening these, is at an advanced stage in my Department, and I envisage that we will be making a more detailed statement and publishing our plan in this regard in the near future.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	312	There has been no change in Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality, which has been pursued by successive Governments, and which is characterised by non-participation in military alliances.  Ireland has made overflight and landing facilities at Shannon Airport available to the United States for well over 50 years.  There is no incompatibility between these arrangements and our traditional policy of military neutrality.  The current arrangements are fully consistent with Ireland's obligations under successive Resolutions of the UN Security Council.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 35 together.Over thirty years ago, Ireland was the first EU Member State to declare that the resolution of the Palestinian issue must involve the establishment of a Palestinian state. That is now the policy of the EU and of the international community. I share the commitment of successive Irish Governments to this policy and will continue to work, both nationally and at EU level, towards its realisation. There should be a State of Palestine, and very soon.  A number of countries, principally in Latin America and including Brazil, Argentina and Chile, have in recent months decided to formally recognise a Palestinian state. This is in addition to those states — mostly in Africa or in the Islamic world — which have recognised Palestine for many years.If the peace process remains stalled, it is widely expected that the Palestinians may in September seek recognition at the United Nations for a Palestinian State. They have made it clear, however, that this would be a last resort, and their preferred option would be the resumption of direct negotiations with Israel, to achieve the State of Palestine through a comprehensive peace agreement.  Ireland supports the resumption of negotiations to achieve a comprehensive peace, leading to a two state solution of Israel and a State of Palestine, based on the 1967 borders with any mutually agreed exchanges, living side by side in peace and sharing Jerusalem as their capital, as set out consistently by the EU Foreign Affairs Council. Ireland's position, and that of the EU, on the illegality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and our support for the 2004 ICJ ruling on the separation wall, are equally well known. We fully support the exhortations of President Obama to the parties to re-engage and work to reach agreement.The Palestinian leadership has yet to decide whether it will seek recognition in some form for a Palestinian State at the United Nations next autumn. While it is working towards the declaration of a State in the near future, it has not yet issued such a declaration. It will, of course, have to weigh the timing of such a move, taking into account the risk of adverse reactions on the ground.If the issue of recognition arises at the United Nations in the autumn, the Government will consider Ireland's response very carefully. We will take into account factors such as Ireland's long-standing support for the achievement of a Palestinian State, the exact terms and nature of what may be proposed, the positions of EU partners and other friends, the progress on the wider peace process, and our assessment of the practical impact of any such decision.  I very much hope to be able to extend Irish recognition of an actual, functioning Palestinian state during my time in office.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	314	At its meeting on 12 April 2011, the Foreign Affairs Council decided that "it shall, if requested by UN OCHA, conduct a CSDP operation "EUFOR Libya" to support humanitarian assistance in the region, in full respect of the principles governing humanitarian action, particularly impartiality and neutrality".   The EU is currently undertaking the necessary planning to allow it to react quickly in the event of a request for assistance from UN OCHA.  At present, there seems little likelihood that such a request will be forthcoming from the UN, and a further Council decision would be required before any operation could be launched.The April decision was taken in accordance with Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union which provides that decisions having military or defence implications shall be taken by the Council acting unanimously.  The same requirement would apply to any decision to launch an operation.  There are no plans to deploy the battlegroup in this regard.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Ireland's Embassy to the United Arab Emirates opened in October 2009.  The Embassy also has secondary accreditation to Qatar and Kuwait.  One of the principal reasons for opening the Embassy was to support Irish businesses in the UAE and in the Gulf region more generally, and to facilitate trade and investment in both directions.  Currently, there are more than 40 Irish companies with operations in the UAE and many more exporting goods and services to the Emirates.  Ministerial visits took place in January and April of this year and, in both instances, Embassy contacts facilitated significant meetings with Government and business interlocutors.Since opening, the Embassy has supported individual companies, groups of companies in particular sectors and the Irish business organisations in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  In this work, the Embassy works in close cooperation with Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and other State Agencies.  While significant results can only be delivered over time, through building long-term relationships, the impact of the Embassy can already be seen in some immediate results since it opened including:introductions for Irish companies to major state entities in the UAE;the placement of hundreds of UAE students in English-language courses in Ireland in summer 2010 and summer 2011;supporting the establishment of the Dubai Irish Business Network in the first-half of 2010;the signature of Double Taxation Agreement in 2010;the lifting of the ban on the import of Irish beef in November 2009;In terms of social impact, the Embassy provides consular support and services to the growing Irish community in the Emirates (currently 4,500), the largest in the Gulf region. With the opening of the Embassy, these citizens can now access locally in the UAE those services for which previously they would have had to deal with the Embassy in Riyadh.  The Embassy also works with and supports the activities of the various Irish societies and GAA clubs in the UAE.Cultural events supported by my Department and the Embassy have also had an impact.  These include a Samuel Beckett Exhibition in 2010 and, in 2011, a series of concerts by the National Youth Orchestra of Ireland, Míceál Ó Súilleabháin and Liam O'Flynn.  In the overall foreign policy context, the opening of an Embassy in the UAE is a step toward developing stronger relations with an important Middle-East partner.  It is worth noting that the UAE have reciprocated the Government's decision and opened an Embassy in Dublin.

A Political Declaration on the renewal of our bilateral co-operation was signed on 1 March 2010 and discussions are ongoing to give effect to that Declaration, including as appropriate through the conclusion of a bilateral cooperation agreement.  A further round of political consultations at official level will be held in Dublin in the coming weeks.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 48 together.The founders of the European Union of today set out to create a peaceful, prosperous and united Europe.  The Union today remains, despite the challenges we face, both prosperous and peaceful and embraces twenty-seven Member States stretching from the Atlantic to the Black Sea.  The development of the European Union has frequently been marked by periods of tension between, on the one hand, the process of a degree of pooling of sovereignty and intensified cooperation and, on the other, increased reliance on the nation state and its protection. Not surprisingly, this tension sometimes appears stronger at times of economic difficulty.I do not, however, share the Deputy's belief that cooperation has been notably lacking in the current economic stress.  The European Council of late March adopted a comprehensive package of measures to address various aspects of the preservation of the euro's stability and to promote a return to growth and job creation.  This was the culmination of many months' work, carried out with urgency and in the spirit of cooperation and compromise.  Taking the case of Ireland, it is clear that we have benefitted from the solidarity of our EU partners during the current economic crisis, though the loan provisions from the EFSM and EFSF.  While there are aspects of those loans which can be bettered — a matter we are pursuing in line with conclusions of the Eurogroup — I am certain that our present difficult situation would be much worse without the continuing support of our EU partners.We and our fellow member states of the European Union recently committed ourselves again to the ideals of the Union's founding fathers when we ratified the Lisbon Treaty.  In this, we solemnly and explicitly recalled the historic importance of the ending of the division of the European continent, undertook together to promote economic and social progress of our peoples and resolved to continue the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe.The European Union is in many ways a work in progress.  We should not diminish what we have achieved together so far.  In fact, every time the European Union has confronted a challenge over the past sixty years, we have always overcome it stronger and more united.  We have secured the rights and freedoms of our citizens; we have built together the world's biggest economic power and the largest market; we have established and, despite unprecedented pressures, successfully defended a single currency; and, after centuries of conflict, have given peace and stability to the continent through enlargement of the Union.  I am confident that my EU colleagues remain as committed as I am to the ideals which motivated the founders of the European Union.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	318	Ireland is committed to safeguarding the rights of all citizens across the European Union and deplores violence or the threat of violence against any groups or citizens. As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland actively supports the promotion and protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. This has been particularly evidenced through our engagement with other EU Member States on LGBT issues at the United Nations, in particularly at the Human Rights Council. For a further elaboration of Ireland's recent activities in this respect, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of Thursday, 2 June 2011 to Oral PQ 13732/11, posed by your party colleague, Deputy Martin Ferris.Ireland will continue to support the rights of, and express solidarity with, LGBT communities through our missions abroad, however I understand that the Deputy has expressed an interest in three specific states; Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.HungaryRegrettably some previous LGBT Pride parades in Budapest, in particular those held in 2007 and 2008, were marred by the presence of elements intent on intimidating the participants, both verbally and physically.  The right of pride marchers to enjoy the parade without fear is strongly supported by many like-minded Embassies in Budapest; on the occasion of last year's parade, Ireland joined with other Embassies in issuing a statement expressing solidarity with LGBT communities in Hungary. Referring to the violence which had been directed against events in previous years, the Embassies supported the right of these communities to march. I very much welcome the fact that last year's parade passed without major incident and am pleased to note that difficulties over this year's parade route have now been resolved.  I hope that Budapest's 16th  Pride festival (culminating in a parade on 18 June) can take place in an equally peaceful atmosphere.  Our Embassy in Budapest will again associate itself with any joint statement issued in advance of the parade.SlovakiaThe first gay pride parade in Bratislava took place in May 2010 but was regrettably disrupted by protestors who attacked participants. The Irish Ambassador attended last year's parade as an act of solidarity with the marchers. The Irish Embassy also participated in a joint statement issued by a number of Embassies in Bratislava expressing support for the LGBT community in Slovakia. This year's Pride parade will take place on 4   June. The Embassy will again join with like-minded Embassies in issuing a statement of support for the event. I hope that the regrettable scenes of last year can be avoided.RomaniaIn Romania, GayFest, the annual LGBT Pride festival of Bucharest (which first took place in 2004) receives funding from the Romanian Ministry of Health and the National Council for Combating Discrimination. This year a gay pride parade will take place in Bucharest on 4 June. The Irish Embassy joined other like-minded Embassies in Bucharest in expressing support for the event. The parades have not been without opposition in the past and they have been the subject of unsuccessful court challenges and counter-demonstrations by far-right groups which have previously descended into violence.  However, the 2010 and 2009 parades passed off largely without violent incident and I would hope to see this year's event take place in a peaceful and supportive atmosphere.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Since the first introduction of the anti-homosexuality legislation as a private member's bill in 2009, Ireland, together with its EU partners and civil society organisations in Uganda, has been very active in highlighting the human rights implications of the draft anti-homosexuality bill and expressing strong opposition to the adoption of this bill.  Ireland has been particularly vocal in pointing out the inconsistencies between this draft legislation and Uganda's domestic and international human rights obligations.Irish representatives have met with several senior members of the Ugandan Government, including the Prime Minister, to discuss the draft bill.  It was raised with the Ugandan Foreign Minister during a visit by my predecessor to Uganda last year.  In addition, Ireland's Ambassador to Uganda has met directly with Mr. David Bahati M.P., who is the sponsor of the Bill, to articulate the Government's position, and to make clear that adherence to international human rights standards is the foundation of Ireland's relationship with Uganda.The current situation is that the previous session of Parliament concluded without the bill being passed.  If the bill is to be placed on the agenda of the new parliament it will have to go through full parliamentary process again.  Repeated assurances have been given at the highest levels of the Ugandan Government that the bill, should it be placed before Parliament for a vote, will not pass.  Our Embassy in Uganda will continue to monitor the situation closely.  If a new bill is proposed, Ireland will again join with EU and other partners in expressing opposition, at the highest level, to its adoption.In the broader work of promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons internationally, on 22 March 2011 at the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council, Ireland actively supported a Joint Statement on behalf of 85 countries from every continent, including five African States, entitled ‘Ending acts of violence and related human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity'.  We were one of fifteen EU member States who were part of a cross regional core group which worked to prepare the statement in Geneva.  The Joint Statement demonstrates the increasing commitment across the international community to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity.  The Statement called on States to end acts of violence, criminal sanctions and related human rights violations committed against individuals because of their sexual orientation or gender identityThe Joint Statement builds on a December 2008 United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Statement on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, which was supported by 68 countries including Ireland and all EU Member States.  In June 2010, the European Union Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM) adopted a ‘Toolkit to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) People'.  Ireland participated fully in the elaboration of this comprehensive toolkit which guides the work of all European Union (EU) diplomats, including Irish, in overseas missions.

The recommendations of the Forum contributed to the implementation of a series of significant initiatives across a range of areas, including: tourism; the promotion of Irish culture abroad; diaspora engagement; innovation; and business network development.  The report of the first Forum together with the two subsequent progress reports are available on my Department's website —www.dfa.ie.In the context of preparing for the 2011 Forum, a comprehensive review of all the recommendations from the 2009 Forum has been undertaken by my Department, in consultation with all relevant Government Departments.  A copy of this review will be forwarded to the Deputy and will be made available on my Department's website.  The report outlines areas of significant progress made both by the Government and the private sector on a number of initiatives which emerged from, or were discussed, at the Forum.The decision by the Government to proceed with a second Forum on 7 and 8 October will provide an opportunity for us to meet directly with many of the most influential members of our Diaspora and to discuss our priorities for economic renewal, job creation and the restoration of Ireland's reputation abroad.  I look forward to welcoming the participants to Dublin for a frank and intensive exchange of ideas and to enhancing our engagement with them in the coming years as we work towards economic recovery.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	321	Colombia has witnessed the longest period of upheaval of any country in Latin America — over 50 years in all. Approximately 10% of the population has been internally displaced over the past number of years, a number second only to that of Sudan.  The degree of lawlessness that arises from the absence of peace presents a major challenge to any government.  The effects of terrorism and narco-trafficking have blighted the lives of many innocent people.However, compared with the situation ten years ago, Colombia today has become a safer place to live. Colombians' belief in the prospects for a peaceful future, and the impressive recent social and economic development reflected in strong inward investment flows, reinforce the impression that the country is slowly emerging from a grim past.  In order to succeed, the peace process in Colombia must tackle the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict.  Our approach, and that of the European Union and the UN and the Organisation of American States (OAS), the regional body that is most directly involved in the peace process, is to assist and influence the Colombian Government in a manner that results in economic and social development while progressively improving human rights standards.The Government of Colombia has repeatedly stated its determination to bring an end to violence within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law, passed in 2005, which provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society.  The Irish Government has given both moral and financial support to the implementation of the Justice and Peace Laws. I am encouraged by the passing in the Colombian Congress this month of the Victims Law and Land Restitution Law, which advances the procedures of allowing claims of displaced persons to file claims for the return of their land.The Government will continue to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.  We are fully supportive of efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Colombia, and will continue to support the Government of Colombia in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict.  We are continuing our support for the OAS and IACHR in the implementation of the peace process.

It normally takes 10 working days.  During the peak summer period, application processing times for this service can lengthen and the processing period for ordinary post applications is currently six weeks or longer.Passport demand in general is currently running at a level 13% higher than the same period in earlier years.  At present the Passport Service is receiving an average of 4,260 applications per day.  This is an unprecedented level of demand, with the number of applications received from Irish residents alone in four recent days at over 5,200, exceeding by 700 the highest number previously for any one single day.The system is also coping with an unprecedented demand for passports at short notice, with some 350 people per day coming to the public office seeking passports within a period of less than 10 days.  To protect the integrity of the system and the quality of the passport, the Passport Service cannot provide standard passports within a single day.  The shortest turnaround time available is three working days for applications received over the public counter accompanied by proof of travel, other than in cases of genuine emergency.  The Passport Service, through seasonal overtime and the additional output provided by recruited temporary staff, is working to bring processing times back to normal levels at the earliest opportunity.There has been some media commentary on the scale of the delays and some of this has been inaccurate.  Whereas the delay of three working days in processing passport express applications is regretted, it is three working days and not the many weeks suggested by some media commentators.  Passport express applications are still being produced within 13 working days maximum.  Equally, over 70% of applications submitted on the island come through the express services and accordingly the number of citizens experiencing weeks of delay has also been overstated in places.We would strongly appeal to the public to assist the Passport Service by checking the validity of their passports before making bookings to travel abroad.  A valid passport should be the first item on any check list when considering foreign travel.

There are three main components of our early efforts to establish lines of communication with partners and to re-engage constructively with the European agenda: members of the Government are availing of opportunities to meet their EU colleagues and with representatives of the European institutions; our Embassy network has been actively engaging with partners in EU capitals; and  we are keeping EU diplomatic representatives in Dublin fully briefed on our policies and actions through regular contacts.Since taking office, I have met my European colleagues on a number of occasions at EU and other Ministerial meetings.  In addition, I travelled to London to meet Deputy Prime Minister Clegg and Secretary of State Hague.  During the Queen's visit I had the opportunity of further meetings with Secretary of State Hague.  Meanwhile Minister of State Creighton has had discussions with her British counterpart David Lidington, the Minister for Europe, in London and in Brussels.   The Taoiseach has travelled to London to meet Prime Minister Cameron and met with him again in Dublin, at a meeting which I also attended, on the occasion of the recent State Visit.I travelled to Paris in May where, in addition to attending the OECD Ministerial Council, I had a separate bilateral meeting with my French counterpart Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé.  I have also had bilateral meetings with my Finnish and Luxembourg colleagues in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council.  Minister of State Creighton has availed of visits to Brussels and Luxembourg to meet representatives of the institutions (Pierre de Boissieu, Secretary General of the Council; Catherine Day, Secretary General of the Commission; Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn; Commissioner Šefcovic, Jerzy Buzek, President of the European Parliament; Joseph Daul, leader of the EPP Group; Klaus Welle, Secretary General of the European Parliament) as well as her Polish, Bulgarian, Slovak and Greek counterparts.  She also travelled to Paris and Berlin from 10-13 May for bilateral consultations with her French and German counterparts.The Irish Embassy network has the responsibility for transmitting the Government's economic message, and the context for it, to key decision-makers in the EU and beyond; at the same time our missions keep us informed of on the views and policies of partners.  To ensure that our diplomatic representatives are fully briefed on the Government's approach to delivering national recovery and can play their part in this task, I have called a conference of all Irish Ambassadors which is taking place this week, on 1 and 2 June in Dublin.  In line with the commitment we gave on taking office, this conference places special emphasises on economic issues and the need to promote Ireland as country to business in.  The conference was organised in conjunction with the main State Agencies in the economic and trade promotion sector and has involved key representatives of the Irish export sector.As regards activity here in Dublin, I invited EU Heads of Mission in Dublin to attend a briefing on the Government's approach in Iveagh House on 19 April.  All 24 resident embassies were represented, as well as the heads of the European Commission and European Parliament offices here.  I set out the Government's analysis of Ireland's economic situation and used the occasion to underline the wish of the Government to engage constructively and more widely on the range of issues on the European agenda.  Our efforts to engage with our European partners will intensify in the coming months.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	324	Enlargement continues to be an important aspect of the Union's external relations, which plays a role in promoting democracy, stability and prosperity in prospective candidate countries. There are currently three candidate countries negotiating accession to the EU: Croatia, Turkey and Iceland.  There are two further countries which are officially candidates but have yet to open negotiations: Macedonia and Montenegro.Accession negotiations with Croatia are nearing completion. Croatia's accession process was discussed at the General Affairs Council on 23 May, attended by Minister of State Creighton. The discussion was informal and focussed on the remaining negotiation Chapters that have to be concluded. Croatia has made substantial progress in the last twelve months. While there are some outstanding issues still to be resolved, particularly in the area of Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, I would expect negotiations to be concluded in the coming months with a draft Treaty ready for signature possibly before the end of the year. The European Council in June is expected to consider Croatia's accession process.Progress in the case of Turkey remains slow. A complicating factor has been parliamentary elections, due to take place this month, which necessitated the resignation of prospective candidates from their government positions in advance of the poll. I am hopeful that once the elections are concluded we will see a renewed effort by the Turkish government to fulfil benchmarks that would allow for the opening of further negotiation chapters. However, until Turkey fulfils its obligations regarding the Ankara Protocol and makes progress towards normalising its bilateral relations with Cyprus, the eight negotiation Chapters suspended in 2006 will remain so.Accession negotiations with Iceland were opened last July and actual negotiations will begin following the Commission Screening Reports on each chapter, which report on areas of difference between Icelandic and EU law. It is expected that up to five negotiation chapters will be opened at the Intergovernmental Conference with Iceland on 27 June. The overall level of Iceland's preparedness to meet EU legislative requirements is good, with Iceland being already part of the European Economic Area and Schengen, and prompt progress in negotiations is expected in many areas.The opening of negotiations with Macedonia remains blocked by Greece due to the name issue. There can be no progress until a solution is found and diplomatic efforts continue to try to resolve the impasse. Montenegro, granted candidate status last December, has still to comply with some outstanding issues identified by the Commission before negotiations can be opened. The Commission will report on progress in this regard in autumn this year.Question No. 45 answered with Question No. 20.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Unfortunately, no part of the world is totally free from human rights abuses. Ireland, both bilaterally and in association with the European Union and other like-minded partners, makes frequent and numerous interventions with regard to human rights concerns in the countries which have the most serious human rights abuses.  Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including official channels, reports of the United Nations human rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, reports of Independent Experts and Special Rapporteurs appointed by the United Nations and international and Irish non-governmental and civil society organisations.Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council.  The 17th Session of the UN Human Rights Council is currently taking place in Geneva.  Ireland is playing an active role in negotiating draft resolutions on Belarus, Sri Lanka and Libya.We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses, including supporting the role of UN Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.  At these UN bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in a number of countries.  Ireland is fully associated with these statements.  The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries, as circumstances require.Ireland has engaged proactively with the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review mechanism since its creation in March 2006.  At the latest session of the UPR, which took place in Geneva, from 2-13 May 2011, Ireland made a number of interventions, raising issues such as gender based violence, women's rights, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of movement and the protection of human rights defenders within the States under review.  Ireland asked questions of or made recommendations to Latvia, Samoa, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somalia, Solomon Islands, Sudan and Papua New Guinea.  Member States are expected to report to the Human Rights Council on their follow up to their examination under the Universal Periodic Review process, including whether or not they have implemented their UPR recommendations.The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.Together with our EU partners, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  The Court's Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.The risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak.  Development is essential to allow people the full enjoyment of their human rights, and this is a key concern for Ireland's development co-operation programme.  Irish Aid supports specific actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions, in particular through legal training.  Support is also provided for legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses.  Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Ireland, together with our EU partners, is committed to enhancing stability in the Western Balkans region.  The EU perspective for the countries in the region, agreed at the June 2003 Thessaloniki European Council, is essential in helping to build and maintain this stability.  The EU will remain engaged in assisting the countries in the region to undertake the reforms necessary to move forward in their path to the EU.  While there remain issues of serious concern, and much remains to be achieved at national level, the regional dynamic is more encouraging.Most recently, the arrest on 26 May of former Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic by the Serbian authorities and his transfer to the Tribunal in The Hague on 31 May represented an important step in addressing the appalling atrocities committed during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s.His arrest was preceded by a number of important initiatives by the governments of the region to deal with the legacy of the Balkan Wars.  In March 2010 Serbia's parliament passed a declaration condemning the Srebrenica massacre and apologising to the families of the victims.  In the same month, Bosnia and Herzegovina appointed an Ambassador to Serbia after a three-year hiatus. This was followed by a joint visit by the Serbian and Croatian Presidents to Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 2010 to attend a commemoration to mark the 15th anniversary the Srebrenica massacre.  In November 2010, the Serbian and Croatian Presidents paid a joint visit to Vukovar in Croatia, where the Serbian President laid a wreath to commemorate the victims of the three-month siege in 1991.Over the past two years, the region has also received a boost in its relations with the EU through the extension of a visa waiver scheme for entry to the Schengen Zone to all countries of the Western Balkans, except Kosovo.Following on from a joint EU-Serbia resolution at the UN General Assembly last year, Serbia and Kosovo have been engaged in an EU-facilitated dialogue since March 2011.  The talks are focused on practical matters such as land registry, customs stamps, telecoms and electricity.  It is hoped that the parties will reach agreement on some of these matters soon.Elections took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Albania in the past year, with a general election due to take place in Macedonia shortly.  In all cases, the elections passed off peacefully and marked an improvement on past elections.  However, almost eight months after the elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, government formation has yet to be completed and the political atmosphere remains difficult.  Last month, EU High Representative Ashton achieved a notable success in the EU's efforts to stabilise the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina when she persuaded President Dodik of the Republika Srpska to repeal a planned referendum which could have questioned the state-level judiciary and the international presence in the country.  It is important that this agreement is fulfilled.In Kosovo, the Constitutional Court deemed the election of Behgjet Pacolli as President to have breached the constitution, and a consensus candidate, Atifete Jahjaga, was elected Kosovo's first woman president on 7 April.The local elections in Albania on 8 May were closely contested.  The result of the election for mayor of Tirana has yet to be determined.  Controversy over the count has led to demonstrations in the city.Meanwhile, negotiations on Croatian accession to the EU are in the final phase.  Montenegro, which was granted candidate status last December, has still to comply with some outstanding issues identified by the Commission before negotiations can be opened.  The Commission will report on progress in this regard in autumn this year.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 51 together.The Government's aid programme, which is administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, is sharply focused on efforts to eliminate extreme poverty and hunger.  In its most recent peer review of the programme, in 2009, the OECD stated that Irish Aid's concentration in a limited number of poor African countries is one of its main strengths.  The OECD also reported that Ireland has a strong, cutting edge programme, which is a champion in making aid more effective.Seven of the nine priority countries for the aid programme, where we have a commitment to long-term strategic assistance, are in sub-Saharan Africa.  These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.  The other two priority countries, Vietnam and Timor Leste, are in Asia.  All of the programmes in these countries involve a close partnership with Governments and communities with the clear objective of reducing poverty levels, in line with the countries' own priorities.We deliver our aid programme in co-operation with Governments, communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners including the UN and EU.  Irish Aid funding is protected by rigorous external and internal monitoring, accounting and audit controls, which are in place in all countries where we provide development assistance.  The objective is to ensure that funding is directed effectively to those areas most in need and delivered in line with clearly set objectives.The results from our aid programme and from our co-operation with partners in Africa and elsewhere can be demonstrated clearly.  For instance, the measured incidence of extreme poverty is falling in many of our priority countries, as are the prevalence rates of HIV and AIDS.  Primary school enrolment figures are rising very significantly.  In recent years, economic growth in Africa has been impressive despite the difficult economic circumstances globally.  The aid provided by Ireland is making a vital contribution to the reduction of poverty, and the promotion of sustainable economic development in the countries where we work.  We continue to work towards the day when our partner countries in Africa will no longer depend on external aid and can take full control of their own development.The Government is now beginning the process of reviewing the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid to take account of developments over the past five years and to ensure that we maximise the contribution that Ireland can make to the fight against global poverty and hunger.

A reply issued to the Council on 17th May, 2011 indicating that the Office of Public Works is not prepared to approve funding for this application, at this time, as a Feasibility Study is currently under way in relation to the flooding issues in Bandon.  This study will provide the basis on which further decisions will be made in relation to any possible flood relief measures for the town, including dredging of the channel.  The study will be completed later this year.

I am informed that, under an initiative currently in preparation, NAMA will shortly include on its website a database of properties which are under the control of receivers appointed to enforce against NAMA debtors (appointed either directly by NAMA or by participating institutions working on its behalf).  This will provide a single source of information on NAMA assets which are for sale and it will be updated on a very regular basis.  It is expected to be up-and-running within a matter of weeks.Within the context of its commercial remit, NAMA has made it known that it is open to considering proposals aimed at contributing to broader social and economic objectives, including facilitating public bodies and it has committed to giving first option to such bodies on the purchase of property which is within its control and which may be suitable for their purposes.  In these circumstances, NAMA is available to meet with public bodies to discuss any specific proposals that they may have regarding local facilities.

The reduced rate will also apply to all hot take-away food.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, while the measures are contained in the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011, they have already published details of the proposed changes in the publication Rate Change — Jobs Initiative 2011   on their website to provide timely information for business.  The experience of the Revenue Commissioners it that the changes to the point-of-sales systems will be minor and simply involve programme changes to the VAT rate that are effective for sales taking place on or after 1 July 2011.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me that as part of the stress tests, it added two levels of conservatism to the calculated capital requirements thus creating a capital buffer.  This was established to take into consideration the potential capital absorbing impact of certain matters falling outside the parameters of the stress test.  This includes defaults falling outside the stress test period, changes to capital rules that may impact the measure of capital or of risk and changes to funding structures and costs.  Although the stress test was for a defined period there was a need to satisfy the market and the external partners that the capital calculation was convincingly adequate for the longer term.   The buffer capital consisted of €2.3bn additional Tier 1 capital and €3bn of contingent convertible debt.  The latter amount only converts to tier 1 capital in the future if the existing capital reaches a certain trigger level. This latter structure reflects the greater uncertainty associated with this requirement.  This introduces an extra layer of resilience, and recognizes the possible, albeit unlikely emergence of large losses after 2013.The buffer represents a further protective capital layer over and above already conservative provisions which are themselves based on an even more stressed macroeconomic environment than currently prevails.  The decision regarding the capital buffer was taken during the review phase of the stress tests by Central Bank of Ireland in consultation with the external authorities, prior to their finalization in end March 2011.

I therefore have no records of the matter raised in the question. I do understand that there have, from time to time, been discussions about Ireland among various parties.  However, Ireland's engagement in relation to our EU/IMF programme of support has been principally with the IMF and the EU institutions, along with the member states concerned.

The remaining €17½ billion comes from the State's own resources, namely the National Pensions Reserve Fund and other domestic cash sources.    €35 billion of the total €85 billion financial support package was originally set aside for the banking sector with the remaining €50 billion available for the purpose of financing the State.The recent banking stress tests carried out by the Central Bank identified an additional €24 billion in support to the banking sector as being required, including €3 billion of funds which take the form of contingent capital. However, it is anticipated that mitigating actions, such as burdening sharing, will mean that up to €5 billion of this €24 billion will not have to be provided by the State.The budgetary forecasts contained in the recently published Stability Programme Update (SPU) prudently assume that an additional €20 billion in State support to the banking sector will be required. On that basis, therefore, some €15 billion of the funding originally earmarked for the banking sector is now available for use for sovereign purposes, bringing the potential total available for sovereign purposes to €65 billion.  The combined Exchequer deficits for the years 2011-2013 are estimated at €48½ billion in the SPU. Maturing Government debt, both long-term and short-term, over the same period amounts to some €27 billion.It is the stated intention of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to return to sovereign debt markets as soon as market conditions permit.  The steps necessary to enable such a return include resolution of the banking sector issues and continued progress in the reduction of the budget deficit in line with the targets agreed in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, together with the implementation of policies that will see us return to sustainable economic growth.  A key development in that regard has been the publication of the results of the bank stress tests on 31 March 2011 and the associated recapitalisation exercise which have been well received by investors and rating agencies alike.  The NTMA is in constant contact with market participants and will advise me when it feels that the time is right to re-enter the markets.I should say that, based on conservative projections of our funding needs and taking account of funding possibilities, there is no urgency about a return to the markets. Indeed, the purpose of a programme such as the EU/IMF Programme for Ireland is to provide the space necessary for economic and fiscal adjustment to take place. Based on current projections and assuming no market access, the State has access to sufficient funds for its needs into the second half of 2013.

Consumers can confirm whether or not a financial service provider is authorised by checking the Register of Financial Service Providers on the Central Bank's website.   There are also companies offering debt management and debt counselling services which are not registered with or authorised by the Central Bank. In the context of future legislation on financial regulation, I will examine the question of licensing all companies that offer debt management and debt advice services.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I assume that what is being proposed in the details supplied with the Deputy's question is that the amount of the pension levy passed on to individuals over the period of the levy should be available to them as a credit against future income tax liabilities.   The moneys to be raised from the pension fund levy will be used to pay for the reductions in VAT, PRSI and the air travel tax as well as for the additional expenditure measures announced in the Jobs Initiative last month. These and the other various measures in the Initiative represent the first steps by this Government towards improving the competitiveness of important sectors of the economy and facilitating the return to work of people currently unemployed.Given our commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support and the current difficulties in the public finances, the Jobs Initiative must be funded on a cost neutral basis. Since the proceeds of the levy are already committed in the manner I've described, a commitment to allow the levy to also be used as a tax credit against future tax liabilities would mean that the Jobs Initiative would not be cost neutral. I cannot therefore agree to the proposal.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The information reported to the Department of Public Expenditure & Reform indicates that 1,080 civil and public servants availed of the incentivised career break in 2009.   The Government is committed to reducing public service numbers by up to 25,000 by 2015, subject to there being no compulsory redundancies and to the protection of front line services.  The measures necessary to give effect to these reductions are being developed by the Minister for Public Expenditure & Reform, taking account of the existing projections for staff numbers over the coming years and the role of incentivised career breaks will be examined in this context.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	345	The Deputy will be aware that the student grant measures announced in Budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil — Green Party Government began to come into effect from January this year when a reduction of 4% in the rates of grant was applied to all student grant recipients.  Further to this, budget measures that will come into effect from next September for the 2011/12 academic year will change the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres and mature students will no longer have an automatic entitlement to the non-adjacent rate of grant.The Deputy will appreciate that given current economic circumstances I regret that I am not in a position to reverse the changes made to the student grant schemes. As a matter of routine, my Department prepares policy proposals on the student grant schemes each year. For the coming academic year, these will include the budgetary measures I have alluded to already and the annual review of the reckonable income limits contained in the schemes. This year, a more fundamental review is also being undertaken in order to consolidate the four existing student grant schemes into a single unified scheme as part of my Department's overall student grants reform programme.  I expect to be able to publish this scheme shortly.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	346	This Government is committed to supporting the overall thrust of 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, and to the delivery of the goals and targets proposed. As part of this, a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way Irish is taught at primary and second level will be undertaken.   Already, a revised Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012. The revised programme provides for an increase in the proportion of marks available for oral assessment to 40%, and is aimed at promoting a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to review this syllabus in the light of the experiences of students in the first examination.  The priority is to take steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teaching of Irish. When these steps have been implemented, the question of whether Irish should be optional at Leaving Certificate will be considered.

I am anxious to ensure that progress continues to be made in the work on bringing about a reduction in the number of VECs.  The Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) has recently responded to my invitation to it to submit alternative rationalisation proposals, following its expression of concerns regarding the configuration of the proposed new entities.  I will consider the IVEA's response and decide on the particular mergers in the coming period having regard to the potential for savings and to ensuring that the new structures will be fit for purpose.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	348	It is understood that the Deputy's question refers to a proposal for an academy for children with autism which was submitted to my Department for consideration by an organisation in Dublin 13.  My Department will respond to the submitted proposal in the near future.  The Deputy will be aware that my Department has no direct funding arrangements with the group in question.Consideration of this proposal will take account of my Department's policy in this regard, which is focused on ensuring that all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.Reflective of the important role of continuing professional development my Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the Special Education Support Service.  The Deputy will be familiar with the ABA pilot scheme which was funded by my Department for the past decade.  All of the centres which participated in this scheme have been granted recognition as special schools for children with autism.  These schools will operate in line with my Department's policy.  I am pleased to update the Deputy that following their recognition the new schools are currently progressing well in the transitional phase.  Twelve schools have opened and the remaining school is scheduled to open shortly. It is my intention to continue to support this transitional process.The pilot scheme was established in the absence of a network of school-based special classes for children with autism which is now available. The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of this network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 430 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Changes to school transport services were announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.  It is important to stress that there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of the Closed School Rule (CSR).  The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the uniform application of the distance criterion to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR.  This means that children residing less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport. In such cases, these children may apply for concessionary transport.The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date.  This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012, to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.  Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review, indicate that the impact of this change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the CSR are in fact attending their nearest school and will not be affected by this change.Before implementing this second main change which is proposed for 2012, my Department has requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the "on the ground" impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve.  This analysis will be based on the most up to date information available on current school transport usage patterns and I expect to have this information available to me this summer.  I will then have an opportunity to carefully examine the likely affects of this change well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.

All other recognised schools are precluded from charging school fees.  Voluntary contributions by parents of pupils in such recognised schools are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.  The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management, however, their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.

The emphasis in such reviews is on the efficiency and effectiveness of the programmes under examination to assess value for money in their delivery.The Report on this review was published last March and is available on my Department's website.  The review showed that, in 2008, the annual school transport unit cost per primary child was €1,020, €958 per post primary child, €9,087 per special needs child including escort costs and €7,034 excluding escort costs.  The breakdown of pupil costs on a per County basis is not readily available.

The staffing schedule for the 2011-2012 school year was published on my Department's website in March 2011.The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board.  It is open to any Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0019/2011.  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Boards will have been considered.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Late last year agreement was reached between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and unions representing the Community Welfare Officers that the staff of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) would transfer to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011 on a secondment basis initially.  The period of secondment is to last for 9 months until the end of September 2011.  During this period these staff will remain employees of the HSE but are subject to the general direction and control of the Minster for Social Protection.From 1 October 2011 it is intended that the staff of the CWS will be transferred fully to the Department as civil servants and will be accountable to the Minister in the same way as other civil servants.I have been advised that a number of staff in the CWS were employed in a temporary capacity by the HSE in 2010 for a period of six months, including some of the staff in the rent unit in question.  These contracts were subsequently extended to June 2011 from when they are to be gradually withdrawn.In the context of the transfer of functions from the HSE to the Department a number of Transition Managers were appointed from within the Community Welfare Service, to work with the Department of Social Protection to oversee the transfer of the service to the Department.  The relevant Transition Managers are currently in the process of examining the service implications arising from the loss of these temporary staff.

A person in receipt of carer's allowance can engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home for up to 15 hours per week and still qualify for the payment.A qualifying condition for the payment of carer's allowance is that the person receiving care is medically assessed as needing care on a full-time basis.  While carers may work or engage in training or education for up to fifteen hours per week, I have no plans for a further increase in the hours beyond this allowance.  Any further expansion would necessarily dilute the very notion of ‘full time care and attention' and could directly impact on the person who needs that care.When a person's caring responsibilities cease, they may transfer to another payment such as jobseeker's allowance and have their time spent in receipt of carer's allowance counted towards the community employment qualifying period.

These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 24 May 2011 and the appeal will be referred to an Appeals Officer, in due course, who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time of appeals and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department has made a further 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

Notification of the Appeals Officers decision was issued on 09 February 2011.  Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  The legislation also provides that an Appeals Officer may decide a case before him/her on the basis of the documentary evidence.  This course of action was taken in the case of the person concerned as it was considered that an oral hearing was not warranted.Following the submission of additional evidence the Appeals Officer agreed to review the case.  The person concerned will be contacted when the review of her appeal has been finalised.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

The scheme, which applies immediately to turf-cutters on 31 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation, will deliver payments of €1,000 per annum for a maximum of 15 years. As an alternative to financial payments, and where feasible, qualifying turf-cutters will be facilitated in relocating to alternative, non-designated sites to continue cutting turf. The scheme offers compensation for ceasing permanently to cut turf on the designated sites and does not involve purchase of the sites.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	369	Raised bogs in Ireland contain rare and threatened natural habitats that are protected under National and European law. A small number of raised bogs are on sites that are designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) or National Heritage Areas (NHAs). Raised bogs have almost vanished due to land reclamation, drainage and turf extraction. These sites are among the best examples of the tiny proportion of such habitats left in Europe.There are over 1500 raised bogs in Ireland and 139 of these have been designated for nature protection within 130 sites. In area, they comprise less than 5% of the peatlands in the State where turf-cutting is feasible. My Department estimates that there are up to 2600 active turf cutters on these bogs. The tables give details of the location and areas of these sites.Almost all raised bogs outside these sites would not now meet the criteria for  designation or restoration due to drainage, exploitation and land-use change. However, many of these bogs are suitable for turf-extraction and relocation of turf-cutters to such areas is likely to be feasible in most cases. As such, measures recently announced are not incompatible with the continuation of traditional activities, but will necessitate a relocation of such activities to non-designated bogs.Traditional activities in Ireland and across the EU, encompassing a range of disciplines such as agriculture, fishing, hunting, land use and industry have all had to adapt to the requirements of EU directives, including those aimed at environmental protection. Turf-cutting is no different, in this regard.The European Commission has commenced infringement proceedings against the Irish Government regarding its obligations under the Habitats Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive with regard to the regulation of turf extraction from designated sites.  Myself and my officials are in regular contact with the Commission in relation to this matter.In early April I announced the establishment of an independently chaired Peatlands Council to respond to commitments set out in the Programme for Government and to assist Ireland to respond in a strategic way to the requirements of the Habitats Directive.  The Council is chaired by Mr Conor Skehan and includes representatives of the IFA, the Irish Peatlands Conservation Council, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, Irish Rural Link, the Irish Environment Network, Bord na Móna and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  The Peatlands Council also provides a framework for stakeholder involvement in addressing the immediate issues regarding the protection of these sites and arrangements for compensation and relocation.The Council has met on several occasions and this week made significant progress in regard to agreeing a work programme to addressing the needs of turf-cutters while recognizing the necessity to stop turf-cutting on Ireland's raised bog SACs.In April, I also announced a long term compensation package for turf-cutters in sites where turf cutting is no longer possible. The scheme, which applies immediately to turf-cutters on 31 raised bog SACs, will deliver payments of €1,000 per annum for a maximum of 15 years. As an alternative to financial payments, and where feasible, qualifying turf-cutters will be facilitated in relocating to alternative, non-designated sites to continue cutting turf. Alternative forms of compensation will be explored by the Peatlands Council.The Government is committed to building a shared understanding of our peatlands encompassing the issues of conservation and tradition and to reaching an equitable resolution to this important issue.No.YearSite CodeSite NameCountyHectares  of SAC% of Raised Bog HabitatHectares of Raised Bog Habitat11997000006Killyconny Bog (Cloghbally)Cavan/Meath191.2246%87.9621997000231Barroughter BogGalway174.0253%92.2331997000248Cloonmoylan BogGalway554.4271%393.6441997000285Kilsallagh BogGalway279.7368%190.2251997000296Lisnageeragh Bog and Ballinstack TurloughGalway455.4962%282.4061997000301Lough Lurgeen Bog/ Glenamaddy TurloughGalway1,162.1151%592.6871997000326Shankill West BogGalway136.3952%70.9281997000382Sheheree (Ardagh) BogKerry17.0738%6.4991997000391Ballynafagh BogKildare156.4643%67.28*101997000440Lough Ree*Ros/LD/WM14,371.243%431.14111997000457Derrynabrock BogMayo/Roscommon

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	371	As a conservation measure to protect coarse fish stocks, my Department introduced the Conservation of and Prohibition on Sale of Coarse Fish Bye-Law No. 806 of 2006, which provides for an angling bag limit of 4 coarse fish in any one day.  It also prohibits the killing of any coarse fish greater than 25 cm in length and prohibits the sale of any coarse fish in Ireland.If the Club referred to by the Deputy believes that these measures are inadequate from a conservation perspective, they should raise the matter with Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), which operates under the aegis of my Department and is responsible for the protection, management and conservation of the inland fisheries resource.If, following expert assessment, IFI considers a strengthening of the conservation measures is warranted, it will make an appropriate recommendation for a revision of the byelaws, which I will consider.

I understand that the report got under way in April and is due to be completed by the end of June.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I propose to take Question Nos. 99 to 101, inclusive, together.I announced the launch of  ‘Better Energy: The National Upgrade Programme’ on Wednesday, 11 May 2011 on foot of the Jobs Initiative.  Better Energy   will replace the three existing energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes: the Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES), the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) and the Greener Homes Scheme (GHS).The residential strand of Better Energy allows domestic customers to apply for an Exchequer supported incentive, currently a grant but which will migrate to an upfront discount later in the year.  The measures grant-aided under this strand include roof and wall insulation, high efficiency boilers, heating control upgrades and solar thermal. Since its launch in March 2006 the Greener Homes Scheme has provided Government support of €72m towards the installation of over 33,000 renewable energy heating systems.  In addition, the Home Energy Saving scheme, has provided over €84m in grant support to over 85,000 homes for the implementation of nearly 200,000 measures.  Both schemes are now fully integrated into Better Energy.  The capital allocation for Better Energy in 2011 is €91.4m and the current grant levels are set out in the table.The Better Energy grant levels have been set to ensure that the level of Exchequer support is in line with market prices.  Since the HES scheme was launched in 2009, there have been substantial reductions in the prices being charged for most of the measures covered by the scheme, the exception being external insulation, which is a relatively new technology in Ireland.  It is clearly essential that the level of Exchequer support reflects market prices.  Measures being supported under the Better Energy programme are those designed to deliver the greatest energy savings, maximising the value achieved from the available budget allocation.In relation to the issuing of IDs to contractors I am advised by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which administers the Programme on my behalf, that where fully compliant documentation is submitted, contractors are registered within two working days.  Since Better Energy Homes went live the SEAI have already registered over 160 contractors for solar energy installations, bringing the total number of registered contractors to over 2,800.The SEAI have streamlined registration in order to minimise the additional documentation that is required from contractors previously registered for HES or GHS that want to become a Better Energy contractor.One of the key objectives of the Better Energy programme is to support the construction sector and the delivery of quality installations in line with good practice.  This includes agreement to a code of practice and technical specification in relation to the work to be undertaken by a contractor, evidence of tax compliance, appropriate insurance and training for delivery of the work for which a contractor is registered.  These requirements are fully appropriate in the interests of consumer protection and the proper disbursement of public funds.Pay-as-you-save is a financial model which would allow energy consumers to finance energy efficiency upgrades through the energy savings generated.  The Programme for Government commits to the roll out of a pay-as-you-save scheme after 2013 to enable the home energy efficiency programme to continue without recourse to public funding.  My Department is working with SEAI, the utilities and financial institutions to develop proposals for the introduction of a national pay-as-you-save scheme in line with this timeframe.There are considerable complexities involved in the development of a pay-as-you-save scheme and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders will be required.  I expect to bring forward legislation to underpin the scheme next year.Better EnergySupport Levels €€Roof Insulation200Cavity wall insulation320Internal Wall Dry-Lining2,000External wall insulation4,000High Efficiency Gas or Oil fired Boiler with Heating Controls Upgrade560Heating Controls Upgrade400BER After Upgrade Works (Only one BER grant per home)80Solar Thermal800
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 is divided into four axes. Axis 1 deals with competitiveness of the agricultural sector, Axis 2 aims to improve the countryside and environment and the objectives of Axis 3 are to support the diversification of the rural economy and improve the quality of life in rural areas.Axis 4 or the LEADER Axis provides support for the use of a "bottom up" approach to development which ensures that local people are involved in the decision making thereby facilitating sustainable development in a more inclusive way. In Ireland the LEADER approach is used to implement Axis 3 measures.The programme is designed to address directly many of the challenges facing rural communities including the need to increase economic activity and stimulate job creation; improve access to basic services for rural dwellers and encourage rural tourism based on sustainable development of natural resources. In January 2011 the EU raised concerns regarding certain types of projects being funded under Axis 3 of the RDP and informed the Irish authorities that support/grant aid for adding value to products listed on Annex 1 to the EC Treaty may only be supported under Axis 1 of the current RDP.Basic agricultural products are listed in Annex 1 to the EC Treaty and are commonly called Annex 1 products. Under the main Rural Development Regulation 1698/2005 support/grant aid for adding value to Annex 1 products is facilitated under Axis 1 of the programme. In this context the Commission pointed out that the resolution of the issue is a matter for the member state.The project referred to in the question falls into the category of supporting Annex 1 products and therefore cannot be supported at this time. My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are currently working together with the support of the European Commission to resolve the issue. Negotiations are currently ongoing with a view to reaching a solution as soon as possible.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	375	The Greater Dublin Strategic Drainage Study (GDSDS) analysed the existing drainage system in the Greater Dublin area and proposed policies, strategies and projects for developing this system to meet future needs.  In relation to waste water treatment capacity, the study recommended that, in addition to the expansion of the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant, a future regional wastewater treatment plant should be constructed in the Portrane/Donabate area of Fingal.  Fingal County Council decided that certain aspects of the GDSDS should first be subjected to a Strategic Environmental Assessment.The Strategic Environmental Assessment assessed sixteen strategic drainage options for the Greater Dublin Area.  I am therefore satisfied that, through this process,  the issue of alternative options has been addressed.The Strategic Environmental Assessment concluded that a new regional wastewater treatment plant should be built in the Northern Greater Dublin Area and that the outfall should be located along the North Dublin coastline following a detailed site selection process.All of the local authorities accepted the outcome of the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Fingal County Council has appointed a consultant to prepare a Preliminary Report for the scheme, including a recommendation on the optimum location for the proposed treatment plant. The location of the new plant is to be determined based on the site selection criteria set out in the Environmental Report of the Strategic Environmental Assessment.I understand that Fingal County Council has initiated a public consultation to ascertain what issues or concerns should be taken into account in determining the locations of the three elements of the Greater Dublin Drainage project (the new wastewater treatment works, a marine outfall and new drainage network in the northern part of the Greater Dublin Area).

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	377	Under my Department's renewal or repair of thatched roof grant scheme, a grant of up to €3,810, or two thirds of the approved cost, whichever is the lesser, may be payable in respect of necessary works to renew or repair the thatched roofs of houses. A higher grant of up to €5,714 may be payable where the house is situated on certain specified islands off the West and South coasts. In the case of medical card holders, a grant of up to €6,350, or up to 80% of the approved cost, may be payable in respect of houses situated on the mainland, rising to €8,252 where the house is situated on a specified off-shore island.Eligibility under the grant scheme is contingent on the house being occupied as a normal place of residence on completion of the approved works.The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has provided funding under the Local Authority Conservation Grant Scheme for the conservation of structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010, which was administered by the local authorities.  The Department has also administered a Civic Structures Conservation Grants Scheme for the conservation of structures in civic or public ownership. Due to the significant reduction in the budgetary allocation to the built heritage within the vote of that Department, the operation of both grant schemes has been suspended. However, the Department concerned is providing limited funds in 2011 to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010 through a Structures at Risk Fund. Details on the operation of this fund were issued to each local authority in March 2011. Assessment of applications received by the closing date for this fund was recently undertaken by that Department and the relevant local authorities will be notified of the outcome shortly.My Department is aware that the Heritage Council, which is funded by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, administer a number of conservation grants schemes including the Heritage Management Scheme. Conservation works to thatched structures may be eligible under this scheme. I understand that the closing dates for applications for 2011 have now passed.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	378	The requirement to report a death to a coroner and whether to subsequently conduct an inquest is set out in sections 17 and 18 of the Coroners Act 1962. Under Coroners'  Rules of Practice, as outlined on the Coroners website www.coroners.ie, maternal deaths relating to childbirth are required to be reported to the coroner. The Coroners Bill 2007, confirms this by providing, inter-alia, in the Third Schedule on Deaths Reportable to Coroner, for the reporting of “any maternal death that occurs during or following pregnancy (up to a period of six weeks post-partum) or that might be related to pregnancy”.Fortunately, maternal deaths are exceptionally rare and this State has one of the lowest maternal mortality rates in the world. However, where such deaths occur, they are reported to a coroner and an autopsy would normally be held. It is then a matter for the coroner to decide, having regard to the circumstances of the maternal death, whether an inquest is necessary to determine the circumstances. There may be cases where an inquest would be unnecessary and leaving it to the discretion of the coroner is, therefore, considered to be the most appropriate public policy position.

As I indicated in my contribution to Dail debate on the launch of a short term visa waiver programme for visitors travelling to Ireland from the UK, I believe there is scope for my Department to play a more proactive role in the national recovery effort and the area of entrepreneurship and investment is a case in point.

The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order, signed on 8th March 2011, following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim, and a detailed examination of the representations he submitted for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). The Deportation Order requires him to remove himself from the State and remain thereafter outside the State. He did not remove himself from the State and had been evading deportation by failing to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau ('GNIB') since 2nd April 2011. He has only recently complied with the requirement to present to GNIB and last reported to GNIB on the 26th May 2011.An application pursuant to Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), has been made by the legal representative of the person concerned. This application, which seeks to allow the person concerned to re-enter the asylum process, is under consideration at present. When a decision has been made on that application, that decision, and the consequences of that decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.

The 505 Squadron provides the ATC service at Baldonnel and for airspace designated for the use of the Air Corps which enables military pilots to conduct their flights in a safe environment.  The service is achieved by Air Traffic Controllers transmitting instructions to pilots in the form of ‘air traffic control clearances' and by providing vital flight information and navigational assistance.  In addition, air traffic controllers are responsible for providing an ‘Alerting and Emergency Service' and initiating ‘Search and Rescue' action for aircraft which may require assistance.  Civilian aircraft operating within, or transiting through military airspace, are also provided with a service appropriate to their particular needs.The service is provided by a number of controllers who man a variety of co-located and interdependent control positions, collectively called the ‘ATC Watch'.  A standard ATC Watch normally comprises of an ATC Watch Supervisor, Aerodrome Controller and Approach Radar Controller.   There are currently six fully qualified and five partially qualified personnel in Air Traffic Control. All eleven personnel have Tower qualifications and five of these also have Radar qualifications.  Eight personnel including two Air Corps Headquarters personnel are on-the-job training instructors who may provide training to controllers in Air Traffic Control positions. On the job instruction is provided at all times during normal working hours to ensure maximum use is made of suitable traffic situations.  There are two personnel currently undergoing on the job training. In 2010 six controllers left and replacements are currently being trained.  There are two personnel currently performing duties of a higher grade.I have no plans to carry out a review of the ATC function within the Defence Forces.

The Barracks is of limited military use apart from use by the Reserve Defence Force which is limited to a much reduced area of the property known as the former OPW Depot.  In 2002 due to the interest of The Heritage Council, An Taisce and the very strong feelings put forward by local representatives and community groups' consideration was given to transferring the property to Nenagh Town Council for public use on the basis of a long lease.  It was felt at the time that this was the best solution in relation to a property which undoubtedly, has heritage merit but which has fallen into disrepair with consequent attendant health and safety considerations.However, at a meeting with Nenagh Town Council in December, 2009 the Department was informed that the Town Council no longer wished to acquire the property.  This property, as with all surplus property, will be disposed of taking account of market conditions, so as to maximise the return to the Defence Forces and generate funding for reinvestment in equipment and infrastructure.

The issuing of birth certificates is a matter for the Department of Social Protection, and suspected irregularities should be investigated by that Department. The scale of such illegal birth registrations is unknown.The issue of historical documentation and records, where such information ever existed, was a matter for these private institutions. My understanding is that very little documentation existed, and where it did, the nature and secretiveness of the process means that any correlation of data is extremely difficult.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Under the Health Act 2007 statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), for the independent inspection and registration of certain categories of designated centres.  This includes residential care settings for older people.   Since 1 July 2009 all nursing homes, public and private, are registered under the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, by the Chief Inspector.  All nursing homes (public and private) are inspected under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, and must meet the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.
The Chief Inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with the regulations or the standards.There are separate criteria for designated centres which were in operation when the new regime commenced on 1 July 2009 and for new centres that have opened since that date. Designated centres which were in operation at the commencement of the new regime have up to six years from that date to meet the criteria for new centres. This would include centres such as Kenmare.Any capital development such as the proposed Community Nursing Unit at Kenmare, Co Kerry must be considered in the context of the overall HSE Capital Plan.  This is a multi-annual programme which is developed over a rolling five year period.  In drawing up its capital programme for the current 2011-2015 period the HSE is required to prioritise capital infrastructure projects within the overall capital funding allocation.  Given the level of capital commitments already in place, there is limited funding available for new contracts before 2014.    The HSE has submitted its draft Capital Plan for the multi-annual period 2011 — 2015. This draft plan is under consideration and requires the approval of the Minister for Health and Children with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Details of the plan will be published by the HSE following its approval.

In 2011, one course was run in Adelaide Meath and National Children's Hospital (AMNCH Tallaght).  The Health Service Executive currently has no plans in place to run any further return to nursing practice programmes.  However, the requirement to recommence this programme will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.

I understand that the full report cannot be released as it specifically relates to the patient care and personal circumstances of an individual whose rights must be respected.  However, all of the recommendations of the report have been released other than one which relates to the individual patient.  Details of these recommendations are included in my reply to you of 26 May 2011 in response to Parliamentary Question 109 .

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.My Department receives an average of 6,000 Parliamentary Questions each year.  Around 60% of these questions concern operational issues and are referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to Deputies.  Many of these questions relate to individual patients and local day to day operational matters.  The HSE is a statutory body with its own vote and Accounting Officer and is statutorily responsible for operational matters in the health service.  There is a commitment in the HSE's 2011 Service Plan to answer 75% of questions referred to it within 15 working days.The Programme for Government contains a number of commitments to improving the way Parliamentary Questions, Adjournment Debates etc. are dealt with. I expect that these initiatives will be progressed across all Government Departments in due course.  As noted by the Deputy, since taking office I have decided that Parliamentary Questions relating to operational issues of a national scale or importance will now be answered by myself or the relevant Minister of State instead of being referred to the HSE.  Whenever possible these questions will be answered on the relevant Dáil sitting day.  Where this is not possible because the information is not readily available, a reply will be issued as soon as possible thereafter.Questions concerning individual patients and operational matters relating to local issues will continue to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to Deputies.  While my Department has ultimate accountability for the health services, it is my belief that a balance has to be struck between responsibility for local issues, which rests with local area service managers, and the ultimate accountability of Ministers.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	420	The Health Service Executive may, subject to the resources available to it,  provide funding from its overall service budget to an organisation to provide services on its behalf, or a service that is similar or ancillary to, a service the Executive provides. A voluntary body seeking assistance should make a written application to the HSE, setting out the purpose for which the assistance is required and all other relevant information, including details of the organisation's financial position.   The Health Service Executive is also in receipt of National Lottery funding and makes grants available from this source to local voluntary organisations and other organisations.  I am not directly involved in decisions regarding these grants, which are determined locally or regionally within the HSE.In addition, my Department has a National Lottery discretionary fund in place which provides once-off grants to community groups and organisations, providing a range of health related services. The assessment of applications is made on the basis that these grants are intended to be discretionary once-off funding and is not intended to fund ongoing services. My Department has no record of an application from the Group referred to by the Deputy. If the organisation wishes to make an application for National Lottery Funding they should send in a formal application. Detailed procedures, along with the application form are set out on my Department's website —www.dohc.ie.
Funding provided by the Vocational Education Committees is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills. Funding provided to local Partnerships is a matter for Pobal, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.
