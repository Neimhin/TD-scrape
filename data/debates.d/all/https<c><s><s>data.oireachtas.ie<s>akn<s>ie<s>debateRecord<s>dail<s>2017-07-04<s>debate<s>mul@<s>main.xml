          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">Two weeks ago we briefly discussed the sad passing of Thomas Power who could not access emergency heart treatment in Waterford University Hospital. Today Deputies Mary Butler and David Cullinane hosted a meeting in the Leinster House audio-visual room for public representatives at which Thomas Power’s sister gave a heart-rending account of the devastation endured by her and her family as a result of her brother’s untimely death. She used simple words to encapsulate the entire event, namely, that the doors had been closed to him in seeking access to emergency heart treatment or intervention. Thousands more in the south east are beyond the 90-minute window that cardiologists say is the essential timeframe within which to be treated from first medical contact. Others argue that it is less than that, but every minute counts, as the Taoiseach knows.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> In 2012 a national assessment was made and Waterford University Hospital featured as a designated PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention, centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">In essence, it was to be a centre for emergency heart treatment. The third appendix to the report identified the issues that would have to be addressed. Essentially, it stated that Waterford has the potential and needed a second cath lab. A configuration report by Professor Higgins again calls for an extension of the facilities at Waterford hospital in terms of PCI and interventional cardiology facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> A business report was presented in 2014. It was accepted by the clinical review team in the south east at the time and it was sent to the HSE. It was accepted and those concerned were told the facility was queued for funding. I spoke to Dr. Owens about this some time back. He is a very reasonable man. He, along with Dr. Colwell from South Tipperary General Hospital, Dr. Mark Doyle, an emergency medicine consultant, and others have all identified the lack of a second cath lab as a major risk to safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> What happened in 2014-2015? Why was the second cath lab not proceeded with? Why was the essence of the 2012 report and the configuration report not acted on before 2016? Why has so little happened even since last year, when the Minister made commitments in here to give eight hours extra? Nothing has happened. With regard to the provision of the mobile cath lab, nothing has happened in the past 12 months. The national review we were promised has not happened either. People in the south east, in particular in Waterford, are very angry and they feel marginalised and alienated. They feel there is a lack of any meaningful response from the Government on this issue.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_2">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_6">Once again, on behalf of the Government, I convey my sincere condolences to the family of Thomas Power on their very sad loss. As the Deputy knows, I cannot comment on individual cases. However, I stress the importance of patient confidentiality and patient privacy. The Minister for Health expects, as I do, that all proper procedures will take place with regard to the examination of the circumstances of Mr. Power's death, be it through a case review or an inquest, to find out what happened and why.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> Last year, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government, an independent review of the need for a second cath lab at University Hospital Waterford was undertaken by Dr. Niall Herity, a world-renowned cardiology expert. The review concluded that the needs of the effective catchment population of University Hospital Waterford could be accommodated from a single cath lab. However, investment was recommended to enhance cardiology services at the hospital and provide an additional eight hours of activity per week to reduce waiting times and provide increased access for patients. At the time of the publication, the Minister, Deputy Harris, committed to providing the additional resources to the hospital. The HSE's national service plan of 2017 subsequently identified the implementation of the recommendations of the Herity report as a priority, and additional funding of €0.5 million was provided. An additional €0.5 million in funding was provided in 2017 to enable the hospital to provide two additional cath lab sessions per week, as per Dr. Herity's recommendations. The cath lab is now funded to provide 12 sessions, that is, 48 hours of activity per week. The HSE issued a tender, last week, for a mobile cath lab, which will contribute on an interim basis to the further reduction in elective cardiology waiting lists at the hospital. The Minister is also committed to a further review to assess the impact that these improvements have had on the volume of patients attending. This review will take place at the end of the deployment of the mobile cath lab.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> With regard to emergency work at hospital, all decisions on how we configure our health services must be evidence based. Dr. Herity recommended that emergency work cease in order to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned work and contribute to improved patient outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> The organisation of primary PCI services is an issue for the whole country and it relates to how we provide services for our whole population, taking into account the best evidence available. The Minister for Health is, therefore, committed to a full national review of primary PCI services and his Department will make the arrangements for this to be undertaken based on the independent clinical expertise. This national review will, of course, include the south east of the country. It will seek to ensure that as many patients as possible can have access on a 24/7 basis to a safe and sustainable emergency intervention service following the type of heart attack in question. The review will, therefore, deal with the wider implications for all services in all parts of the country of Dr. Herity's recommendations regarding primary PCI services and come up with a plan for the achievement of the best patient outcomes possible, with clinical safety being paramount.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_10">A man died because he could not get access to emergency heart treatment within any reasonable timeframe. People feel the time for review is over. I asked the Taoiseach a very specific question. The clinical review team said to go ahead with the second cath lab. A business case was made in 2013 and 2014. Who stopped that? Can someone give me a transparent answer to that question? Why was there a need for the Herity report at all when, according to the 2012 assessment of 12 designated centres, Waterford was identified as having the potential to become a PCI centre with expansion? Who actually stopped that in 2014 and 2015? The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, is blaming invisible civil servants for stopping the Minister from doing what he wants to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The Taoiseach read out a statement about the national review. He could have been reading what the Minister, Deputy Harris, wrote in response to a parliamentary question ten months ago on 28 September of last year. He stated, "A national review of PPCI and PCI services is to be undertaken and completed by July 2017; recommendations will be made regarding the future configuration of these services, including the number and location of centres required to serve the population needs". The only difference is that the Taoiseach has moved it 12 months forward or maybe beyond. People feel that the Taoiseach has no credibility in reiterating meaningless statements of that kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Can the Taoiseach give me an indication or a reason as to why someone stopped the implementation of the 2012 recommendations and the actioning of that in terms of the business case of 2013 and 2014? The consultants in Waterford were making this case very strongly to everybody who would listen. They were clinicians as well. For some reason someone said we were not having that and that a new review was needed to bury this thing once and for all. I put it to the Taoiseach that if he follows the Herity report to the letter, which he seems to want to do, the idea of ceasing emergency heart treatment makes absolutely no sense.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">Last week, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, announced a new charging regime for the collection of household waste that is grossly unfair. It fails to recognise that many people will not be able to afford increased charges. The Taoiseach's Government failed to include any meaningful alleviation measures for those on low incomes. Citizens and families across the land have been left to the mercy of private operators, especially those who produce higher than average waste because of their age, disability, ill-health or family size.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Incredibly, the Taoiseach seems confident that a measly annual grant of €75, less than €1.50 per week, will make a difference. It would make Ebenezer Scrooge blush. It is in keeping with a nasty, mean-spirited Government that is implementing its nasty policies and mean-spirited choices with no regard for how ordinary people live. </p>
          <p eId="para_38"> The Taoiseach's lack of empathy on the issue is shameful. His indifference towards the people in question is predictable and it seems that his Government has learned nothing from the water charges debacle. He seems to think people across the State will simply take it lying down. The Government got it wrong on water charges and it is getting it wrong again on this issue. It fails to understand the anger its unjust charging scheme has provoked in communities. It seems that it just does not get it, but the nodders and winkers in Fianna Fáil will save the Government's bacon. Fianna Fáil's spoiler motion is aimed at blocking any real opposition to the imposition of the charging regime proposed.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">It has been designed to get the Taoiseach's detached Government off the hook, but it will not prevent further hardship or protect the most vulnerable. Ordinary people are getting another sharp reminder that they just cannot trust Fianna Fáil to do what is fair. The Government and its partners in Fianna Fáil collaborate to ensure punitive charges will be imposed on those who simply cannot pay. The Government is creating a free-for-all designed to serve the profit-chasing instincts of commercial operators. Many are frightened that an increase in waste collection charges will make them the bill that will make it impossible to make ends meet. They are not interested in the Taoiseach's choice of socks, rather they are interested in what he is going to do to ensure they will not be exposed to an increase in their waste collection charges. As of today, his answers to questions indicate that he will do absolutely nothing to help. It seems that he is happy that a free-for-all will ensue. Will he try to break through his fog of indifference and lack of empathy? Is he happy that those on low incomes, the sick, those living with disabilities and large families will suffer directly as a result of his decisions? Will he immediately withdraw this unfair charging system and put in place a waiver scheme for vulnerable citizens?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T14:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_40">The Taoiseach may have changed, but the scripted outrage of Sinn Féin has not. It is almost a cut and paste of a speech on a question on a similar issue not that long ago. Fundamentally, it is about the environment. Landfills in Ireland are filling up. We do not want any new dump. I do not know of a single Deputy in this House who would like to have a dump in his or her constituency or town. I do not know of a single person in the country who would like to have to live beside a new dump or landfill site. Therefore, we need to reduce the volume of waste and recycle, re-use and compost more. Charging for bin collection is not new. It has been the norm for householders for 15 years and there are no new charges proposed. There will be a new system of charges, but 50% of households already pay under it. They are the people who pay by lift and by weight and with or without a standing charge. Therefore, 50% of households have been paying under this system for quite some time and are well used to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The system will change for the 50% of households which are not paying under the new system, who pay a flat charge once a year, regardless of how much they throw away, but it will not change overnight. Contracts stand and remain. The new system will be phased in in the next 15 months. The Government does acknowledge that there is a concern about a sudden or massive hike in charges under the guise of a new system. We understand there is this concern and it is a legitimate fear people may have. We have, therefore, agreed to put in place a watchdog that will monitor prices. We reserve the right as a Government to bring forward price regulation if the industry hikes prices or uses the change as a cover to dramatically hike prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> I should point out that it is not an unregulated industry. This is not a free-for-all. A licensing system is in place. Someone cannot just collect bins. He or she needs a licence in order to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">What we do not have is price regulation. Bear in mind that price regulation does not necessarily mean that prices will not go up. We have price regulation in many areas, such as for taxis, energy, aviation and just because there is price regulation does not necessarily mean that prices do not go up. The best way to ensure quality and standards is through licensing, which we have - one needs a licence from a local authority, the regulator, to collect bins - and also through competition. There is much competition. What will happen now is that the 50% of households that are not already on the new system will, over the course of the next 15 months, as their annual contracts expire, have bin companies come to them to offer options, possibly to pay by lift, to pay by weight, or to continue to pay an annual standing charge and then pay by lift or by weight. As I said already, half the country is already on the system.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">I note that despite the fact that the Taoiseach may have changed, the same robotic, out of touch, insensitive politics still remain in place under the new regime. The Taoiseach seems to have great faith in the bin companies and the waste operators. He tells us that he is establishing a watchdog. He accepts that there is no price regulation. Good for him. He needs to remedy that and he needs to go much further. He needs to step outside of his robotic zone and connect himself with the real world, the world in which people now worry that they cannot afford this bill. That might sound like scripted outrage to the Taoiseach's delicate ears, but sadly, it is the reality that people have now experienced for many years under the watch of Fine Gael. It is important that those of us elected here come in and reflect that reality to people like the Taoiseach, who are clearly at some distance from it. What will the Taoiseach do for people in ill health, for people with disabilities, for our older citizens, and for large families that cannot make this bill? What alleviation measures will he introduce and when will we see the detail of them?</p>

          <p eId="para_60">I am certainly going to give the Taoiseach the opportunity to listen and to reply. Some 15 years ago, the results of a study informed the Government and society. It was the sexual abuse and violence in Ireland study on the prevalence of sexual assault and violence in the country at the time. The groundbreaking study exposed facts which were very difficult for us to comprehend and deal with, giving an insight as to how difficult it must be for the victims of sexual and domestic violence. Up to 2002, the only figures available were based on the numbers seeking counselling or going to the Garda. The service providers were keenly aware that these figures were not reliable and were the tip of the iceberg.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">The report, the sexual assault and violence in Ireland study to which I refer, saw 3,120 men and women participate. The landmark study confirmed exactly the concerns of the service providers. It established that more than 47% of those reporting abuse in SAVI had never told another person. Moreover, almost a quarter of the men who took part, 24%, and almost one third of women reported some level of abuse in childhood and a staggering figure of 40% of women and 28% of men reported some form of sexual assault or abuse during their lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> Unfortunately, that was 15 years ago. That study has never been replicated or updated, leaving us in a situation where policy is being formulated and legislation enacted, if not in a vacuum, certainly in a very limited space.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, in January of this year, told us that without accurate and comprehensive data the State itself cannot understand the extent of, not to mention deal with, sexual assault and domestic violence. The National Women's Council of Ireland has clearly told us the collection of data and analysis around domestic and sexual violence is at crisis point. The European Union fundamental rights agency revealed that Ireland has the second highest number of women avoiding places or situations for fear of being assaulted, etc. I could go on but I know the Taoiseach is listening carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> My question is very simple. Can the Taoiseach please commit to updating this study? I note the Tánaiste, who is sitting beside him, in her former life, made very positive comments in regard to this, acknowledged the need for evidence-based research and committed to a review if the funding could be found. I am simply saying to the Taoiseach we cannot afford not to find the funding, given the implications of this degree of sexual violence on every level of society.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T14:25:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_65">I thank Deputy Connolly for raising this important issue in the House and assure her and the House of the Government's deep commitment to taking action against gender-based violence, sexual violence and domestic violence which all of us condemn and abhor.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> The SAVI study was done in 2002, which as the Deputy stated, was 15 years ago. I am told there have been European studies that have given us some statistical evidence in this area since then and, of course, the priority over the past 15 years has been the development of services, many of which have improved considerably - for example, additional refuges, new legislation in this field and also additional funding for many of the organisations that provide support to those who are affected by gender-based violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> It is a matter under consideration at present as to whether we have a second SAVI study. I agree that 15 years is a long time and a big gap to leave between two studies. It is costed at roughly €1 million, which is a considerable amount of money. Of course, it could be argued that €1 million would be better put into services and enforcement rather than into studies. However, that is something that needs to be considered by Government across different Departments because in order to plan services well, one needs good information and good statistics. It is certainly something that I will discuss with Ministers.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">There is a point I can take the Taoiseach up on that he has not used in regard to that. I welcome the matter is under consideration but I would ask for a scála ama, a timescale, immediately. The Taoiseach referred to refuges. Let me confirm that, according to the Council of Europe, we need 446 family refuge places in Ireland; we have 143.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> In regard to the cost, let me refer to the cost of a subsection of that violence, which is domestic violence. It costs €2.2 billion to the economy every year and I can tell the Taoiseach how that is laid out in terms of hospital visits, loss of productivity, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> In regard to putting funding into front-line services and not into research, the one follow-up that did take place of this groundbreaking research was four years later it was found that those who had participated, who had never before revealed sexual abuse, confirmed that it was a positive experience. Therefore, not only will the Government save money - perhaps I can get through to the Taoiseach on that level in terms of the cost of not dealing with being €2.2 billion - but on a psychological level, it is extremely good for the participants because this groundbreaking research and the follow-up were sensitively carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">That is what is important about this. We have no choice. I appeal to the Taoiseach. Referring to European facts is not helpful at this point. I have all of them and have carried out the research. I acknowledge the other Deputies, including those of Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil and Solidarity, who have repeatedly raised this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">First, the timeline for making any decision such as this will be in the context of the Estimates. Departments will know in October what the budget for next year is, provided it is voted through by this House. We will then be able to make a decision on whether we should have another sexual abuse and violence in Ireland report. I am told that the research conducted at European level is of good quality. The Departments concerned believe the associated statistical information is useful. As is always the case in any spending, there is not only the cost but also the opportunity cost. We will have to consider whether the €1 million might be better spent on services and in enforcement rather than on studies, but I accept the fundamental point the Deputy is making which is that if we want to plan services well, we need an evidence base behind them. I draw attention to the new legislation brought through in recent times. It is both important and significant. It provides for protection orders, whereby a woman or a man who is the victim of domestic violence can stay in the home rather than having to move to a refuge. The new orders and the new law put personal safety ahead of property rights. It is progressive legislation which means that instead of a victim of violence having to leave home, it is the perpetrator who must go.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">Fishermen, fisher-women and the fishing industry in general have been the poor relation in Irish politics. The fishing industry has struggled to be recognised as the second most important in the country owing to a lack of vision shown by successive Governments. On Sunday the British who have been sweetening the Irish Government up to now with some nice words about Brexit came out and showed, in respect of the fishing industry, that they wanted to see a hard Brexit. They want Irish trawlers out of British waters, in which up until now we have fished 60% of our mackerel stock and 40% of our prawn stock. Also, European trawlers will have to exit British waters. The Taoiseach knows well to where they will turn when this happens: straight into Irish waters. In recent years some €2.5 million worth of Irish fish has left the port of Castletownbere alone weekly in foreign vessels for Spain. This is an extraordinary loss to Irish fishermen and the economy. In an interview on RTE Radio 1 on Sunday the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, when pushed on the announcement made by the British, accepted that it would be a disaster if it were to happen. However, what was most worrying was that when the Minister was pushed further, he accepted that the Government had no plan B. In all honesty, it has no plan A or plan B for Irish fishermen and Governments have not had for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> Recently at the Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs representatives of fishing organisations were present for several hours. The unfair way in which many fishermen are being treated is scandalous, to say the least. Fishermen from the south west only possess 13% of mackerel fishing rights, while those in the north west possess 87%. Public representatives and the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation did their best on the day to put the case. We said all we wanted was that if a further quota became available, fishermen in the south west should be given first choice, but all of our efforts will fall on deaf ears.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> Fishermen are facing and have faced some tough years. Inshore fishermen have been almost totally forgotten. In 2007 the Government of the day introduced a ban on drift-net fishing for salmon in Irish waters. This had a devastating effect on all coastal communities. Drift-net fishing for salmon was the lifeblood of offshore islands and rural communities where the only employment to be gained was in fishing or farming. The ban should never have been introduced and was to have been reviewed after seven years. Ten years later, there has been no review and none is planned. In 2007 inshore fishermen were blamed for the drop in salmon stocks, but the so-called experts have been proved wrong as stocks have not yet recovered. In turn, it has led to anglers and other bodies seeking a seal cull.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> The Taoiseach has a unique opportunity to be different from his predecessors in respect of the fishing industry. How does he intend to deal with the announcement made by the British over the weekend?</p>
          <p eId="para_77">How does he propose to deal with the massive anomaly whereby south west fishermen have only 13% of the mackerel rights? In regard to inshore fishermen, will the Taoiseach provide for a review of the salmon drift net fishing ban, which is now three years overdue? If the Taoiseach and the Government are serious about the importance of the fishing industry, will he appoint a designated Minister for the marine with sole responsibility for rebuilding the fishing industry in this country?</p>

          <p eId="para_78">The announcement by the UK that it is withdrawing from the London Fisheries Convention is very unwelcome. It is important to note that this forms part of the UK's approach and negotiating position to broader Brexit negotiations. The announcement will have no immediate affect, as the withdrawal process for the convention takes at least two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> As the Deputy will be aware, 35% of the fish that we land is taken from UK waters, including very valuable fish such as mackerel and prawn. I was interested to learn in my study of this issue that we take so much of our fish from UK waters. We hear often about the amount of fish that is taken from our waters by others but, as I said, 35% of the fish we land, is taken from British waters. As noted yesterday by Michel Barnier, the UK decision to withdraw from the convention does not trigger any immediate change. He is now focused on prioritising the fisheries interests of the EU 27. The threats posed by Brexit to the Irish fishing industry were discussed as recently as last Thursday at a session hosted by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, with the industry at Seafest in Galway. This dialogue with the industry will continue as the situation evolves.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> The Minister, Deputy Creed, and his Department have been working closely with their counterparts in other EU member states that have a particular interest in the north west waters. A unified front on these matters and a united negotiating position by all of these countries is what is best for Ireland and the EU. The Minister, Deputy Creed, will also be speaking to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Gove, MP, this week regarding this matter and other priority issues in the agriculture and fisheries sectors. If there is additional quota, we will strive to ensure that Ireland gets a fair share of it, bearing in mind sustainability. Fisheries stocks all around the world, particularly around Europe, have been horrendously depleted in the last number of decades due to over-fishing. It is not in any of our interests in the long term that that should continue, for all the obvious reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> In terms of mackerel, the mackerel review is ongoing. No decision has yet been taken on it but once a decision is taken the Minister, Deputy Creed, will make an announcement. The Minister for Agriculture, Marine and Food is the Minister with responsibility for the marine and he as at the Cabinet table.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T14:35:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_82">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I do not agree with him that there is not a need for a designated Minister for the marine. The potential to this country is huge if we had a Minister for the marine. Until this is addressed, as I said earlier, the fishing industry will remain the poor relation in Irish politics. I also asked the Taoiseach about the unfair mackerel quota system. I do not think he is clear on this issue. As I said earlier, 87% of the quota goes to the north west and only 13% goes to the south west. If any additional quota becomes available the situation in the south west will have to be addressed going forward. The Taoiseach did not mention the inshore sector, where up to 85% of the fleet are also entitled to a fair share of the quota and not the crumbs. This Government and previous Governments have not realised the social economic benefit which small inshore boats bring to communities. They far outweigh what the big fleets bring.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> I urge the Taoiseach to explore why salmon levels are decreasing, which is of concern to inshore fishermen and anglers. If the Taoiseach will not accede to my earlier request of a review of the drift net salmon ban, will he at least set up a pilot scheme to allow a small number of boats in each county, under the guidance of the Marine Institute to ascertain stocks at sea? If this Government remains laid back on the fishing industry it will have far-reaching implications for this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">As the Deputy will be aware, the Constitution provides for only 15 Ministers at the Cabinet table. To establish a new Department of the marine it would be necessary to abolish another Department. For the duration of this Government, the marine sector will continue to form part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. There are obvious synergies in having agriculture, food and the marine together, for reasons I am sure the Deputy understands.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> In regard to the mackerel issue, I am aware that there is ongoing competition between the fisheries in the south west and the fisheries in Donegal and Killybegs in terms of quota. As I said earlier, the review is ongoing. The Minister, Deputy Creed, has not yet made a decision on the matter but once he has made a decision the Deputy and the industry will be notified of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> On the inshore issue, I will come back to the Deputy on that matter as I do not have up-to-date information on it today. </p>

          <p eId="para_99">Can I raise an objection to the Rugby World Cup Bill going through the House in the fashion that it is proposed? There has been no prelegislative scrutiny of it. We have nothing but the scantiest details about it. We are being asked to commit €320 million of public money. We have not seen anyone from the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, present to a committee, which it could easily have done to answer questions about it. To push that Bill through this House and conclude Second Stage of it within 120 minutes and Committee Stage of it within 120 minutes is wrong. We could defer putting this Bill through until next week. We do not have to agree it this week. We should not commit €320 million of public money without any proper analysis as to where it is going, what the risks are and what are the potential benefits.</p>

          <p eId="para_130"> The programme for Government from last year stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_131">The tender process for the National Broadband Plan is currently underway and will influence the contract’s terms and conditions. Following the completion of the tender process and the awarding of the contract, targeted for June 2017, the new Government will work with the winners to accelerate the roll out of the infrastructure next year. </p>
          <p eId="para_132">It is now July 2017. There are still 542,000 rural homes and businesses without high-speed broadband. It is a complete shambles. No one is clear about the pathway to proper access to broadband across Ireland and people are in despair and have no sense of there being any capacity on the Government's part to deliver this. This will cost jobs in SMEs across rural areas and makes existing jobs difficult to retain. </p>
          <p eId="para_133"> Recently, Deputy Michael Moynihan and I visited Kanturk and met a company, Avonmore electrical, and North Cork Creameries and listened to how they attempt to cope in the absence of high-speed broadband. It reflects on their incredible professionalism and commitment but it speaks very badly of the State and its capacity to roll out a basic tender. Could the Taoiseach explain why the Government's commitment on broadband has not been delivered? Can he explain the delay? When can the homes and businesses across Ireland expect to get access to high-speed quality broadband.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">Last week the Minister, Deputy Naughten, told the Dáil that he did not expect the first homes to be connected to the State broadband scheme until after Eir had concluded a commercial contract connecting 300,000 rural homes to broadband. Can the Taoiseach confirm this? Can he also confirm that over half a million customers in rural areas will not see the roll out of rural broadband commence until at least 2019, after this commercial scheme is completed? Does the Taoiseach accept reports that claim that it could now be 2023 or 2024 before many of these 500,000 homes and businesses see any progress towards linking them to broadband? In the context of Brexit and its likely impact on agriculture, the agrifood industry, fishing communities and rural communities, the failure by Government to deliver broadband places rural Ireland at a distinct economic and social disadvantage. It shows once again that people in rural areas are treated like second class citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">This morning the story broke in the news that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has carried out raids in conjunction with the European Competition Directorate on the offices of insurers, brokers and Insurance Ireland on suspicion of price fixing. I note and welcome this development as drivers and businesses have been ripped off for years. We recently learned that in 2015, the Central Bank wrote to the Minister for Finance, telling him insurers were giving false and misleading information, and the new Minister confirmed to my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, last week that no action was taken. Currently Irish law does not allow the courts to impose any form of civil financial penalty on persons found to have breached competition law. What steps will the Taoiseach take to ensure that if wrongdoing is found to have occurred, this will not be another white collar sector of society where the law does not reach and consumers will not get justice?</p>

The competition Acts are very strong in Ireland already and it is an area where we have very strong legislation and penalties. I have no doubt that if sufficient evidence is found, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will take the necessary action.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">Six months ago RTE first broadcast the "We Need to Talk about Dad" programme and it was aired again last night. Anybody who watched RTE would have been struck by Mr. Brendan Courtney's struggle to care for his dad, Frank, after he was left paralysed by a stroke. The family had to battle to try to get the resources needed to allow him stay in his own home. I and others raised this when the programme was first broadcast six months ago and the Taoiseach's predecessor stated the best option for the future might be a statutory home care scheme, with consultation having to take place on that. Six months on, we have not even seen the beginnings of the consultation. Where is the statutory home care scheme that was supposed to replicate the support scheme for families in the fair deal scheme? While I am standing, I ask about the Leech case I mentioned last week and whether the Taoiseach has had the chance to look at the letter I sent to him.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">There are firm commitments in the programme for Government to increase job creation and the protection of workers' rights. I draw the Taoiseach's attention to an urgent and serious employment issue in Clonmel, County Tipperary, that is developing in a company called SNC-Lavalin. It is a multinational based in Montreal which has 50 office staff employed in Clonmel. When SNC-Lavalin took over from Kentz, a wonderful indigenous company that provided huge employment, guarantees were given to the staff. Now I find that many employees, without warning, have been put on notice that they face redundancy under extremely unfavourable terms and conditions. For some of them it will happen this week while for others it will be in two weeks. There is a commitment to employment and the support of workers in the programme for Government. Will the Taoiseach direct his Minister sitting beside him to engage with the issue as a matter of urgency and do all she can to prevent this happening? This wonderful company has been in existence for 60 or 70 years and for the workers to be treated like this two or three years after it was taken over is wrong.</p>

That is under way. We understand that various Departments have made submissions to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I asked this question of the Taoiseach's predecessor and I am asking him now. Can those submissions be made available to be scrutinised in advance? I ask the question because a capital programme cannot be turned on and off easily, so we plan for a number of years ahead. In terms of some of the written replies I have received, I have concerns about certain areas. In terms of the capital review, I ask the Taoiseach that at an early date - his predecessor committed to this but it has not happened - the submissions made be published to allow this House have a proper debate on the matter.</p>

It is part of the deliberative process. It probably would not aid our efforts to come to decisions and compromises to have all those submissions in the public domain because, inevitably, Departments ask for much more than can ever be delivered and it would make it harder to have a fair outcome and a balanced compromise were all that to play out in the public domain.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">It is directly applicable, which means it will be enforced immediately in Ireland. It is complex and was the largest piece of legislation ever to emanate from the European Union. Data protection is obviously at the heart of the technology industry, multinationals and SMEs. In fact, anybody who does business keeps customer records on file and this is not to mention privacy issues, as well as the data protection and digital rights citizens must enjoy. Civic society has done great work in this area. However, if we look at the ministerial portfolios the Taoiseach created recently, data protection is fifth in line in the list of responsibilities of one Minister of State. The Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, has responsibility for jobs, trade, small business, the digital single market and data protection, which is fifth in line in what is already a fragmented and complex Department. With the best will in the world, it is difficult to see how the Minister of State can give it due attention and there are concerns within the industry that it is not receiving sufficient Government attention. It is a hugely important issue and will be a game changer across the area of commercial, scientific and data privacy issues.</p>

The averaging of contributions made over a person's lifetime has left many hugely disadvantaged but particularly women who started work early in life and took a break in the middle. We know that this is a problem that needs to be dealt with and the Taoiseach made a commitment to deal with it. How does he intend to deal with it? Are we to revert back to the way it was prior to 2012 or, if not, has the Taoiseach some other scheme that he intends to put in place? When does he intend to do so? Most importantly, what is to happen for the people in the middle, those who made the same contribution as other citizens, yet who find them themselves with a lower pension? Citizens deserve to receive the same pension as others who made the same contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">What is proposed is a move towards a new approach called the total contributions approach. It involves taking the total number of contributions made through the course of someone's working life, whether it be 35 years, 40 years or 50 years, and the pension he or she receives will be linked with the number of contributions made, not when he or she made them.

          <p eId="para_188">I refer to page 58 of the programme for Government on the issue of capacity within hospitals. The latest figures released by the INMO are very troubling, particularly for hospitals outside Dublin, in that there have been significant increases in the numbers of patients on trolleys and the level of overcrowding. More than 51,000 patients have been impacted on, including 1,695 in Naas, County Kildare, in the past six months. The figure is significantly higher than at the same time last year. It is now the summer, but it will not be that long before we will have to prepare for the winter. It is very worrying that the position is getting worse; it is certainly not getting better. What measures are the Government going to put in place, with the Minister for Health, to make sure we not find ourselves in a more difficult situation?</p>

          <p eId="para_189">The report on the bed capacity review is due in September and will inform the capital plan thereafter. Of course, the Government and the Minister are not going to wait for the report on a bed capacity review to take action.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">An additional 102 beds were brought into the system last year and 300 the year previously, and anything that can be done to increase capacity in our hospitals and reduce attendance at our hospitals will be done in the time ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I had a look at the figures, and I have always taken an interest in the area, being a medical professional and having served as Minister for Health. While overall the figures certainly show a disimprovement and underline the fact we need to do a lot more, it is interesting to see the variation from hospital to hospital. For example, according to the INMO figures Beaumont Hospital has had its lowest overcrowding since records began, and this is a hospital with an ageing population with no additional beds. Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, an area with a massively growing population, has its lowest overcrowding in ten years.</p>

          <p eId="para_217"> I hope some announcement will occur that there will be more investment in special needs assistants in the coming year. If there is, it will come with a sour taste, however, because schools are off, boards of management are not operating and teachers are not at school, meaning people do not know what is happening with the sector. Special needs assistants are worried about their jobs and parents are worried about their children. It is about a month later than last year, but this is causing huge confusion throughout the education system. Will the Taoiseach give the parents, the SNAs and schools any comfort on this matter?</p>

        <heading>Education (Regulation of Voluntary Contributions in Schools) Bill 2017: First Stage<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T15:10:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#CarolNolan" eId="spk_166">

          <p eId="para_221">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_222">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend section 12 of the Education Act 1998 and to make provision whereby the Minister for Education and Skills shall make regulations governing the voluntary contributions to recognised schools and to provide for the publication of details of the receipt and use of voluntary contributions in the annual accounts and records of schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">This short and simple Bill seeks to amend the Education Act 1998 by providing that the Minister will regulate the circumstances in which schools may seek voluntary contributions. It also provides that the receipt and expenditure of voluntary contributions shall be recorded in the annual financial records of schools. This is in keeping with recommendations made by the cross-party Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection in 2013 in its report on tackling back to school costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> The practice of schools seeking voluntary contributions has become widespread in recent years. A recent study by Barnardos showed 66% of parents of children at primary school and 79% of parents of children at secondary school are requested to pay a voluntary contribution. The average contribution is between €100 and €150 per child and the specific amount is often stipulated on the same form as the child’s enrolment information.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The same report by Barnardos stated the majority of schools pursue parents who do not pay their voluntary contribution. In some cases, reminders are sent by email, text or letters with some schools even sending reminders of requests for payment through children. The study stated in some cases the children of parents who refuse to make voluntary contributions are denied access to facilities such as lockers until the money is paid. Parents reported feeling pressured and embarrassed into paying these contributions on an annual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> It is clear from this study and, indeed, from the numerous stories I have heard from parents that the current practice is far from being voluntary and makes a mockery of our so-called free education system. I fully accept the austerity policies of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have had a significant impact on schools. I know from my time as a school principal that there were significant and unnecessary cuts. Capitation rates have been slashed by 11% since 2008. This has led to a massive shortfall and schools being put under tremendous pressure. Schools are struggling to pay for essential basic services such as lighting and heat. They are relying on the generosity and goodwill of parents to make up the shortfall in funding to meet these basic costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> However, it should not have to be parents and children who pay the price for bad government policy that has refused to tackle this issue. In many cases, parents and children simply do not have the means to make these levels of contributions to schools. An Irish League of Credit Unions survey states 31% of parents get into debt to cover back to school costs. Figures have shown that the rate of children experiencing consistent poverty has almost doubled between 2008 and 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> This Bill seeks to strike a balance between the right of schools to accept voluntary contributions to make up the shortfall in funding and the realities for many parents who simply cannot afford them. The Bill states schools must clearly state that any contribution by parents to the operating costs of the school is voluntary and there is no obligation on parents to provide such a contribution. It seeks to ensure schools may only contact a parent about voluntary contributions once per school year and may not make further contact in any form to request payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> The Bill seeks to ensure no child will be treated differently in terms of access to school facilities as result of the fact his or her parents chose not to make a contribution to the school. It also seeks to effectively end the seeking of voluntary contributions once capitation levels are restored to adequate levels by the Government. I have called on the Minister several times to ensure capitation levels are restored as soon as possible. The Bill further provides the receipt and expenditure of voluntary contributions will be published in the annual accounts of the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The Bill makes a genuine attempt to address an issue that is of fundamental concern to parents. I commend it to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_239">The Cabinet committee on regional and rural affairs last met on 9 May 2017. The Government will shortly make a decision to re-establish more streamlined Cabinet committee structures. The Cabinet committee on regional and rural affairs was established to co-ordinate the work of Departments that affect rural Ireland. Its main focus has been on the preparation and implementation of the action plan for rural development which was published in January. The action plan contains 276 actions for delivery across government, State agencies and other bodies to support improved quality of life, economic activity and public service delivery across Ireland's rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_240"> Good progress has been achieved since the action plan was launched and an interim progress report was submitted to the Cabinet committee and published in May. It identifies progress in areas, including the provision of rural broadband, a €20 million investment in the town and village renewal scheme, 500 additional places for the rural social scheme and establishment of the Atlantic economic corridor task force. One pillar of the action plan is to support enterprise and employment in all regions, with the objective of creating 135,000 extra jobs outside Dublin by 2020. While there are still disparities between areas, the quarter one figures from the CSO show that 77% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin and that the unemployment rate had fallen in all regions in the past year. The new Minister for Rural and Community Development now has responsibility for leading implementation of the action plan and the first formal six-monthly progress report is due to be published in July.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_241">The decision at the weekend by the British Government to exit the London Fisheries Convention will have serious implications for the Irish fishing industry. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade tells us that he only heard about it through the media. Was no one in government forewarned about this action? The British stance is obviously part of the hard Brexit Ms Theresa May appears to be absolutely determined to pursue. </p>
            <p eId="para_242"> According to 2015 figures released by the British, about 10,000 tonnes of fish were caught by other countries under the London Fisheries Convention, worth an estimated £17 million. Can the Taoiseach state how much of that figure was caught by Irish boats operating from this State? The potential consequences for the rural communities that depend on fishing are enormous, as we all accept. Has the Government raised this matter with Mr. Michel Barnier and the EU negotiating team? Will the Taoiseach stress to our EU partners the economic importance of fishing to the Irish economy and the need for EU support for those communities that will be affected by these British decisions? Will he agree to hold a debate in the Dáil on this matter before the recess? Will he instruct the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to appear before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to outline the measures the Government intends to take to protect the livelihoods of Irish fishermen, fisherwomen and families? Rural communities and families are also under threat from the announcement made last week by European Commissioner Günther Oettinger of farm subsidies certainly facing cuts as Brexit will leave a black hole in the EU budget. The Commissioner said reductions under the CAP were likely. Has the Government spoken to the Commission about these matters? Has Commissioner Hogan given any information to the Government on these proposals? The European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Ms Corina Creu, has also warned that governments will have to consider topping up direct payments to farmers. Is the Taoiseach prepared to sanction this?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_175">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_243">When the re-establishment of a Department of community and rural affairs was announced three weeks ago, no details were provided on what its responsibilities would be. There has since been near-complete silence. In the Taoiseach's leadership manifesto there is very little detail on rural affairs, with the programme simply promising to implement existing policies. It is clear that the Department of Deputy Michael Ring will be significantly smaller than that of its predecessor before it was abolished by Fine Gael six years ago. I believe that was an incorrect decision. Development schemes for the Gaeltacht and the islands have been left to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under Deputy Heather Humphreys. Nothing appears to have moved from the Department of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten. Drugs policy is remaining under the Department of Health. The last point indicates a highly regressive move and decision. In the past two decades, the major progress made in drugs policy was based on working with communities, partnerships and task forces in various areas, both urban and rural, through development work and schemes, particularly for young people at risk. That was a far more effective way of dealing with drugs policy and implementing a draft strategy than operating singularly through the Department of Health.</p>
            <p eId="para_244"> On Leader programme funding, the last Government performed a desperate deed against rural communities by savaging the Leader programme and taking autonomy away from leadership groups and subsuming it under the county council. It is now bedevilled by over-regulation and bureaucracy such that the reduced funds available to it cannot be drawn down by many of the groups involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> The implementation of broadband policy has been an absolute failure in rural areas. I echo what has been said about the challenges facing fisheries and agriculture arising from Brexit. These are two of the main economic pillars of rural areas.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_176">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_246">I wish to focus on two areas, the first being broadband. Most people outside the major cities were profoundly worried about the impact of the delay in the rolling out of broadband. Obviously, I was directly involved in the previous Administration in examining this issue and setting out clearly what would be commercially available and the areas in which the State had to step in. We had every expectation that the tender would have been out by now to fill the gap in order that provision would be made for the entire country, to be completed in the next 18 months or so, but we have not even got to analysis stage to determine what the tender will look like. This is a really important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_247"> My second question relates to regional rebalancing. The Taoiseach has been around the country campaigning to be leader of his party. He will know, just as I know from travelling around the country, that there is a real need for somebody with a big idea, the big idea of rebalancing the country. Bluntly, that will not be done with the rural plan we have of making sure every county receives something. We need to have concrete action to have a focus on the mid-west, the south and west to rebalance away from the east in order that not all economic activity will be sucked into the east. Considering that the Taoiseach is a big admirer of both the Canadian Prime Minister, whom he is hosting today, and the French President, Mr. Macron, who present themselves as big ideas persons, does he have a view on developing a big idea to have true regional rebalancing in the State?</p>

            <p eId="para_248">With regard to fisheries, to the best of my knowledge, we were not given any prior notice of the UK Government's notification that it intended to withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention. As I mentioned earlier, it has no immediate effect, as withdrawal takes about two years. In reality, it will get tied up with the Brexit negotiations, which of course involve the UK leaving the Common Fisheries Policy as well, should it proceed with Brexit as it plans. Some 35% of the fish we land is taken from UK waters, including some of the most valuable fish such as mackerel and prawn. As I mentioned, I was not aware that we take so much valuable fish from British waters. I had often heard the reverse being spoken about but had not heard so much about what we take from UK waters.</p>

            <p eId="para_250">With regard to debates, I am scheduling them as a matter for the Business Committee, but Sinn Féin is free to use its time to discuss fisheries or marine matters at any time it so wishes. When it comes to committees, invitations are issued by the committees and not by me. We have of course discussed issues relating to fisheries and the reform of the CAP with both Commissioner Hogan and Mr. Michel Barnier. In addition to that, the Minister, Deputy Creed, has been working closely with counterparts in other EU member states with a particular interest in fishing in the north-western waters. We plan to have a united front and a common negotiating position for Ireland as part of the European Union during this period. The Minister, Deputy Creed, will be speaking to the UK Secretary of State, Michael Gove, this week about this and other priority issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_251"> With regard to the new Department of rural and community development, the Department will be taking the rural affairs and regional development section from the Department of arts, heritage and Gaeltacht, and the community section from the Department of Housing, Community, Planning and Local Government. Also, it will most likely take the charity sector from the Department of Justice and Equality. The new Department will not be taking Gaeltacht affairs. That will remain in the Department of arts, culture and the Gaeltacht, with its name still to be finalised. What is being recreated there is the Department that existed in 1997, when it was originally created under President Higgins. It will be slightly smaller than the previous Department, but that is mainly because the Gaeltacht portfolio is not going to be a part of the Department of rural and community development. An interim Secretary General has now been appointed. Work is under way to get that Department up and running. There is much important work to be done there.</p>
            <p eId="para_252"> Like many things, one could place something like drugs in many Departments and could associate it with justice, education, health or community. My view is that drugs and addiction are health issues and that the best place for drugs is in the Department of Health and not the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of community affairs. Of course, that is a matter of opinion. I am also conscious that the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is now finalising the new national drugs strategy. Therefore, I thought it appropriate to allow her to finish that work and to finish it in the Department of Health and not to disrupt things by moving that area of policy to a different Department. What is more important than which Department it is in is that the work gets done and the new strategy is produced and implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_253"> With regard to Deputy Howlin's question on regional development, I noted that he mentioned the mid-west, the south and the west, but not the south east. I am not sure whether that was an oversight on his part-----</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_180">

            <p eId="para_255">-----as to whether he believes the south east should be left out as we focus on development in other regions such as the mid-west, the south and the west, which he mentioned. </p>
            <p eId="para_256"> Two things are in development that I believe will have a big impact on rebalancing our country and ensuring there are alternative poles of development to Dublin. One of those is Ireland 2040, the spatial plan that is now advanced and being developed by the Minister, Deputy Murphy. The other is the new capital plan. Key to ensuring that all regions in all parts of the country have the opportunity to benefit from prosperity is to make sure that they have the infrastructure they need. I expect that to include extending and improving the road network in various parts of the country, such as between Cork and Limerick and into the north west, and continuing to invest in broadband. However, I believe there are limitations to how far Government policy can take us when it comes to these issues. Certainly, what we can see is a recovery that is taking hold all over the country. We see that in the employment numbers going up in every region, the unemployment numbers going down in every region and income stats improving in every region. It is also very evident that we need to accelerate the recovery and economic development in parts of the country that have not benefited to the extent that others have. That makes sense for many reasons, not least the fact that Dublin is becoming congested and price inflation is very much affecting this city. Therefore, it is to this city's advantage that there would be more balanced regional development. I hope that those two plans will help to bring us some of the way there.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_182">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_263">I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 7, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_264"> Under A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to holding constitutional referenda on the following matters: Article 41.2.1°, regarding a woman's life within the home; Article 40.6.1°, on the offence of blasphemy; giving the Office of Ceann Comhairle constitutional standing; and Ireland's participation in the Unified Patent Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_265"> Three of these proposals arise from the Convention on the Constitution that sat from January 2013 to February 2014. The Government has responded to all the convention's reports. One of the convention's recommendations, of particular importance, is in relation to amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections. In March of this year, Government approved, in principle, to the holding of this referendum and the Minister for Housing, Community and Local Government is now working on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_266"> In addition, A Programme for a Partnership Government committed the Government to establish a Citizens' Assembly with a mandate to look at a limited number of key issues, including the eighth amendment to the Constitution. In July 2016, the Houses of the Oireachtas approved establishment of the assembly. </p>
            <p eId="para_267"> The assembly is chaired by former Supreme Court Judge, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy. It operates independently of Government and will report directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The assembly has concluded its deliberations on the first topic, the eighth amendment, and published its report on the matter only last Thursday and laid it before the Houses. The Houses will now refer it for consideration to the recently established Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment under the chairmanship of Senator Catherine Noone, which will in turn bring its conclusions to the Houses for debate. As I have already indicated, it is my intention to hold a referendum on this matter in 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_268"> A Programme for a Partnership Government also says that on foot of the recommendation of the banking inquiry, the Government will seek a review of the powers of Oireachtas committees in conducting inquiries and, based on this review, will consider whether there should be a constitutional referendum to strengthen the power of Oireachtas committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_269"> Aside from a referendum on the eighth amendment taking place next year, no decision has been made yet as regards timing for other planned referenda. Before any referendum would be scheduled, I will of course bring a proposal to Government and hold discussions with Opposition leaders.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_183">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_270">The Taoiseach has said that the Government will hold a referendum on the eight amendment next year. Can the Taoiseach please be more specific than that? We need a reassurance that the referendum will be put to the people early next year. It would be most welcome if the Taoiseach clarified that matter in the House this afternoon. The convention did, as the Taoiseach said, deliberate on matters and produced a report that I believe is broadly reflective and chimes with public opinion, broadly cast, right across the country. There is no doubt that there is now a level of public impatience with the Taoiseach's ongoing failure to deal with this issue. I know the Taoiseach will cite the committee and how it is up and running, but there now needs to be a sense of urgency around all this.</p>
            <p eId="para_271"> There was a revelation several weeks ago that a young girl who had requested a termination when reporting suicidal ideation due to an unwanted pregnancy was instead falsely imprisoned under the Mental Health Act. It is an absolutely appalling and shocking thing. That appalling situation echoed the experience of Ms Amanda Mellett. Last summer, the United Nations ruled that the State had failed her and that she had suffered discrimination and cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment. She is by no means alone in that experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_272"> The Taoiseach has made the commitment to the referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_273">That is to be welcomed. We now need to know when it will be held and we need to be reassured that there will be no further foot dragging. </p>
            <p eId="para_274"> In respect of the extension of voting rights, we must bear in mind it is limited to presidential elections. This matter was also deliberated on by the constitutional convention. Its view was crystal clear and yet we are waiting and waiting. Notwithstanding the work of the Minister, when will this matter be put to the people?</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_275">I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to hold a referendum in 2018. Given the timeline of the Oireachtas committee, which has a number of months in which to do its work, whatever further deliberations the Taoiseach may decide are required in terms of these Houses and the actual preparation of the referendum, it would be highly desirable if the Taoiseach could commit to holding the referendum shortly after March and perhaps before the middle of June 2018. It is appropriate for it to be held then because it should not become embroiled in the visit of the Pope to Ireland towards the end of the summer. We want a respectful debate. It is a very difficult personal issue for huge numbers of people. The people who campaign on the "ultra" sides of either side may have very clear and shrill views but many citizens will want the opportunity to come to their conclusions about what is the most appropriate option. I agree with what has been said, namely, that there has been a sea change in people's attitudes in this area. I want to make it clear that the Labour Party wishes to see the repeal of the existing constitutional amendment, which was passed over 30 years ago. Younger people in particular want their opportunity to vote on that as soon as is practically possible. My view is that it should be early in the second quarter of next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_276">I also welcome the clear commitment to have a referendum on the eighth amendment during the course of 2018. I do not want to rehearse or repeat matters that have already been raised by my colleague with which I strongly agree. However, I wish to get some clarification from the Taoiseach. I do not think anybody on any side of the House believes that this Dáil will last a full five-year term or anything like it. I would like to get some sense of what other issues are prioritised in the list given by the Taoiseach. He has given us a list of matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_277"> In respect of the Taoiseach's view on holding more than one referendum on the same day, which he will recall was debated in the Government of which he and I were both members, it was his predecessor's view that one could have a referendum day to address a number of issues. However, I think it is clear that on matters of substance, one cannot have the kind of focus and debate if there are a number of issues to be addressed. Some issues get put to one side and focused on at the last minute and we do not get a rounded debate on them. I would be interested in hearing the Taoiseach's view on two matters. What is his view on multi-referenda days? If he is of the view that they must be taken on a stand-alone basis, in reality, we will only have one referendum by the end of next year and probably in the lifetime of this Dáil. Where does this leave two matters, one of which is the issue of emigrant voting rights? We have a Minister of State for the diaspora and a Minister of State for electoral reform and I understand that we now have a special envoy for the undocumented Irish, so plenty of jobs have been given out but are we going to proceed on that matter? The Taoiseach has not raised the issue of Seanad reform, which was a matter for a referendum. Where are we in terms of what we do next? </p>

            <p eId="para_278">Today, the Taoiseach and the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, were touting their support for the CETA agreement, an agreement that could result in thousands of job losses, fundamentally undermine workers' rights, subvert environmental protections and, crucially, undermine the sovereignty of the legal system and the Constitution in this country and countries across Europe. Bizarrely, much of the coverage of the Taoiseach's meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau focused on things like the pattern of the Taoiseach's socks and his youthfulness when this deal has hugely significant and potentially very damaging consequences for our economy and the sovereignty of our legal system. A wide range of NGOs and legal experts are saying that, effectively, this deal is illegal for European states because it will undermine their legal systems. Does the Taoiseach not think that it is wrong for us to go along with the provisional application of this corporate, globalisation-style agreement without a democratic process - a referendum - and some democratic input into whether or not we sign up to this agreement rather than just provisionally applying it, as the lingo goes, over the heads of this Parliament and the people of this country?</p>

            <p eId="para_279">I am glad that there is now a commitment to hold a referendum on the eighth amendment in 2018. The question is what kind of referendum it will be. I hope it will be one that respects the findings of the Citizens' Assembly, which this Dáil established against the advice of many of us. It came up with a decision to trust women. I also hope that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution will be respected and that the parallel process we are hearing about in the media will wait for the committee to give its verdict.</p>
            <p eId="para_280"> The Citizens' Assembly was set up by the Dáil. It has come up with a position of trusting women. That position is beyond what most of the parties in this Dáil are in favour of - bar Solidarity-People Before Profit and probably a handful of other individuals in this Dáil. Given that the Dáil is more conservative than the wider public, I hope the public will not be prevented from at least having a say on those proposals. How could this be done? We need a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment. It is vital that we remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution and not police women's bodies or health in our Constitution. Would the Taoiseach be open to the idea of a second vote - a consultative vote - where people could have a say on the options put forward by the Citizens' Assembly? This would be a plebiscite. Generally, we do not hold plebiscites in this country but a plebiscite was considered with regard to water charges and public ownership of water. Otherwise, people may not get an opportunity to have a say on those progressive proposals. The pro-choice movement, the repeal movement, young people and women would campaign for a "Yes" vote to all of those options. That would give people a democratic say on what are historic proposals rather than the Dáil possibly coming up with a more restrictive proposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_281">The fact that there have been more public consultations on the content of referenda is a positive development. The referendum to abolish the Seanad failed because it was seen as a party political objective as opposed to one that was necessarily good for the country. The people saw sense in terms of maintaining a second, Upper, House to have the proper articulation of views, views independent of the Government in many instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_282"> In respect of the eighth amendment, it seems that the key determinant is the Oireachtas committee that has just been established in terms of both the timing and the content. Let us be honest. The content will be central to whatever proposition is ultimately put to the people. There will be varying degrees of interest around the committee. That will be the challenging part in terms of the process and a workable proposition to be put to the people because it is an issue on which the people deserve to be consulted and have their say. The precise nature of the question will be the difficult part of this. It was our view all along that we wanted this to be considered by the Oireachtas in advance of the Citizens' Assembly.</p>
            <p eId="para_283">We would have preferred for the Oireachtas to start working on it much earlier. As it is, we now have the recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly. The Oireachtas committee will have to work on that and then the issue has to be put to the people.</p>
            <p eId="para_284"> The Taoiseach mentioned the European patent court as necessitating a potential referendum. That is economically important and I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could indicate to me what the up-to-date position is. Has the Government set priority on the other referendums that the Taoiseach identified and referred to, apart from for one on the eighth amendment?</p>

We thrive when we have a free trade environment globally. That has been the fundamental change in Ireland's industrial and economic history from the late 1950s and the 1960s to the current day.</p>

            <p eId="para_290">There are a number of matters to speak to there. Everyone in this House has been involved in a number of referendums and we all know what is required to have a referendum. First, there needs to be wording, even if that wording is as simple as "delete the following sentence", so that has to be agreed with regard to all of these referendums. Secondly, there needs to be legislation. While it probably is not needed, it is advisable so that people know what legislation is going to come into force if an amendment is made. We did that for divorce and for marriage equality. I imagine we would also have to publish legislation so that people know what the new law is before they vote on the amendment. An electoral commission also has to be established, and electoral commissions will want a certain amount of time. We have faced complaints from electoral commissions before, telling Government that it was rushing a referendum and that it did not give the electoral commission enough time. We have also had court cases on campaigns and the validity of referendums as a result of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_291"> When it comes to a referendum on abortion, on the eighth amendment, I have no interest in long-fingering it. This issue has been discussed for a very long time and I think people should have their say. If it is possible to have it done before the summer of next year, I would have no difficulty with that, but I do not want to make a commitment in the House here that that is possible and then suddenly have to come back into the House in March and April and say that it cannot be done for various reasons. The first step is the Oireachtas committee completing its deliberations. The Citizens' Assembly report was only formally published last week and I understand the committee is not going to have its proper hearings until September, so I expect it will be near to the end of the year before it is able to advise us on the potential wording of legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_292"> I will explain the parallel process. It is not an attempt to circumvent the Citizens' Assembly or to circumvent what is happening at the Oireachtas committee. Rather, I have asked the Attorney General and the Department of Health to pay attention to what the Citizens' Assembly has recommended and to pay attention to the deliberations that are going to be happening in the Oireachtas committee, so that if and when the Oireachtas committee makes its report, perhaps at the end of November or December, it does not suddenly arrive on the desk of the Attorney General or Minister for Health and have them asking what it is all about. I want them to pay attention to what the Citizens' Assembly has recommended and to what the committee deliberates on so that we are ready to have a referendum in 2018. If it can be done in the first half of 2018, that is fine with me, but I do not want to make that commitment without knowing that is possible, because I do not want to make a commitment that I might not be able to honour.</p>
            <p eId="para_293"> On the promised referendums, there are many potentially in train. There is also one on divorce, with Deputy Josepha Madigan having a Bill to liberalise our divorce laws. There are potential referendums on blasphemy, on the patent court, which is slightly in abeyance now because we do not know what the UK is going to do but that does not mean we should not go ahead with it, extending the vote on the Presidency to citizens abroad, women in the home, the eighth amendment and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle. There is much in train. I do not yet know myself which should come first and which should not, but my sense is that the greatest public demand and potential impact on people's lives is from the eighth amendment and the votes for the Presidency for citizens overseas, though for that one, even if we have the referendum in 2018, is not going to be in place for the presidential election, for all sorts of reasons. It would apply to the presidential election after that.</p>
            <p eId="para_294"> What I would be interested in knowing from the House today and perhaps sitting down with the main party leaders in the weeks ahead is to hear their views and perhaps agree some sort of schedule of referendums. I am not totally averse to the idea of several on one day. I see the upsides and downsides. We have opportunities and potentially a referendum day of some sort in the first half of next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_304">It is the Taoiseach's intention to continue the practice of chairing all of the Cabinet committees. That is interesting to know. The function of these committees is to ensure that policy is developed and implemented which reflects the Government's programme for Government. This system and the time restrictions which are simply implemented really do not afford us the latitude to question all of those matters in the way that we might. There is also the issue of Cabinet confidentiality and I recognise its necessity and value, but it is difficult to get under the bonnet of these committees as they similarly enjoy that privilege. Has the Taoiseach considered not just the establishment of Cabinet committees, but the workings of them and better mechanisms to report back here to the Dáil for scrutiny by all of us?</p>

            <p eId="para_305">During the recent Fine Gael leadership campaign, the media was told that the Taoiseach intended to make "radical" transformative changes to the nature and role of Cabinet committees. From what I have heard, the most radical move seems to be to get rid of some of them or to bury them altogether. The Taoiseach may have reason for that. I have a question on some Cabinet committees. If one looks at the last Government in the last five years, the Cabinet committee on health has been an outstanding failure. This is the committee that cleared a White Paper, which had no costs or implementation schedules and was ultimately abandoned within two years of its publication, on universal health insurance. It insisted that HSE service plans would commit to levels of service that were impossible to deliver with the provided funding. To put it bluntly, there is a huge question mark around the Cabinet committee on health and how it works, and indeed others as well, particularly on housing. The help-to-buy scheme was launched with great fanfare last year. The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, was entirely confident about it. He was warned that it would inflate house prices. Ultimately, the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, agreed with Deputy Michael McGrath to a review of that. We learned within 12 months that the new Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has a very negative view of the help-to-buy scheme and is contemplating its abolition.</p>
            <p eId="para_306">I take the Taoiseach's point that he will either reduce the Cabinet subcommittees in size or have fewer of them, but it is difficult to ascertain how effective they have been in terms of decisive policy interventions that have made a difference to the biggest crises that are facing the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_307">Notwithstanding that there have been policy failures in multiple areas by this Government, the principle of Cabinet subcommittees is a good one because it allows for joined-up thinking between different Departments. I want to ask again about the need for a Cabinet subcommittee in the area of education. We did not have one in the previous Government and it is critical that we have one for multiple reasons. There are a lot of controversial issues emerging. Education, it goes without saying, is a very important area.</p>
            <p eId="para_308"> In particular, as I have said to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Skills, there is a very serious threat to the facilities of schools throughout the country because of religious control of schools and school lands. To my mind, playing pitches and recreational areas around school are not an optional extra. They are critical for all sorts of health reasons and to allow for the expansion of schools, and yet we have discovered in many schools, such as Clonkeen College in my own area, religious orders are flogging off their lands at the expense of the quality of the education and amenities provided to school students. The Government is letting it happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_309"> There needs to be a serious policy discussion at a high level within the Government about the threat this represents to school facilities. I have said I believe that compulsory purchase powers have to be used to prevent the religious orders, which are accountable to nobody, flogging off playing fields and recreational areas for schools all over the country. I would ask the Taoiseach to seriously consider that instead of merely saying it is nothing to do with the Government, the religious orders are private entities and the Government does not have any control. This is what we are getting and it is a threat to the quality of the education that is available to our young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_330">I intend to change it. I expect there will be fewer Cabinet subcommittees, probably, approximately five. There will be an economic focused one, one focused on public services and social policy, another on EU affairs and international affairs, another on infrastructure and housing, and probably, we will retain a dedicated one on health given the high priority that will be attached to that. I will have many fewer people attending them, meeting in different formats.</p>
            <p eId="para_331"> I am also doing a lot more on a bilateral level. For example, yesterday I met bilaterally with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, their Secretary General and their adviser. I also met the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on disability issues with his three Secretary Generals. I will be doing that a lot more - meeting bilaterally with Ministers to try and drive the agenda and get things done.</p>
            <p eId="para_332"> I will also have longer Cabinet meetings. For example, there will be two Cabinet meetings next week because there will be a special Cabinet meeting to deal with the summer economic statement. Something like that deserves full consideration by the Cabinet for two or three hours, and not being one of 28 or 50 items at a regular meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_333"> There will also be full-day Cabinet meetings. The first full-day Cabinet meeting will deal with climate change and the Government's actions on that in the morning and then the capital plan in the afternoon.</p>
            <p eId="para_334"> Those are the kind of changes that I intend to make. We will see how they work out. The key is to troubleshoot problems and drive the agenda, and that is what I will try and do.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Katherine Zappone)<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_337">Along with the Deputy and other Deputies, I very much welcome the report by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon which is an audit of the use of section 12 by An Garda Síochána. He has done a great service to children. He has also done monumental work in terms of what we as policy makers need to do in order to support children in crisis. His report is a comprehensive, thorough analysis of the strengths and deficiencies in our shared approach to child protection. As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I will apply this research to our child protection system.</p>
            <p eId="para_338"> Since the publication of the report I have met Dr. Shannon on two occasions and have had several other communications with him. He has also had intensive engagement with officials in my Department. He has been very generous with his time and his expertise. Together, we have identified an action plan to improve our emergency child protection services.</p>
            <p eId="para_339"> Specifically, Deputy Rabbitte has asked me about establishing a 24 hour social work service. Following the discussions with Dr. Shannon, the initial steps have been agreed as to how best to implement the recommendation. I have already requested that Tusla examine, as a matter of priority, the level of demand for such a service and identify the most appropriate and child-friendly manner in which supports can be provided when a child needs emergency out-of-hours care. We can probably all agree that the needs of younger children and older adolescents will be different. We need to have a system that recognises this and responds to these differing needs and circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_340"> Last week, I attended a public consultation in the Seanad on mental health services for children. I listened to the testimony of mothers who described the chronic challenges faced by them when they need an urgent out-of-hours emergency service. In my opinion, we need an out-of-hours emergency service which responds to the needs of all children. We need the right response, from the right services at the right time. This should be flexible enough to meet the needs of the individual child and the particular situation. It could involve An Garda Síochána, Tusla social workers, HSE psychiatric professionals and HSE medical teams.</p>

            <p eId="para_341">I suppose I am a little at sea in one of the questions I am asking the Minister. What piece of information is missing from Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report? The information is not there. He has written this in the here and now, for example, he wrote in 2014, 2015 and was compiling it up to 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_342">Tusla put in place an out-of-hours service which the report acknowledges is in place. However, while Dr. Shannon was compiling the end of the report, he found serious gaps, including those associated with the 91 cases referenced. What part of the report that is missing suggests we do not need a 24-hour service? What gives a child in rural Ireland, or any part of Ireland, a lesser right to access to a social service worker than a child from any of the other four counties? No child should be denied that right. The Minister is right: Dr. Geoffrey Shannon has produced a comprehensive report. It is probably one of the leading worldwide reports carried out, yet we are saying we do not have enough information.</p>

            <p eId="para_343">I indicated in response to the Deputy's question my view on the recommendation of Dr. Shannon which I have agreed to include in my implementation plan. I have asked Tusla to take the first steps. This has been agreed with Dr. Shannon on the most appropriate way to move forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_344"> The Deputy is aware that we have an out-of-hours service. The Garda has access to a telephone line and live social workers when section 12 is invoked for children in counties Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_345"> It has been agreed with Dr. Shannon that the most appropriate way to begin the process of responding to his recommendation is to ask Tusla to set out the level of demand by county and age. Most of the demand seems to be in these areas. We need to know whether enough staff are in place and, if not, whether Tusla could add additional social care staff. That is one of the questions. In areas outside counties Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork seven social workers are available to be called. They receive calls from the national telephone service. It is true that they only go out in situations involving parental death, car crashes, mass tragedy and other special circumstances. In that sense, the service is restricted, but the threshold is being examined in the light of what I have requested Tusla to do. The key is seeing where the demand is and what types of situation and children are involved in order for us to respond appropriately.</p>

            <p eId="para_346">I acknowledge that considerable work has been done. The implementation plan agreed with Tusla last week was welcome. I am keen to see the timelines and the reviews to be completed. When will we know the county by county details in respect of the data contained on page 50 of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report? Do we have a timeline in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_347"> Reference was made to 23 social care workers possibly being required to work in strategic divisions within An Garda Síochána. Do we have a timeline in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_348"> Time is of the essence. If we do not put timelines in place, we will encounter problems. Dr. Shannon has invited himself back to the Oireachtas committee next year to indicate how we are making progress. Has the Department of Children and Youth Affairs put timelines in place for delivery in the next 12 months? We need measurable targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_349">I have asked those responsible to begin the work and report back to me as soon as possible on the different sections of the implementation plan relating to Tusla's response to Dr. Shannon's report. For example, in respect of the out-of-hours service, on which the Deputy's question focuses, my officials will be meeting representatives of Tusla towards the end of this week to begin the process of looking at page 50, as well as additional issues that, no doubt, are being raised about the table Dr. Shannon has produced. As I said, he has agreed that it is important to do a little more detailed work in that regard to respond appropriately or make recommendations to me to develop an out-of-hours service.</p>
            <p eId="para_350"> I tried to indicate in my initial response to the Deputy's question my vision.

            <p eId="para_355">Thank you. I appreciate and accept your condolences. It helps me during this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_356"> As stated in my previous reply to Deputy Anne Rabbitte, I have developed an implementation plan to address the recommendations made by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon relating to Tusla. They have been agreed with him and are being implemented without delay. Several recommendations relate to the practice and procedures for seeking and using emergency care orders under section 13 of the Child Care Act 1991 to which the Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire has referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_357"> Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire will be aware of one point, but I believe it is important to highlight it. It was not within Dr. Shannon's terms of reference to review Tusla's actions in his recent report. However, I am strongly of the opinion that, based on the work carried out by him, the next logical step is to conduct a detailed study of how section 13 is implemented by Tusla. I have asked it to commission suitably qualified and experienced researchers to examine this issue in detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_358"> The research will examine the children's experience of being received, out of normal working hours, into Tusla custody. It will examine Tusla's decision-making process in deciding whether to apply for an emergency care order under section 13. I have asked that the research examine the reasons when a decision is made to return a child to the home from which he or she was removed by the Garda. This was the subject of much commentary. I think it is important that we understand why these decisions are made. The research will also identify where children have been the subject of repeated section 12 interventions and examine the reasons behind them.</p>
            <p eId="para_359"> I believe the research will provide clarity on the realities for children when sections 12 and 13 are invoked to protect them. The examination of the operation of section 13 will provide an understanding of the reasons staff initiated the actions. It is important that the research and the findings be regarded as a positive and constructive exercise to show us what is working and what is not. First and foremost, the purpose is to help us to provide the best possible response for children when they are taken into the custody of Tusla in emergencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_360">I thank the Minister for her response. I will return to that aspect of the matter. As the Minister is aware, we have had debates at the committee in recent weeks. Mr. McBride and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon were before it. Several differences in emphasis and perhaps in detail emerged in the contributions made by both gentlemen to the committee. I wish to flag some particular issues about which I want to ask the Minister specifically. Is she committed to implementing the recommendations of the Shannon report? The big issue in terms of the discrepancies in the report was the lack of a proper 24-hour service. The answer cannot simply be the provision of a telephone line. I believe it is possible to provide such a service and it should not be dictated by demand. Much of the exercise has already been carried out in respect of where the demand is.</p>
            <p eId="para_361"> Will the Minister tackle the excessive reliance on private placement organisations that have the ability to refuse children? One consequence of this practice is that we see children still being referred to this day to Garda stations. That is entirely unsuitable. What will the Minister do to ensure the inter-agency co-operation which was described as poor and superficial can be improved?</p>

            <p eId="para_362">As I indicated, I put in place a comprehensive response to the recommendations made in Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report as a result of meetings and an agreement with him on the initial way to proceed in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_363"> Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire's last question was on inter-agency co-operation. Several aspects in this regard will be examined and reported on to me in ensuring better inter-agency co-operation. In particular, we will examine the Garda and Tusla and what is going on in terms of the strategic liaison committees, the membership of which comprises representatives of the Garda and Tusla.</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> Another question was related to co-location and whether we needed the physical presence of gardaí and Tusla staff working together.</p>
            <p eId="para_365">Initially, co-location will be piloted, following which consideration will be given to how it can work better such that in other settings, including at national level, we can have a co-location of Tusla and Garda to ensure a better response to the children invoked in terms of section 12.</p>

            <p eId="para_366">I recognise that Tusla's job is difficult and that it inherited a difficult situation. As I have previously noted, we have an unhappy history of child protection in this State. Issues are still regularly being raised in regard to weaknesses in our child protection services. For this reason, I called some weeks ago in this House for a full audit of the child protection system.</p>
            <p eId="para_367"> I noted with interest an announcement on the airwaves of a review or a piece of research into the section 13 cases. I welcome this. I believe we need a transformation of our child protection services and a roadmap along the lines of A Vision for Change to achieve it. In regard to the independent research, I believe it should be independent of Tusla and that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs should have oversight of it. It must have access to social work files, Courts Service reports, where relevant, and it should have a broad terms of reference, with the potential to expand beyond section 13 cases, if necessary and appropriate. Also, Tusla should not have a veto over its recommendations. That is important. Is this the type of audit the Minister envisages?</p>

            <p eId="para_368">Yes, and it will be independent. The progress of commissioning the independent research has already commenced. I agree with Deputy Ó Laoghaire that in terms of understanding social work decision-making it would be helpful to have social work input. The chair of the board of Tusla has responded to my request to commission that independent piece of research and is currently putting it in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_369"> In regard to the Deputy's call for a wider audit, there are two points I would like to make. It is important to note that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has inspected all of the Tusla child protection services, including how social workers' respond to children in emergency. All actions identified by HIQA are being implemented. HIQA and Tusla report any outstanding issues to my Department. All of their inspections reports are published. In regard to the statutory investigation that I directed HIQA to have carried out under section 9 of the Health Act, the Deputy should look again at the terms of reference as they relate to the handling of child sex abuse allegations, which at my request provide that if in the course of that piece of research there are reasonable grounds to believe that there are further or other serious risks to children or persons receiving services these should be reported to HIQA or to me as Minister. There are many ways in respect of which Tusla is currently under scrutiny, some of which were put in place by me. I must wait until these have been completed and reported to me, when I will then consider what further action might be necessary.</p>

In addition, there will be targeted child care supports for those who need it most. In particular, I want to offer support to parents who cannot take up work, training or education because they cannot afford child care.

            <p eId="para_375"> Despite the changes in September, some of which I referred to in regard to the affordable child care scheme, there are still challenges to delivery of the new scheme. Developing the high-tech part of our new approach is not easy. As well as technical issues, there are data protection and other legal requirements which must be met. The systems we are building now will last generations. We simply cannot afford to get this wrong. Strong progress is being made and I will update Deputies as we progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_376"> When it comes to our children there can be no compromise on safety. Parents must be assured that their children are being cared for in a safe environment. For this reason, the financial supports on offer can only go to those providers where quality is assured. The affordable child care scheme will be delivered through Tusla-registered providers, centre-based or childminders. A report has been requested from an expert group on how the childminding sector can be developed to meet appropriate quality standards. This report will inform future policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_377"> I acknowledge Deputies' support and their input. I hope I will continue to have their support as I seek more child care funding in budget 2018.</p>

            <p eId="para_378">I thank the Minister. I, too, acknowledge that this is not an easy process. This time last year, I asked the Minister for an update on the ICT system. I understand roll-out of this scheme is being held up because it is not up to standard. What is the status of the ICT project at this point, which was supposed to be in place for August 2018. What is the current timeline in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_379"> I understand that 70,000 children will benefit under this scheme but that there are 9,000 families which do not make the cut in terms of eligibility for it. These families do not qualify for the GP services card either. What is the Department doing to assist the 9,000 families who will lose out on €12 per week? What is being done to assist that sector?</p>

            <p eId="para_380">I thank Deputy Rabbitte for her questions, which provide me with an opportunity to clarify the situation. In regard to the 9,000 families which may not be able to participate in the full affordable child care scheme vision, which we hope will be the best in the world and will be less expensive, the figure of 9,000 is an estimate. We are being upfront and honest in terms of our first effort to put in place mechanisms through which parents can access substantially more subsidies as and from September 2017. It is important to get that message out. For parents wishing to determine to what extent they can access those subsidies all the information in that regard is available on <i>www.affordablechildcare.ie. </i>We have initiated a huge information campaign for parents. We are also travelling the country with a roadshow to ensure providers have that information. As we move towards the roll-out of an affordable child care scheme from September, which is a significant step, parents will have the information to determine how they can access it. </p>

            <p eId="para_381">What is the status of the legislation for the single affordable child care scheme? As the committees will be going into recess in two weeks' time, I presume the scheme will not be in place before the end of the summer. Also what engagement or work is being done by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to that legislation? As I understand it, legislative change is required in terms of the remit of the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to this scheme. Each time we try to move forward on the child care issue we are hit with the road block of legislation. This has certainly been the case during the past 12 months. Perhaps the Minister will outline the timeline in regard to the ICT system.</p>

In regard to the ICT, we are in a process.</p>
            <p eId="para_383">The development of the ICT infrastructure for the affordable child care scheme has gone into what is called a peer review process in the context of the development of complicated systems within the Oireachtas that are helpful to ensure that, ultimately, we get it right, even though it takes time. We have begun a significant part of the process. A number of steps have been gone through already. The business case is currently being reviewed. Work on the business support requirements is under way and the functional requirements specification will be finalised by the end of June. We have done some data sharing requirements with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection. Those have been finalised with the plan for the ICT system, and this links with the development in that respect. For example, the Department of Social Protection has agreed to host the affordable child care scheme, ACS, data. I could go on. There are a number of ways in which the different Departments are working very closely with us, both in terms of ICT and data protection, to ensure we get it right.</p>

            <p eId="para_387">My question is regarding the school completion programmes. I seek the Minister's views on the status of the employment audit and the school completion programme as a community response strategy, as outlined in the ESRI report.</p>

            <p eId="para_388">The ESRI review, to which the Deputy refers was, as she is aware, conducted in 2015. It recognised the important role that the school completion programme plays in working with children at risk of dropping out of school. However, the review also highlighted the need for a fit for purpose structure with effective governance and employment models in place. The report suggested that the governance and employment structures adopted by Tusla will be key in meeting the future objectives of the programme nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_389"> Following the ESRI review Tusla commissioned an employment audit, which is what the Deputy's question is about, to be carried out to examine the issues raised in the review. The employment audit pointed to important issues regarding the employment status of the school completion programme staff around the country. For example, some 55% of staff had no employment contract or inappropriate employment contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_390"> In response to the employment audit, Tusla's educational welfare service undertook a series of initial steps to address these matters. First, a specialist firm was contracted to provide human resources and industrial relations advice and support to the local management committee chairpersons and school completion programme co-ordinators. This firm is providing an ongoing 24/7 service via phone. Second, a suite of appropriate contract templates was developed by a specialist human resource firm, to be used by the local management committees for the various full and part-time positions on school completion programmes. Third, governance training for local management committees and school completion programme co-ordinators has been provided by The Wheel, which is now complete. Fourth, Foróige was contracted to conduct a staff learning needs analysis. This was followed by a continuous professional development programme in response to the training needs identified. Foróige also provided day to day management of the school completion programme nationally on behalf of Tusla's educational welfare service for a short period. This was to allow Tusla to reinforce the structure of its educational welfare service by hiring additional resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_391"> The board of Tusla has also considered a number of other options to address the governance and employment issues. An expert panel has been put in place to consider those options in detail and it will be reporting to me in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_392">I thank the Minister for her reply. I have been contacted by school completion programme co-ordinators who are concerned about the audit and about not having heard fully from the audit people as to what is envisaged. There are rumours about closures and amalgamations. They are into the holiday season now and will return at the end of August. I want to acknowledge the great work the school completion programmes do and the gaps they filled in the recession years when there was a loss of language teachers and visiting and resource teachers for Travellers and the way in which they supported after-school clubs, business in the community and team parenting programmes. I sometimes wonder when audits are carried out by outside agencies if they get a good sense of the work that is being done on the ground, particularly given that we are talking about very disadvantaged areas. Is the Minister committed to the school completion programme as a strategy to address educational disadvantage?</p>

            <p eId="para_393">I thank the Deputy for her question. I am fully committed to the school completion programme as a strategy to address ways in which we can support our young people to stay in school, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_394"> Regarding the audit which was conducted a while ago, I have described a number of steps that have been put in place working with school completion programmes on the ground during the past year and a half in order to begin to provide the support that will be required to ensure their effectiveness as we move forward. The employment and contract issues are serious. I appreciate there are rumours and concerns about what is happening. A process has been put in place to support them on the ground. I also put in place an expert panel, comprising officials from my Department and from the Department off Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills and senior staff from Tusla, which is chaired by the CEO of Tusla. It is examining various issues with respect to the way to put in place the best model for the school completion programme in order that we can move beyond the employment and governance concerns and effectively ensure that our children stay in school as long as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_395">I acknowledge the progress that has been made in the retention figures and in the progression to third level. However, both the Minister and I represent constituencies where progression to third level is way below the national average. School completion programmes play a role in that respect. When an audit is carried out or new measures are being introduced, there must be engagement with the people working on the ground and we must have their involvement at all levels. I am referring to the school completion programme co-ordinators and the people who support them in the schools. Sometimes they get lost in audits and reports as we move forward. With respect to what has emerged now and the plans for the future, I ask that the school completion programme co-ordinators are involved in that process and that they will be engaged with on every aspect of that. That is my ask, namely, that from today they will have direct input into that process as we go forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_396">My understanding is that they have been not involved only in terms of the review but perhaps, more importantly, subsequent to it in the various steps that Tusla has put in place and various training and engagement that is under way throughout the different programmes throughout the country. If the Deputy has information that this is not happening, I would be very keen to be aware of it. The Deputy can talk to me, write to me or email me about that. I completely agree with her that they should be the ones who are informing the process. My understanding is that they have had that opportunity. This group is meeting. We are trying to review what are the best elements that should be in place in terms of the best model and moving it forward. If I have any concerns whatsoever that the people on the ground have not been sufficiently informed of that, I will certainly find other ways to ensure that they are.</p>

            <p eId="para_412">I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 52 and 553 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_413"> The issue of sustainability in child care services is challenging and multifaceted. The rate of subvention funding provided by my Department’s child care schemes is at the core of this, but there are also other significant issues. These include the receipt of parental contributions; funding from Tusla and other sources for services related to child care; and the scope of care offered by providers, in particular in the community sector. The scope of care often goes beyond the core child care and early years care and education or school age child care funded by my Department. I am confident that the reduced parental co-payment that will be required as part of the September 2017 more affordable child care measures and the new affordable child care scheme will improve community providers’ sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_414"> My Department is in the process of commissioning an independent review of the cost of quality child care. This will be put to tender by mid-August and will be completed within a number of months. My officials have been scoping the work that will be involved and preparing terms of reference for the study. Issues to be examined in the independent review will include average unit costs for child care providers, both centre-based providers and home-based childminders; factors that result in different costs for different providers, including age of children, geography, such as rural versus urban, whether a service is a community service or private, and aspects of the quality of provision; comparison of unit costs in high quality services with average services; possible impact of future cost pressures, including potential wage increases; and analysis of the child care market, including the functioning of the child care market in disadvantaged areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_415"> I anticipate that the independent review will be a key input in informing future decisions on the funding of child care schemes, including both the ECCE free pre-school programme and the affordable child care scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_417">I thank the Minister for her response. The crux of my question related to the programme for Government and the independent review the Department for Children and Youth Affairs was going to carry out. It was a follow-on from where Early Childhood Ireland was last year, a more in-depth review where it was doing the sums. Early Childhood Ireland did the sums last year and the Minister's Department was going to conduct an independent review which would cover the average unit cost, age, geography, community versus private, and bring it down to wages and the sustainability of the entire sector and the funding it would take to move on with the sector rather than it being funded by the parents. We need to make sure that we have a sustainable, affordable, integrated child care sector in the future.

            <p eId="para_418">We hear much about quality in relation to the early years and child care sector, but consistency equals quality. In order to have consistency we must ensure we encourage staff to enter the sector and then remain in it. The Minister will be aware that I have been undertaking a report in recent months. People working in the sector have told me time and again that they would love to remain working in it but unfortunately they cannot because they are not paid enough and they have to sign on during summer months. Eventually they leave. Many of them go on to train as special needs assistants or in primary education, although that is not what they wanted to do originally. That is not what we want for that sector either. If personnel are constantly changing when caring for children, we will not have quality child care. That cannot be the case. Any review or analysis that has been done shows there have to be realistic wages in the sector. We should start with a living wage.</p>

            <p eId="para_419">There are a number of things which I am doing now because of the urgency of the situation and in order to support the movement towards the sustainability we have all spoken about. A piece of independent research is being commissioned - I hope it will be put out by mid-August - and it is critical. While we wait for that, given the urgency of the challenges faced by the services, I have asked the officials in my Department to address two of the most acute issues relating to sustainability that the sector has identified to me. That relates to the impact of the removal of unqualified community employment scheme participants from the core child staff ratios and funding for the administrative work done by services or non-contact time. Officials are in the process of administering payments totalling €1 million to a number of services which had relied on CE participants as core staff. A large proportion of funding has already been paid out. In addition, my Department is currently administering non-contact time payments to providers totalling €14.5 million. The average payment per service is €2,600. I was also pleased to allocate an additional €3.5 million in non-contact payment recently for services which sign up for the September 2017 more affordable child care measures. That is €18 million in 2017 for non-contact time. I look forward to responding to some of the issues the Deputies raised, especially Deputy Funchion, in more detail tomorrow.</p>

            <p eId="para_420">I also welcome the funding allocated for non-contact time but it is critical that the independent review is conducted as urgently as possible. I fear that the sector might begin to contract if we do not have the right information because when people do their sums, they will look to see where they can make a living from this business. Whether they are a private operator or even a community operator, they will see where they can find their margins. The margins are in the ECCE and in the after school care. There is very little money to be made in minding babies with the ratio of 1: 3. That ratio has to be adhered to at all times but that is not what the issue is here. Rather they need the support to know there is a sustainable sector. They need to know in which direction it is going. My fear is that it is contracting. Deputy McConalogue told me recently that one of his constituents in Donegal has no full-day child care in his area for the simple reason that only ECCE or afterschool care is being provided. I welcome the review is going out to tender in August.</p>

            <p eId="para_421">I welcome the Minister's remarks about funding for non-contact and acknowledge the work she is doing in this sector. Progress is being made. I want to reiterate that staff views must be considered in relation to this. There has been a lack of consultation with the sector. Clever things could be done in this sector, including streamlining inspections which has an impact on quality and sustainability for the sector. The Minister should bear this in mind. As she said, we will discuss this in more detail tomorrow.</p>

            <p eId="para_422">On Deputy Funchion's last point, officials in my Department have been very committed to finding ways to consult with, and hear from, the sector. That is not to say we have heard from everyone but most recently they have been on a roadshow giving information to providers about the more affordable child care which will start in September 2017. My understanding is there has been strong and robust conversations at those gatherings, which have been sold out in various parts of the country, where the officials and providers have met face-to-face. Much of that discussion is not merely about explaining what we are putting in place in September but also the issues which the Deputies raised on pay and working conditions. It is a huge challenge because the Department is not the employer of the people who provide the services. I hope I will be successful in securing more money to raise the ECCE capitation rates, but how do we know for sure they will be passed on to the employees? These are huge issues. </p>
            <p eId="para_423"> I refer to non-contact time. We hope for that and I am asking providers to look at this. It makes it more complicated that we are not the employers but that is not to say we will not try to lead in ways to ensure these things are made better.</p>

            <p eId="para_424">31. <b>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan</b> asked the <b>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</b> if she has considered concerns raised by persons working and managing child care centres and with members at questions with regard to the changes to community employment suitability in the sector and the effects this is having on community child care, in particular in marginalised communities; and the way in which she will address these concerns.

            <p eId="para_426">Community child care providers are receiving €1 million to ensure continuation of services during this period of change. Those payments have started and providers are receiving them to ensure there is no disruption for providers, parents and, perhaps most important of all, children. The money is being targeted at those services that experienced some difficulties in meeting regulatory requirements as a result of recent changes, most notably services that rely on people on community employment schemes to form part of their core staff. The money was given as recognition of the challenges faced during a period of transition, and it is also important to remember why these changes are taking place. If we are to change child care radically in this country, we must not only tackle the affordability issue but also ensure quality. Additionally, we must ensure our children are being cared for in a safe environment with qualified staff. As I stated before, when it comes to our children, there will be no compromise on safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> Under recent legislation, each employee working directly with children attending a preschool service must now hold at least a major award in early childhood care and education at level 5 or an equivalent qualification. It should be noted the vast majority of services were able to implement the new requirements through their existing structures and supports. The €1 million fund was, however, made available to those which could not. My officials are vigilant to challenges facing the community child care sector and to offer support when required. Further funding will be decided within the context of budget 2018. In the longer term, the independent review of the cost of quality child care, which will be commissioned I hope by mid August, will also include consideration of factors that affect the financial viability of the child care sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_428">There is absolutely no question about the need for quality training for people who are working in child care. Some community child care facilities were reliant on members from community employment, CE, schemes. It had a double-edged benefit as some of the people on the CE schemes were parents getting training in child care for themselves as well as in the setting where they worked. It provided a service in the community as well, which was important. We know the figures in the more disadvantaged areas and the kind of backgrounds that children come from.</p>
            <p eId="para_429"> I note the Minister's comments about extra funding but it is about seeing that it gets to the areas of most need. Some of the staff from community child care services have been in touch with me and others here. As they do not have the staff at the level of training that we would all like to see and they relied on CE participants, they face being told they need a plan for sustainability. The only sustainable plan is to cut hours and nobody, including the Minister, wants to see that. We discussed the possibility of a DEIS status for some of these child care centres and the Minister stated it was being examined in her Department. Has there been any further move on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_430">I have raised this before as well and there are wider issues in the longer run with respect to sustainability. The Minister has again emphasised the €1 million in sustainability funding but it is 185 days since it was announced, and as far as I am aware, no service in Cork has received the second tranche of funding. The first tranche for advertisement and recruitment was received but no service in Cork has received the second tranche. It is 185 days on. The services were asked to submit considerable amounts of documentation, which they did, but the Department came back with a new form that it had not previously asked for called template B or something like it. It is a poor way for the Department to treat community services, which feel like they are being strung along. We are still risking services going under or being curtailed significantly due to a failure to provide money in the here and now.</p>

            <p eId="para_431">I thank the Deputies. Deputy O'Sullivan commented on a DEIS-style approach, particularly for disadvantaged communities. On a personal level I think it is a wonderful vision and I have been raising that within the Department. I agree with the Deputy and it would be a substantial policy change if we moved towards that. There is merit in considering it. With an acknowledgement of the issues the Deputy identifies with regard to CE workers and particularly people living in the community who are receiving a wage, there are ways in which the Department has tried to give support both in moving forward with the regulations and providing more money up to a certain point, working with services in order to take a look at the model and ensure they will be in a better place in 2018. For the medium term, I am aware that in disadvantaged communities, there are often other types of support going into the care and early years in education setting that go beyond what is strictly funded by my Department. We are trying to see whether the Health Service Executive or other statutory agencies could also provide support for additional care in those communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_432">I will raise a particular community child care project with the Minister, although I do not expect her to be able to answer my questions on it. It is a community after-school project that has existed since 1995. It is an accredited training centre and caters for five local schools. There are over 100 attendees for 48 weeks in the year. They offer a variety of practices, including restorative practices etc. The Department of Social Protection wants to remove a supervisor's position from November this year, meaning there will be reduced management available. The effect will be on the service, with the reduction coming to three days in one project and two days in another project. It is an area of real disadvantage and there does not appear to be any leeway. I know this is not in the Minister's Department but it is connected to her Department. I will send the details to the Minister and she might be able to engage with the Department of Social Protection on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_433">Of course I will and I would be happy to pursue that. That would be a good way to proceed. Deputy Ó Laoghaire raised questions relating to the sustainability fund. With regard to the first tranche of money from the sustainability fund, 47 providers have signed and returned contracts in respect of the phase, with each being paid approximately €2,000. The city and county child care committees are working with a further 67 services across the country to make submissions for once-off payment under the second phase, as the Deputy noted in respect to Cork services, with an average payment that will probably be approximately €15,000. It is really important to identify that. To date, four services have submitted complete applications for phase two, with a further 17 expected to reach the stage shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> The Deputy indicates some of the services in Cork are finding the requirements for additional documentation a bit onerous. I will take that back to the Department. My understanding is that with payment from the fund we are trying to enable services to move to a place where they can be sustainable after the money is spent. Perhaps that is related to some of the requirements for documentation. I will certainly look into it.</p>

            <p eId="para_438">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 554 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_439"> The well-being of all staff, including social care workers, is of great concern to me and to their employing organisations. I also would like to note that Tusla had a national social work turnover rate of 8.4% in the first few months of the year, with some areas exceeding this. The national figure, however, compares favourably with other jurisdictions, such as England, where the 2016 turnover rate was approximately 15%. Tusla has a health and well-being and employee assistance programme department as part of its human resources since January 2017. Tusla also has a critical incident stress management programme in place. Training and supports are provided on an ongoing basis to all staff. It appears that Tusla’s efforts are paying dividends. The latest absenteeism rate for April 2017 was 6.38% for social care workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_440">That shows a positive trend when compared to April 2016 when the absenteeism rate was 7.71%. Similarly, absenteeism at Oberstown Children Detention Campus has followed a downward trend in response to management’s support of staff. It includes the availability of the employee assistance programme, an organisational psychologist and the introduction of a volunteer peer support workers programme accredited by the Carlow Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_441"> As the Deputy is aware, Tusla has been allocated Exchequer funding of €713 million in 2017. That represents an increase of €37 million on its funding in 2016 and will allow Tusla to proceed with an ambitious ongoing programme of service reform and transformation. The programme is under way, with a particular focus on governance, risk management, health and safety, quality assurance and service monitoring to support the delivery of the best front-line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_442"> Tusla continues to evaluate management and the staff skills mix with a view to enhancing services. It includes reviewing the roles of family support workers, social care workers in the community and administrative structures to support the delivery of a more efficient and cost-effective set of services. These are the measures I believe address the concerns raised in the Deputy's question.</p>

            <p eId="para_443">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer and welcome everything she said. One of the reasons I tabled my question was to get the answer the Minister has given, namely, that supports are available for social care workers and all those involved with Tusla. The other reason relates to the children who lose a social care worker or when a social care worker, having accessed the supports, no longer wants to continue working because the demand is so great. I asked one of two representatives who appeared before the committee recently the number of social care cases they would expect to have. They could not answer us; they could not say whether they should have 35, 55 or 65 cases for the simple reason that every case is significant and must be examined on a case by case basis. The Minister has said a 15% turnaround rate in this respect is comparable with that in other countries, but when we take workers out of the system, we let down children. We are taking away key supports, about which I have a serious concern in terms of meeting future needs, and it is coming across in HIQA reports. Good staff are walking away from the job because we do not offer key supports to retain them such as a good ICT communications system. Retention is crucial in an industry in which only 230 qualify annually.</p>

            <p eId="para_444">I appreciate the Deputy's comments. What I have been doing is identifying the measures Tusla is putting in place to address concerns. Social workers, social care workers and even administrative staff working with Tusla are working at the coalface. These are hugely difficult and challenging jobs. As the Deputy identified, in terms of staff, it is important to pay attention to concerns about attrition rates, exhaustion, etc. I am identifying some of the measures Tusla is putting in place in order to do this, including evaluations that look at enhanced job roles and increasing multidisciplinary team working in an effort to alleviate pressure as part of an ongoing reform programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_445"> I particularly welcome Tusla's focus in 2017 on leadership development and supporting the forthcoming workforce development plan through learning and development and succession planning, for which I have asked. I talk about the issue of workforce development planning when I meet its representatives every quarter. I will have another such meeting with the executive relatively soon. That is a critical aspect of Tusla's planning for some of the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_446">Tusla needs to think outside the box in this regard. While we acknowledge that it is under pressure in recruiting staff into the organisation, we should consider the opportunities available in terms of co-operating with advocacy groups. I am talking about EPIC and the role of YAP Ireland. We should engage more with these advocacy groups because they have a skill set to support Tusla. We should also consider the likes of Sugru, a not for profit organisation that has been set up. There are various groups to which Tusla can reach out to work with that can help with lower priority cases, which would leave the expert skilled staff free to deal with priority cases. That will allow us to get to the core issues as quickly as possible and, importantly, retain the good people we have attracted into Tusla. Retention is critical if we are to develop Tusla and it is to continue to be the child protection agency we want into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_447">The Deputy has made very good suggestions and I am aware that Tusla is doing some of it. As she identified, it could be doing more, particularly in the various regional settings, in which, of course, I believe. I will certainly raise the matter with those involved in Tusla when I meet them. Proceeding in that way takes planning, time, etc. However, some of the Deputy's suggestions might result in finding ways to save time and ensure people involved in organisations within the civil society sector are able to complement the work done by a statutory agency. That would be welcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_450">For foster care to work, we must at all times have panels of carers. This reason alone means that recruitment is constant and ongoing. I appeal to anyone with an interest in caring for children to visit the Tusla website, <i>www.tusla.ie</i>. The foster care section is well laid out. It provides answers for many questions, including the nature of foster care, the diverse group of people who can become carers, how to apply, as well as videos of children, parents and a social worker. I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House will join me in paying tribute to those who do come forward. The reason recruitment is constant is we need as diverse a group of carers as possible because children themselves are a diverse group. We also need both long-term and short-term carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_451"> The criteria for assessing suitability to become a carer are based on a person's willingness and ability to care appropriately for a vulnerable child. An assessment is carried out, irrespective of nationality, race, religion, sexual identity, marital status, disability status or whether someone is already a parent. Latest figures show there are 4,816 foster carers providing care for 5,834 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_452"> Most Tusla teams have sufficient numbers, but achieving the diversity I outlined can be challenging. It is for that reason that recruitment is constant.</p>
            <p eId="para_453"> I am also happy that the outcomes for children in foster care here are much praised by professional colleagues abroad, especially in terms of school completion, stability, family centred care and progress in third level education.</p>

            <p eId="para_454">We have had some appalling abuse scandals within the foster care system, but I, too, acknowledge the hundreds of kind and caring people who present as foster parents for children who present with many challenges and difficulties in their lives. On the figures given by the Minister, it is good to know that generally the numbers are sufficient. However, I raise the question because of concerns I have heard about finding foster parents in some situations. The social workers involved were confident they would be able to find foster parents, but they were having difficulties in some instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_455"> I ask about the provision of adequate support and even training for people who are coming forward as foster parents. There could be a concern that we have a system of guardians in court for children, but what happens after that? That is where foster parents have additional difficulties and challenges with some of the children they are fostering. To follow on from the previous question about social workers, is there enough support and training available for them?</p>

            <p eId="para_456">I appreciate the Deputy's comments. I am aware that concerns have been raised, even in some of HIQA's reports which identified that things were not as good as they could be. Regarding foster care committees in particular, HIQA identified some concerns and ways in which improvements could be made. My Department is working with Tusla to ensure it is developing an alternative care strategy to guide improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_457">My Department is fully involved with Tusla on oversight with regard to required improvements and the Irish Association of Social Workers has produced a report outlining necessary improvements in foster care services. My officials have engaged with the Irish Association of Social Workers to hear its views and we are also in regular contact with the Irish Foster Care Association in order to ensure we can move forward in terms of those improvements.</p>

            <p eId="para_459">The concern is that we have over-worked social workers and under-supported foster parents, and we must ensure we do not have an overbalance of one or the other. If somebody presents to be a foster parent, it is necessary that there is training for them, particularly for those who are not parents and have not had that experience, although there are parents who could also do with extra training. In addition to training, however, they also need support. We know that, in some cases, they are being presented with very challenging young children, particularly teenagers, and looking for foster parents for teenagers can be particularly difficult. Foster parents need extra support and this is connected to the point on whether social workers also have the support they need to carry out that work. There are so many cases coming to social workers, whose work is already very difficult. It is a question of ensuring the supports are there.</p>

            <p eId="para_460">I can assure the Deputy that Tusla has put in place a number of supports in terms of training, as well as providing link workers to work with many of the families. In answering some of the other questions, I have tried to identify ways in which members of Tusla are supported themselves in the work they do. While I am not saying there is no room for more of that, and I have identified the ways in which my Department is working with Tusla to find room for improvement, there are supports in place for foster carers.</p>

Obviously, they have come to this situation through some trauma in their own lives.

            <p eId="para_463">To follow on from the last exchange, foster carers are acknowledged as the backbone of our child care services. Foster care is, by far, the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection. It is the preferred option in Ireland for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians. At the end of March this year, 92% of children in care were in a foster care placement. More than a quarter of these children are placed with relative foster carers and the rest are with general foster carers. Foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system.</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> It is vital that all children in care and their carers receive adequate support to ensure a successful placement. Key elements of the support provided to foster carers include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a child and family social worker for each child in care. It is important that foster carers have access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs. In some situations, respite care for children may be arranged, if and when it is part of their care plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_465"> Pre-assessment and ongoing training is compulsory for all foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high-quality care. Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately in recognition of the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care. In addition to these supports, foster carers are entitled to specific support in the event of an allegation of abuse or neglect, or a serious concern being made relating to the quality of care provided or experienced. For foster carers, this may include being supported by the support and mediation service provided by the Irish Foster Care Association. Tusla has initiated a new national policy to guide social workers in how they should deal with allegations about foster carers.</p>

            <p eId="para_466">I could not agree more with the Minister when she says children in foster care and their supportive foster care families deserve and should receive all necessary supports. I have already mentioned that no matter what leads to a child being in foster care, there has been some type of chaos within their family situation. There is no doubt many of these children need psychological services and extra medical services to help them reach their full potential. This is not always the case, however, and I have to share with the Minister the heart-breaking case that only recently occurred in my constituency of Kildare South.</p>
            <p eId="para_467"> A nine-year old boy from Dublin, who we will call John, was placed with a family as their very first foster child. This was possibly the first mistake because John had many needs and perhaps it should have been a more experienced family at that point in time. John had lived a very chaotic life. Both his parents were drug addicts and his father was in prison. He arrived into a loving home and a huge bond was formed, despite the many issues he had, such as the fact he was never taught to use a toilet and that he pulled a knife on his foster parents. In spite of all of this, he did not miss a day in school and the family were in constant contact with a very supportive school. He joined a local football club and he loved it. However, the foster family begged for additional psychological supports and they did not receive them. When I put this down as a parliamentary question, John was still in his home and his foster parents were begging for these supports. Since then, he has been removed and put in a residential home. He has to start in a new school. He has no football club. This is a disgrace.</p>

            <p eId="para_469">I would be happy to receive additional information and to follow up on that case outside the context of the Chamber. It is important to note that most foster carers have a link social worker who provides a support to them. It is the case that Tusla has identified that the priority in terms of link social workers is for new placements, children nearing 18 or children with challenges such as disability, mental health and situations where there are difficulties regarding access. That additional support is important in those types of cases. In addition, Tusla is providing funding to the Irish Foster Care Association, which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a phone advice service.</p>

            <p eId="para_470">I thank the Minister and do not for a moment doubt her bona fides in this area. I will be in contact with her office in regard to this specific situation. I have listened to the tears of the heart-broken foster mother, who really felt she was the last chance for this young boy. I would share the foster mother's concerns about this little boy surviving and having a life that a young boy of his age should have.</p>
            <p eId="para_471"> I know Tusla and the social workers operate in an environment of uncertainty and I accept that, in many cases, the social workers are not getting the supports they need. As the Minister acknowledges, it is hugely important that the interventions take place. The supports that are needed have to be readily accessible. I believe John's foster situation was doomed to fail before it began because of the lack of assessment of his needs and the failure to put supports in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_472">These foster families absolutely need to have all they can to sort out the chaos of these children's lives. As my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, said, it is so important to link in with EPIC, Sugru and Care Leavers' Network with regard to their life experiences.</p>

If at times, and perhaps this is the case in this instance, this does not provide sufficient support it is regrettable. I look forward to continuing the conversation.</p>

            <p eId="para_476">Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic violence. This year, Tusla will allocate €22.1 million for the provision of services tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. This represents an increase of €1.5 million over 2016. It will assist in increasing capacity and improving access to emergency accommodation and other support services for women and children fleeing domestic violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_477"> Tusla facilitates a range of services to victims of domestic violence and their families, including 155 family units, comprising 147 emergency refuge family units and eight emergency non-refuge family units. The remit of these services is to provide safe emergency accommodation on a short-term basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_478"> I highly value the work of service providers who work with victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. It is important to break the cycle of violence, as children who grow up in an atmosphere of violence can be affected for many years to come. Refuges provide a place of safety for families in this situation, but a refuge is not a home. We know that the well-being of children is best supported by enabling children to live safely in their own homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_479"> My Government colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, has responsibility for Rebuilding Ireland, which contains a commitment to provide additional emergency refuge accommodation spaces for victims of domestic violence. This is in addition to those emergency refuge spaces already supported by Tusla. I worked very closely with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, when he held this brief, and I look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on it now.</p>
            <p eId="para_480"> While there is no verified data, anecdotal evidence from service providers indicates the current homelessness crisis is impacting on the length of stay of families in refuges. Tusla is very concerned about this situation. My officials are in regular contact with Tusla, and we share the same motivation, which is to do everything we can to alleviate the concerns of families in refuges, and those families who are seeking refuge spaces.</p>

            <p eId="para_481">The Minister has attended a number of Women's Aid events so I know she has an interest in the area. What prompted me to ask the question is in my constituency we have a women's refuge that covers counties Carlow and Kilkenny, but because it is being used as emergency accommodation, last year it had to refuse 321 referrals. The housing crisis means women fleeing domestic violence are not able to access accommodation. They might be able to access secondary services but accommodation is crucial. Unfortunately, many of the women will end up going back into the situation, which will have a detrimental effect on them and their children. Will the Minister ask Tusla to do an audit to ensure where there are domestic violence refuges they are being used for that, and that alone, and that they are allowed to get on with that very important work and are not being used as an overflow for the housing crisis? It is a crisis, but it is a different situation and should not impact on domestic violence services for women and children.</p>

            <p eId="para_482">I am aware of the issue the Deputy is raising. She knows that the challenges involved in providing longer-term housing for those who find themselves homeless can impact, as I have said, on the length of time a family stays in emergency refuge accommodation. Of course this can have a knock-on effect on spaces for those with acute safety needs seeking access to a refuge. I am concerned that the level of demand for services in the Deputy's region is greater than the current available capacity, and I appreciate her raising the matter. Tusla will allocate funding of €493,000 to the refuge this year, and it is committed to ensuring there is more equitable access to the services, but it will also work in partnership with local organisations, such as Amber Kilkenny Women's Refuge, to obtain the best possible supports for families experiencing domestic violence in Ireland. As part of its approach it is assessing the level of need throughout the country and is working closely with key stakeholders to develop an appropriate service response.</p>

            <p eId="para_483">I welcome that. It is important that we have an audit of the services to ensure they are being used for their purpose. I invite the Minister to visit Amber in Kilkenny. It would definitely appreciate it. As it covers both counties there are huge difficulties for women leaving a domestic violence situation in County Carlow because, realistically, if they want to leave the situation they must uproot with their children and move 30 minutes away. Many women will not do this. It is not realistic to move children going to school to a different county. I invite the Minister to come down and see the service and see the work it is doing on domestic violence. It is important a nationwide audit is carried out. One refuge for two counties is not adequate and I am sure it is happening in other parts of the country. It is important that we carry out an audit so domestic violence services can deal solely with domestic violence and not have to take up the burden of emergency accommodation for housing.</p>

I confirm that five additional family accommodation units will be available in the Dublin area in early 2018. This is with regard to providing more refuge places for women and children fleeing violence in their homes. We also plan to have an additional five units in Galway, which should be ready by September next year, and additional accommodation comprising five units will come onstream in Clare by the end of next year.

            <p eId="para_488"> The Deputy specifically mentioned children living in the direct provision system, for which the Minister for Justice and Equality has responsibility. Children living in direct provision remain in the care of their parents. If any concern is raised regarding the safety, well-being and welfare of a child living in direct provision it is reported to Tusla and the case is treated as any other referral would be. Tusla has located an experienced team leader child protection social worker to the Reception and Integration Agency to better support access to Tusla services for vulnerable families in direct provision and to provide advice and guidance to staff working in direct provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_489"> Under the Dáil resolution of 10 November 2016, we have committed to bringing separated children seeking asylum to Ireland.

            <p eId="para_490">Up to the end of June, we received 22 young people under this programme, all boys between the ages of 13 and 17 years. They come from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria and South Sudan.</p>

My Department has joint responsibility with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to identify and provide supports for separated children seeking asylum who are part of this relocation programme. So far, six children and young people from Iraq and Syria have been received into care. A child may also present at an Irish port of entry seeking asylum. In this instance, he or she will be referred to Tusla for assessment and appropriate care.</p>

            <p eId="para_493">I was not particularly looking at services of social workers and non-national children living in direct provision centres but also those children living in appalling private rented accommodation. I know we have responsible landlords but, unfortunately, I have seen some appalling private rented accommodation in which there is serious overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. I was thinking of children living in these settings who do not have access to the activities and services of which other children can avail. I am thinking of sports, arts, music and drama. Just this morning, I was in a family resource centre in Dublin 1. It is working with families who come from direct provision centres. There is play therapy and a summer project available for the children. It also connects the dots with various other services that the children need. My question was about access to the other activities and services our children have which are difficult to access for those in direct provision centres.</p>

            <p eId="para_494">That is a good example. My understanding is there are efforts aimed at outreach and engagement in other settings. That is what we want and hope to do. As well as the education and welfare supports children in direct provision centres require, Tusla has a commitment to the principle that every child residing in Ireland should have equal access to services, regardless of nationality or status. Places such as family resource centres provide resources to do this. The Deputy’s story will help me to go back and ensure it is happening in other places also.</p>

            <p eId="para_495">The resource centre in question organised an event last Friday entitled "We Belong". It looked at people who were living in the area with foreign nationals and providing the same range of services and activities for all of them. There are parts of the Dublin Central constituency where the non-national population is more than 51%. As the Minister addressed a conference in the Gresham recently, she knows the ongoing work being done on the issue of integration. For organisations such as the family resource centres, a little extra funding, particularly at holiday time, would help in including children from direct provision centres or other non-national children and allow them to have access to those outings and activities in which Irish children take part. That was the point my question sought to address.</p>

            <p eId="para_498">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, for taking my Topical Issue matter. Fianna Fáil has been contacted by Children’s Liver Disease Ireland, a voluntary organisation, the aim of which is to support families who have a child with liver disease. It is a small group as liver disease in children is uncommon. Nonetheless, for those affected, it is a serious issue for them and their families. Children have to travel to the United Kingdom for treatment for serious liver disease, with liver transplantation and Kasai procedures the main treatments. All families know the worries that go with the transplantation process, but they have been compounded by other factors recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> In early January staff shortages in the Air Corps resulted in serious pressure being exerted on the ability of combined services that compromised emergency medical transport services. The impact of this pressure means that, despite a professional and dedicated team, the air ambulance service cannot guarantee that a child will be transported to the United Kingdom in the six-hour window period allowed for the donor of a liver. Parents of children affected had this explained to them and, understandably, some of them have taken the decision to move to London while their children await a transplant. Children’s Liver Disease Ireland believes the Health Service Executive, HSE, has made decisions about the air ambulance service which will impact on children's plans. It does not believe a reliable service will be available to children awaiting a transplant for many months. One mother who lived through having a child on a transplant list told us how she knew how those who did faced many dilemmas and risk factors. It is not unreasonable that the system should represent their decision about a risky transport system as their opinions are respected in medical decisions about their children. </p>
            <p eId="para_500"> Obviously, the cost of living in a different city, as well as absence from work and home, are significant. A child can be on a transplant list for many months, even up to a year, but may not require hospitalisation. I understand the Department of Health has instructed the HSE to provide these families with financial support on a case-by-case basis. However, I understand the families that have moved to London have been informed they do not meet the criteria for the provision of this financial support. I also understand that initially all liver transplant children were told they did not meet the criteria. Following queries to Our Lady’s Children Hospital, Crumlin, some but not all liver transplant children were granted financial support. There was no explanation given of the criteria used. The families need clarity at this stressful time. Will the Minister of State respond to the questions I have raised?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Finian McGrath)<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_501">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. I know that she has a good record on health and disability issues. It gives me the opportunity to inform the House about air ambulance services and the supports available to families of children receiving medical treatment abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_502"> The United Kingdom and Ireland share a common organ pool base. When donor organs become available, they are submitted to the common pool for transplant to the most appropriate patient on the waiting list. The United Kingdom provides paediatric transplant services on behalf of Ireland and they are organised through the treatment abroad scheme. In 2016 nine paediatric liver transplant and eight cardiac patients were treated under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_503"> Responsibility for the co-ordination of transport logistics for paediatric transplant transfers rests with the National Ambulance Service, NAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">The NAS uses three providers for these transfers: the Irish Air Corps, the Irish Coast Guard and private air ambulance companies. The NAS prepares an individualised transport logistics plan for each patient and keeps the plan updated. This logistics plan takes into account the patient's location, medical requirements and the time window available in which to complete the transport. The timeframe to transfer a liver patient is six hours, whereas a shorter timeframe of four hours is available for cardiac transplant patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_505"> As the Deputy will be aware, the Air Corps is currently experiencing manpower challenges and has been unable to sustain the level of service previously provided for the transfer of priority paediatric transplant patients. While there is significant work under way in the Department of Defence to increase the capacity of the Air Corps, this reduction in the availability of the Air Corps resource is problematic. I accept the Deputy's point in this regard. I can assure the Deputy that the NAS has taken every step possible to ensure that contingency arrangements are in place in light of the reduced Air Corps availability. In that regard, the NAS is working closely with the Irish Coast Guard and private providers in an effort to mitigate the risks associated with the transport of patients. However, the NAS medical director is of the view that, given the current difficulties, all cardiac transplant patients should relocate to the UK in order to guarantee access to transplant surgery. He has also recommended that decisions regarding the relocation of liver transplant patients be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the location of the child. I understand the decision to relocate is a very difficult one for any family, not least the family of a sick child. Given the exceptional circumstances with regard to air ambulance transfers, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has asked the HSE, through the treatment abroad scheme, to make a financial contribution to families who are advised to and who choose to relocate.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> In the meantime, I understand that every effort is being made to address the shortages in personnel faced by the Air Corps, and a plan is in place to allow it to return to full strength. The Deputy may wish to note that following a recent notification from the Irish Coast Guard of reduced availability for inter-hospital transfer services due to scheduled fleet maintenance, the Air Corps rosters were changed at very short notice to provide additional cover, in case an organ became available for a transplant patient. This arrangement, at very short notice, illustrates the strong interdepartmental co-operation evident in the provision of the air ambulance services.</p>

            <p eId="para_507">I thank the Minister of State for his positive response, which was very welcome. From what I hear, funds will be made available to families through the treatment abroad fund. The cardiac cases are approved but the liver patient decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the location of the patient. Will there be two different approaches for those in the west and in Louth?</p>
            <p eId="para_508"> Both liver and heart conditions are very serious. Regardless of whether a heart or liver is to be transplanted, the child has to get from Ireland to England. Regrettably, air transport is currently provided only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and there is no weekend service. The Minister of State reassured me there is a private air ambulance company employed. I am sure he can guarantee me it is available 24-7, when requested. When Crumlin hospital states a liver or heart is available in the United Kingdom for a child, are we in a position to provide the transport and meet all the standards of delivery, even if the child is living at home? Many of the liver patients are in the home setting and do not need to be in hospital at all. One can totally understand the concerns of the families. They are very concerned over the fact the air ambulance service is not the service that existed last June or July and they are concerned given what came to light last January. The families need to know they have support, including financial support. It is a huge commitment to uproot a parent and child and leave half a family behind. Some people must walk away from their job to do what is necessary until such time as we have a full air ambulance service again.</p>

            <p eId="para_509">Of course I understand the dilemma of the families, in particular those dealing with liver disease. They are very worried. I accept the Deputy's point that they need clarity. On the funds, the assessment and the point the Deputy made about Galway and Louth, I will raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Harris, because we need total clarity on this issue to reassure the families.</p>
            <p eId="para_510"> May I make four other points that are important for families to know? First, where a family is experiencing undue hardship, it may, of course, apply to the Department of Social Protection for an exceptional needs payment. It is understood that, in general, exceptional needs payments are approved when the applicant is already in receipt of some sort of income support. Second, owing to the air ambulance difficulties, we have asked the HSE to provide financial assistance to the families required to relocate. It is a difficult situation. Where a child is in hospital and the hospital cannot provide accommodation for a parent, or where the child is not hospitalised, the family will be offered a subsistence payment of €169.22 per night per family.</p>
            <p eId="para_511"> Third, while the financial contribution is generally directed at the families of cardiac patients, the HSE has also been directed to consider the requests for financial assistance for the liver transplant patients, and this is very important. Fourth, the Irish Coast Guard provides capacity for the inter-hospital transfers on an as-available basis from Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo. This is where the private providers come it. They are used regularly to supplement both emergency transfer patients, who are a priority, and scheduled transfer patients. The HSE acute hospital division has identified a comprehensive list of private air ambulance providers. This is updated continuously. The Deputy can reassure the families that lists of reliable people have been drawn up and that the service is being given. </p>
            <p eId="para_512"> I will bring the other concerns raised by Deputy Rabbitte back to the Minister, Deputy Harris, to obtain further clarity.</p>

            <p eId="para_514">I wish to bring the disgraceful lack of respite places in County Louth to the Minister of State's attention today. Last year, the acute lack of proper respite facilities in Louth reached a crisis point. Families in my area are suffering from ongoing unacceptable distress as the crisis continues to escalate. I am aware that the Minister of State has been contacted by many of the families and care groups. Let me outline some of the severe hardship cases that my office and other Deputies in Louth are dealing with. Most importantly, I ask the Minister of State to provide the funding for a facility that has been identified to provide care for 30 people. It would cost €800,000 to provide care for 30 people per annum. The service provider Praxis Care is ready to provide the service, and a premises has been identified. It just needs confirmation from the HSE that the funding will be provided. The facility could be operational within three to four months. The service would provide respite to young adults in Louth, Meath, the north midlands and north Dublin. The premises identified is just off the M1 in Drogheda.</p>
            <p eId="para_515"> I want to give some examples of the extreme hardship the families are going through without access to respite care for their loved ones. A family with a severely disabled 26-year-old daughter has been looking for respite care for three years now. Her mother rang up giving four months' notice to get four nights' respite for a trip planned for her wedding anniversary. The family was told immediately there was none available even though ample notice had been given. She was not able to get respite in May to enable her to attend her granddaughter's Holy Communion. Recently, the family was granted two nights, which was not enough time in which to plan anything meaningful. Two nights is not enough of a break for the family. The mother said she was too exhausted to do anything with the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_516">She is distraught. There is another mother who has an 18-year-old son and she is very conscious that as yet there are no specific plans in place for how adult respite will be delivered to her son. She is aware of many other families in the same predicament. Her son continues to display high-risk and challenging behaviour. Respite is a complete lifeline to them and they are extremely worried and worn out.</p>

            <p eId="para_519">I thank Deputy Breathnach for agreeing to allow me to speak on this. I appreciate his commitment, which we share, as does Deputy Adams. We have met regularly with the HSE and with Drumcar and St. John of God to try to get a solution to the problem that continues. It will continue until adequate and proper funding is provided. I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State and the Taoiseach to deal with this issue, but the scale of it is huge. There has been no increased investment by the HSE into respite care since 2008. The estimated number of new places required nationally by 2020 is 2,133. In our own HSE area, that number is 316. There is no sign of any of these places at this moment in time. There is huge distress, upset and concern. There are people crying on the phone, elderly people breaking down at meetings and parents in their 80s distraught and terribly upset. People are listening and Ministers are listening, but we need the action and we need it now.</p>

            <p eId="para_520">I thank Deputies Breathnach and O'Dowd for raising this very important issue because it gives me the opportunity to outline the position on the need for respite care for children, young adults, and ageing adults in the community in Louth. I want to make it very clear that this Government’s ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service. We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities that will empower them to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_521"> The provision of respite services has come under additional pressure in the past number of years. I accept that point. An increasing number of children and adults are now seeking access to respite, and the changing needs of people with a disability are also having an impact as they, along with the rest of the population, are living longer lives. The HSE acknowledges, as do I, the need for additional respite for adults and children with intellectual disabilities and the difficulty experienced by families with regard to the lack of respite places available. The HSE is working with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> To support these alternative ways of providing respite, funding has been provided to the HSE to provide 185 new emergency residential places and new home support and in-home respite for 210 additional people who require emergency supports has been allocated. The HSE’s social care operational plan for 2017 aims to provide 182,000 overnight stays in centre-based respite services, in addition to 41,000 day respite sessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> HSE Louth disability services have recently received a draft costing proposal submitted by a local service provider. The nature of the proposal is for the provision of a residential respite service for young adults with complex needs and challenging behaviour. No discussion has been had with the service provider regarding the costings as received for the proposed provision of a respite house that the service provider is considering developing in the Louth area. The HSE has confirmed in local discussions with the service provider that it is not in a position to give assurances to any provider regarding the independent commissioning of such a service outside procurement. The service provider was advised that if the organisation were to proceed to develop same, it would be the organisation's decision to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> I emphasise that further discussion is ongoing at CHO 8 level regarding the emerging need for additional respite services and the options to be developed to meet these needs. The HSE has advised that additional funding would be required for the development of respite services in Louth, but there is a problem with regard to that. As Minister of State, I intend to seek additional funding for residential and respite services as part of the 2018 Estimates process.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> Only yesterday, I had a meeting with the Taoiseach on the social service plan for 2018. This item was at the top of our agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_526">I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response as deeds and actions are needed, not words. I could go on for the next hour about cases that have come to the attention of my office. The Minister of State has been written to about many of those cases. For example, two social workers left Drumcar last December and since then no social worker had been there at all until last week. Just one social worker was appointed to facilitate the needs of these families. If the Minister of State cannot give a commitment to give the money needed to solve the problem in Louth immediately, I want to make a suggestion to him and I ask him to consider it. In the short term, could he not allow retired accredited intellectual disability nurses provide respite for these families in their homes? While it is not an ideal solution, that would alleviate the distress and worry of these families. Most importantly, I call on the Minister of State to get the funding to which I have referred to provide the facility that has been identified. Let us get action on this. Words are no good.</p>

            <p eId="para_527">I absolutely agree with everything Deputy Breathnach has said. It is universally true in every home in Louth where there are people with disabilities. There is an absolute lack of clarity, support and services. Yet, at the same time, more than €30 million is spent on the services of St. John of God. It is reducing its services but is not giving the funding back to the HSE or to other groups that want to provide the services. It is not doing its job.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> I appreciate the Minister of State's commitment to increased funding for Louth. What the Minister of State needs to do is attend the meeting with us, the HSE and Drumcar to sort it out once and for all. These families deserve better. No later than this afternoon, I got a call from a constituent who has a 21-year-old disabled son who never got respite. Despite applying for it, they got no answer this year - no answer at all. It is a disgrace and is unacceptable. I appreciate the Minister of State's hands-on involvement in all the issues we bring to his attention. I ask him to please deal with this issue. We will talk to him after this debate to get action and commitments.</p>

            <p eId="para_529">I accept the points raised by Deputies Breathnach and O'Dowd about needing action and deeds. Even in the last couple of days, I have written to the CEO of and people directly involved in St. John of God about the management of money. That is a separate debate but, at the same time, I am not happy with the way some of the money is being spent on services. It is unacceptable to hear that a family has told Deputy O'Dowd it received no respite.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> The management of money in services is very important. I take Deputy Breathnach's point about the retired nurses. That is a good idea. There are 101,000 families claiming the carer's grant, which is worth €1,700 and was restored recently to those families. They could use some of that money to pay for respite while we get the long-term issue resolved. However, I accept the point that we need action on respite services. We need good management of the resources. We do not need all the money going to senior managers in St. John of God's services, because the people on the front line deserve the respite services. That is the direction I want to go in.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> I also appreciate sensible ideas. We could use some of the nursing support hours. In this year's budget, I got an extra €16.2 million to support 395 people through funding for the new home support, which is in-home respite for emergency cases. Perhaps some of that money could be used for those ideas. I saw a group of nurses in north Dublin recently who have retired from St. Joseph's intellectual disability service in Portrane and are doing an excellent job of helping out the services that are in crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> I will talk to Deputies O'Dowd and Breathnach about meeting those directly involved, in particular parents who have not received the services. I would like to hear from them first hand.</p>

The raids are part of an ongoing investigation regarding suspicions of the existence of price signalling or price fixing within the insurance sector in this State. This suspicion is most evident in motor insurance prices, which most of us have had to put up with over the past number of years. However, it is far from being limited to car insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> I am sure the Minister of State is very well aware that Donegal has a very long and proud farming and agricultural heritage. The diversity of land use within the sector reflects the physical diversity of our landscape. From largely dairy farming in the north to crop growing in the east and throughout the Finn valley to cattle rearing in the south and grazing lands in the west, few counties can boast such a mix and range of farm types. As a rural county, this tradition is not only widely known but widely celebrated because even to this day, the industry remains at the heart of the local economy in many of our smallest villages and towns. The local farmer's mart is at the centre of this industry. Many of our biggest towns such as Letterkenny, the twin towns, Raphoe, Milford, Donegal town, Ballyshannon and others owe much of their success down through the years to the influence of the local livestock co-op or mart. In fact, many of them remain open for business today. They are local trading hubs - institutions in their own right - where farmers and traders come to do business, to socialise and, in most instances, to continue a long and lasting family farming tradition.</p>
            <p eId="para_535"> Despite this, all is not well at the local livestock mart. It is a business which finds itself coming under increasing financial pressures as a direct result of what is fast becoming the cross-sectoral problem of insurance costs. In my view, the same core issues that have caused the rip off for drivers are driving these increases. In recent weeks, I have been contacted by representatives from the sector who have stated in no uncertain terms that the crippling costs associated with rising mart insurance premiums over recent years are forcing mart operators to consider their own futures seriously as well as affecting the future survival of the wider institution itself. Marts are reporting to me that they are coming under heightened demands from their insurers - demands with which they complied in the past and that are still there. Those demands are to introduce costly structural adaptations and changes to existing practice which it is claimed will help keep the cost of cover down. However, even though some marts have already carried out those works, they are seeing dramatic increases in their premiums. Even though they are open for fewer hours than previously, they are seeing the premiums increase year on year. What will the Minister of State do at this stage of the insurance review to ensure that the plight of marts are brought into the terms of reference? I have written to the Minister requesting that. Can the Minister of State comment on the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission investigation? Will he write to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and ask it to look not only at motor insurance but at wider issues, including mart insurance?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Michael D'Arcy)<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_536">I am well aware of Donegal's farming background, which is one of the most mixed and varied in the country. Given Donegal's size in an area where there are challenges, we must do what we can about them. I have been advised by Insurance Ireland that livestock marts have significant exposure to injuries to employees and members of the public. This has resulted in claims occurring with a level of frequency which has led to a reduction in market capacity due to the hazardous nature of the risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> In response, insurers have developed active risk management programmes in order to try to reduce the level of accidents and injuries. In addition, I understand that insurers have been working with marts with a view to implementing improvements in management practices and facilities to reduce claims as this is the key area in terms of managing claim costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> Insurance Ireland has advised that it is not aware of any recent major increases in the cost of insurance for agricultural mart owners. However, if the Deputy is aware of a specific issue facing an individual mart owner, I recommend that he or the mart owner raise it with Insurance Ireland, which I understand is happy to discuss the issue as part of its free insurance information service for those with queries, complaints or difficulties regarding obtaining insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> The Deputy should note that the Minister for Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. Neither the Minister nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products as these matters are of a commercial nature and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits member states from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Consequently, the Minister is not in a position to review individual cases nor to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> Nevertheless, it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the availability and cost of insurance. In terms of measures being taken to tackle the cost of employer and public liability, the Deputy will be aware that this is being examined as part of the second phase of the cost of insurance working group. The working group is building upon the previous work done in the motor phase in order to determine how it can be applied in the employer and public liability insurance claims areas. The working group is also considering the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors, the impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance and other market issues. The working group has held extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, which provided a submission to the working group. This issue was not raised in its submission.</p>
            <p eId="para_541"> It is envisaged that the final results of the second phase will take the form of an addendum to the existing report. As with the first phase, the aim is for all relevant bodies and stakeholders to work together in order to deliver fairer premiums for businesses without unnecessary delay. As it is likely that employer and public liability risks are factors in the cost of insurance for marts, any recommendations emerging from this review should be of relevance to the mart sector. I met with the IFA in Wexford yesterday and raised this issue with it. There are two marts in Wexford and two marts that are very close to the border of Wexford so there are four marts in direct proximity to Wexford but the matter has not been raised with me. However, if there is a specific issue in a specific area, I will certainly take it up to improve matters so that premiums are not unreasonable and unfair.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_542">I appreciate the Minister of State's comments. I will raise this matter with Insurance Ireland and ask the mart owners to do likewise. However, given that he is the Minister of State with responsibility for examining the cost of businesses, and I note his comments about the IFA, I can tell him that the businesses in Donegal with which I have spoken are seeing dramatic increases in their insurance premiums. The Minister of State said the insurance industry is working with the sector to ensure that measures can be taken to reduce the premiums. Many marts have carried out those measures. They have carried out the costly structural adaptations and changes to existing practices but lo and behold, they see their premiums go up when they are due for renewal. For example, despite having spent over €12,000 on introducing such changes, operators of one local mart saw their premiums rise from €8,000 in 2015 to a whopping €15,000 for the period 2017 to 2018. This is an increase of nearly 100% in 24 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_543">That is not sustainable for a mart in a rural area. This is a business which is important and which supports an agricultural sector. Another mart has advised that the costs of its renewal is now a staggering €30,000. This cost is among its biggest overheads for the year and the figure is now unsustainable. It is telling us that it is unsustainable. It has scaled back its operating times and cannot scale back any further. The next step is whether to close the mart. This is particularly the case for smaller marts and co-operatives which operate only a limited number of days. Mart owners simply cannot afford to pay such inordinate insurance premiums and many fear that if the issue is not remedied shortly, it will result in their likely demise and closure. What they are reporting is what we know of, but those in the agriculture sector are at the mercy of a highly concentrated insurance industry which is dominated by a relatively small number of big insurance firms that can charge what they want.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> What can the Minister of State do? He is carrying out the business sector review. His predecessor took on board some of our comments when he appeared before a committee. Independently of what I have said, I ask the Minister of State to take a sample of perhaps 20 marts across the country to see if insurance premiums have increased dramatically and to look at that when engaging with the sector.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_323" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael D'Arcy<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_545">I did that earlier. I telephoned two of the marts in the area closest to me. The cost for one of the largest marts in the country is approximately €12,500 and its owner said its premium had not increased. I anticipated the question would be about why premiums had increased. The owner said its premium had not increased because he had not had a claim for 12 years. That is the primary issue I see. When I pushed him about his knowledge of other marts, he said from what he has been told, the cost to insure a moderate-sized mart is between €20,000 to €25,000. I take on board the Deputy's assertion that there is probably a bigger issue where premiums for smaller marts, which operate on a smaller number of days and which have a smaller turnover, go from €8,000 to €15,000, thus experiencing a really significant jump. It is concerning in the extreme if they have done the work required to insure there are no claims or where they have done the work if there were issues to be resolved. I have a real problem with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> If the Deputy supplies me with the details, I will pursue the matter. I will also take it to the next phase of insurance analysis. The marts are crucial and are an essential part of rural Ireland in terms of trade. It is not just the marts because there are shops and other services attached to them. I am from rural Ireland and an agricultural background and do not want to see any further slippage in this sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_547">I thank the Minister for making himself available to take this issue. Will he seriously consider, as part of the capital programme, which I presume will be announced when we come back after the summer recess, funding the N24 to motorway standard? This road connects Limerick and Waterford. This is a very valid proposal and given where we are with regard to the national spatial strategy and the national planning framework, which, coincidentally, I kicked off myself a couple of years ago, this would fit right into the plans and requirements set out in them. It also fits into the plans set out in the submission from County Tipperary as part of that and also submissions and plans from the south east. The local authorities of Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny have written to the Minister and made a submission on this motorway proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_548"> We need the motorway in order to open up the south of the country. Not only would it link Cork, Limerick, Waterford and all the towns in between, it would link the ports of Rosslare, Waterford, Limerick, Foynes and Cork. Based on my knowledge as a former MEP, I think there is potential for funding from the Trans-European Transport Networks, TEN-T, programme because this would link up all the ports and in doing so, meet all its requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> The current N24 is substandard. It links many towns in Tipperary, including Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town, with many others. It has slow journey times. It would be a game-changer because it would link up the whole southern region. It would also open up Shannon Airport as an access point. Furthermore, it would create the possibility of opening the M8 and linking it with the M7.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> The Minister has decisions to make on capital funding which will be tight. He will be under pressure in regard to requirements in Dublin, which are also all valid. I was in his Department a number of years ago when similar decisions had to be made and when our envelope was much smaller.</p>
            <p eId="para_551"> Will the Minister consider doing this motorway? If he cannot do the whole motorway, will he consider doing a component of it? The cost associated with linking up Limerick with the M8, for example, would come in at €500 million or thereabouts. The cost associated with doing the Cork to Limerick road would be much higher and that is a very worthy project in its own right, but the Minister is obviously going to have to fit the projects within the envelope he has.</p>
            <p eId="para_552"> This is a fantastic project that would tick all the boxes in regard to the Action Plan for Jobs, the plans for opening up rural Ireland and regionality. IDA Ireland and those looking to bring investment into this country would be very excited if the Minister could go some way to funding this road to bring it to motorway standard, whether by upgrading the road or, probably more likely, building a new road. In the coming months will the Minister consider this favourably, if at all possible?</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_553">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important subject. He will be aware that I cannot make any commitment at this stage and that he is putting a case which is competing with many others in what is not a bottomless pit. I acknowledge the fact he has made a very good case for upgrading the N24, in particular when he mentioned the spatial strategy, which is important, and the fact the road is undoubtedly substandard. I point out to him, because I do not want to raise expectations and I have had a multitude of requests about roads, that we really have not been able to do anything to even keep up with the steady state in recent years and that will not happen until 2019 or 2020. We are coming from behind but, as the Deputy said, the capital review will I hope release capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_554"> The N24 services the cities of Limerick and Waterford. The route originates at the junction of the N24 and the N7 at Henry Street in the city of Limerick and terminates at the junction of the N9 and N25 at the Brother Ignatius Rice Bridge in Waterford city. The overall route length of the N24 is approximately 120 km. An approximate breakdown of the route length by local authority means that the largest stretch of the route is in the Deputy's home county of Tipperary. A number of significant upgrades to the N24 were being planned before the financial crisis but were, unfortunately, suspended at route selection stage due to lack of funding. These included the Bansha-Tipperary-Oola bypass, the Cahir-Bansha road, the Carrick-on-Suir bypass, the Clonmel-Cahir bypass and the Mooncoin bypass. The Government's capital investment plan, building on recovery, infrastructure and capital investment, provides the financial and strategic framework for Transport Infrastructure Ireland's, TII, activities during the period from 2016 to 2021. The N24 was not included among those projects which were identified for development during the period of the plan. However, as the Deputy is aware, mid-term review of the capital investment plan is being undertaken by the Government and the position on the development of the route will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the review and any additional funding priorities that may be identified by the Government for the national roads programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">The Department's submission, as part of the capital plan review, includes provision for the development of a project pipeline for national roads. Among the projects included in the pipeline is an upgrade of one section of the N24, from Cahir to Limerick Junction, which is 27 km. The capital review process is under way and decisions on the outcome will be made before budget 2018.</p>

            <p eId="para_556">The Minister and I have had our differences in the past on a range of issues. One matter on which I have great sympathy for him is the issue of roads and capital spending because there will never be enough funding. Obviously, he has other competing capital public transport projects across Dublin and other cities. I was in that Department and have sympathy for him.</p>
            <p eId="para_557"> I will ventilate some issues for the Minister to put into the mix. This opens up together all the ports across the south of Ireland. Given our issues in regard to a range of other areas, including climate change, that should be considered. Second, it opens up Shannon Airport. It meets our spatial strategy plans. We cannot continue developing this country based on the conurbation around Dublin. We need to open up other parts of the country and I believe turning this into an motorway, even if we have to do it in stages, is critical in order to achieve it.</p>
            <p eId="para_558"> I very much welcome what the Minister said. I am taking it as a move in the right direction that, in consideration of upgrading the road from the Cahir on the M8 to Limerick Junction, which is a road desperately in need of being upgraded, it allows a continuation of the M8 motorway on to Limerick Junction and then from a road from Limerick Junction into Limerick, which is not as bad as the other area. I implore the Minister. Even if he could countenance doing that component of it, that would be welcome. It would open up that part of the country and allow for continuation of the work when more funding is available. I encourage the Minister to do that. I believe it would open up the whole area, particularly a part of the country that has not had infrastructural investment. There are serious issues, for instance, in Tipperary town and the surrounding areas. We need to allow for greater investment in that whole area and this would do so. Even if the Minister were to look on it favourably, it would be welcomed by all sides of the House.</p>

            <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_559">I will, of course, look on it as favourably as I possibly can. I am glad the Deputy, who has been in this position, realises that the competing considerations are overwhelming in this case, particularly as the capital plan looms and decisions have to be made in the autumn. I will certainly bear in mind what he said about the ports and Shannon Airport. They are strong points.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> The plan provides for a gradual build up of capital funding towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works. It will, however, take some years yet to restore the steady State funding levels for land transport. There will be a significant increase in funding from 2020 which will facilitate the construction of the national road improvement projects included in the plan. While available funding is not sufficient to address all the demands for improvement schemes, including schemes such as the upgrade of the N24, by the end of the plan period I expect that capital funding for the road network will be back up to the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_561"> As regards the possibility of additional funding within the plan period for national road projects, the capital plan review process is under way and my Department is making a strong case for extra funding to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including the development of a project pipeline for national road schemes. The final decisions on allocations are, however, matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government as a whole.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_14"> Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_562">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. I congratulate Deputy Charles Flanagan on his appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality. I thank him for his co-operation while Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I had a few difficult issues trying to get passports and a few matters over the line and thank the Minister and his office for what he was able to do for me at the time. I wish him well in his new appointment because it is a challenging role.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> If I might be so bold, this legislation might not be one of the Minister's priorities. My party has looked at it - Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, our spokesperson, has gone through it in great detail - and formed the opinion that it is unnecessary at this time to spend time debating this legislation. If one looks at various aspects of the legislation and the reasons it is before the House, all one can see is that it is an ego trip and that it is not necessary. If I reflect what the people of Cork North-West are saying to me on a daily basis, it is about neither the appointment of the judges, nor how members of the Judiciary have been appointed since independence in the 1920s.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> The Judiciary has stood the test of time. The method of appointment of members of the Judiciary in the past 22 years has involved a selection process. Following the debacle of the appointment of a High Court judge in 1994, there was new legislation. That legislation, no more than the system that was there in terms of Government appointment, involved the Executive having the sole responsibility for appointing judges. If one examines that through the decades, there have been many fine persons appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The language being used suggests there was some kind of cosy cartel between the politicians and the legal profession out of which judges were appointed. However, given the system of appointment, the reality is that the court system has served the country extremely well.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Let us consider any comparison throughout the European Union, the developed world or any system that has measured our judicial appointments or the system that has led from the appointments of the Judiciary. They have been well received throughout the world. We have been seen as having appointed excellent judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Many people have served on the Bench and have made difficult and controversial decisions on a raft of issues, but they have always taken the letter of the law. They have taken what we have presented to them as the Oireachtas or by way of referendum. They have taken the law and conscientiously gone through it. It is peculiar to think that we are now debating at length this legislation because there is somehow some flaw in the way our judicial appointments are made. When I talk to the ordinary person on the street I sense the utmost respect for the judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> Many facets or aspects of Irish society in the past 20, 25 or 30 years have definitely been challenged. The establishment and some aspects of church and State that had been held on a pedestal for many decades have been challenged. However, the one that has served us throughout is the judicial system. When we see people challenging the judicial system, they are always challenging judgments that went against them. It is by far the better way that judicial appointments have been made. Therefore, we have appointed singularly capable people to the Benches of all the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> We are now left with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. I respectfully suggest there are far more important issues that need to be debated on the floor of the House before we head into the summer recess. Such issues are pressing on the minds of people. We had a debate in the House earlier on respite care in County Louth. The way the respite care system for people with disabilities or the elderly has been run could be extended to the entire country. Over the weekend many parents expressed considerable concern on the matter. Such bread-and-butter issues are affecting every family throughout the country, yet they are not jazzed-up enough, sexy enough or controversial enough to bring to the floor of Dáil Éireann. They are seen as mundane issues. However, these are not mundane issues for families at the receiving end of these services. People ask me at my clinic on a Friday, Saturday or Monday to raise these issues. Then, I say the whole week is given over to judicial appointments. The people concerned have the same reverence for the judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> The judges in turn go through the legislation that they are charged with and they ensure they give judgments. We have seen many cases, although I have no wish to comment on any individual case - that is not my remit as a Member of the Oireachtas. We have seen many cases with commentary. As a case is going on, it is reported in the media. Judgments are made in terms of how a case is going to conclude and whether persons are going to be found guilty of the offence or found not guilty of the offence. There is debate on the length of time that is going through it.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> We see the judicial system works in the way the jury is appointed and the way advice is given by the judges to the jury. They always ensure they are implementing the law properly. The Houses of the Oireachtas should applaud the system in place. We should applaud the way that the judges have been appointed and how they have administered, by and large, the courts system. Of course there needs to be further change as time passes. We can go back to the 1937 Constitution since the provisions were first put into the Constitution. We should look at how better to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> This Bill is unnecessary at this time. There are some words in it. It is completely and absolutely unnecessary at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> From the crash in 2008 right through to now, many fine people have spoken <i>ad nauseam</i> on radio and television and in the Houses of the Oireachtas about quangos, the number of quangos, the cost to the State of these quangos and the number of people appointed to these quangos. There was discussion on how to reduce and minimise the bureaucracy. Bureaucracy had created a major cost to industry and to society whether in the services sector or elsewhere. "Quangos" was the buzz-word. The front of the Sunday newspapers ran stories on how more quangos must be reduced, scrapped or done away with. The 2011 election was to be a reforming election that was going to turn the world on its head. The first thing that was going to be done by the most reforming of candidates was the getting rid of quangos. There was no longer going to be toleration in society of quangos. Let us suppose we wanted to press that issue or go through the commentary on that issue. What quangos would we get rid of or cut? An bord snip nua was looking at quangos with a view to getting rid of them in 2008 and 2009 after the crash. What are we doing here and now with this legislation? We are creating another quango. We find fault in how judges have been appointed. We find fault with how the letter of the law and the legislation has been applied to the nth degree since 1995. How do with find fault with it? We create another quango.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> Other issues arise and I want to develop them also. One of the main issues that people have in society was discussed here earlier. It relates to the insurance industry and how the cost of insurance has quadrupled or doubled in recent months. Today, we learned of various investigations by the European Commission into how insurance and the cost of insurance is being applied. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was put in place 20 years ago or more to try to reduce the cost of insurance. We were to look at other jurisdictions and we were supposed to mirror the legislation on the basis of what people were advising. Reference was made to Scotland and some other parts of the British Isles and Europe. However, we are not looking at best practice there in respect of our insurance industry. We are not looking at how to minimise cost or how the cost can be minimised for the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Next week we will debate Report and Final Stages of legislation predominately. That has been the tradition since I came to the House. Legislation is developed over a period and then it comes to the final week. It is brought in to ensure it is passed on Report and Final Stages such that it can be sent to the Seanad before the summer recess. We are now in the second last week of the session and we are debating legislation that has been put into three or four periods of Government time. This legislation will not be enacted before the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> We need to look at what is being proposed and ask whether there is such urgency about it. What is being proposed is not going to help our cause as Ireland Inc. The most important question that we should ask as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas with every tranche of legislation is whether in five or ten years it is going to improve the livelihoods of ourselves or our citizens. Ultimately, as Members of the Oireachtas, we are sent to the Dáil as Teachtaí Dála, as messengers of the Dáil. Our job is to ensure we serve the people, whether they live in Cork North-West, Dublin, Donegal or Laois, and that we bring the basic message in respect of what people want. As in any republic, we are here at the behest of the people to represent the people. We are here to represent them to the best of our ability.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> What is to be gained by adding further layers of bureaucracy? Let us go back over the years and consider any assessment of legislation that was taken in this House. There is one thread running through all of it: rushed or hurried legislation or legislation taken because of a specific issue, a political issue or because of someone's vanity ends up being poor legislation, by and large. Legislation should be teased out. People should make honest contributions every time in terms of how they want to proceed and how they want to see the best for society. What we are trying to do as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, no more than in ordinary life, is ensure the Ireland we leave after us is better for the next generation and the generation after that.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">As we spend three or four days discussing this legislation far more important issues in the education and health sectors are being sidelined to put through this vanity project.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> Fianna Fáil is opposed to the Bill because we believe it is unnecessary at this point. In the past week or ten days, many fine commentators have reviewed this legislation. By and large, the view is that judicial appointments are at the behest of politicians and that only persons connected to senior politicians can hope to be appointed to the Judiciary. When one forensically examines the system, one finds that since the foundation of the State all of the very fine appointees to the Judiciary, by all of the political parties, including Cearhball Ó Dálaigh, excelled as court judges and they served the State well. In terms of this legislation, we will no longer be allowed to appoint people to the Judiciary because it might be tainted if the appointees are in some way associated with politics. The Executive appoints the Judiciary. That is sacrosanct in the Constitution. It is the methodology of appointments that is in question. There has been a rush to denigrate appointments made in the past, despite the fact that those appointed have been excellent judges. They took the oath and they have carried out their roles responsibly, whether in the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court or any other court to which they were appointed. </p>
          <p eId="para_580"> Politics and politicians are held in poor regard throughout the country. Truth be told, there are many people who wish with the strike of one match they could do away with the Members of this House and all others who practise politics, be that on local authorities or in the Seanad. Democracy is praiseworthy. It is the best form of government to ensure that people are held accountable. We are all aware of the many dictatorships across the world and of the poverty and suffering therein of men, women and children. Two years ago, when a picture of a child in one dictatorship was shown on the front page of the newspapers there was outrage. We do not cherish democracy in this country. We should praise people who have been appointed to the Judiciary because they have not been challenged in terms of the decisions they have made. They have made very fine decisions and issued fine judgments. I refer members to the cases of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six across the water. We did not have similar cases here because our judges were thorough in terms of how they implemented and practised the law. It is a disservice to us as politicians and a disservice to democracy and the Judiciary to say there is a need to take the grubby hand of politicians away from the appointment of judges because such appointments would be tainted and so on. We should be firm in our praise of judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> In regard to free legal aid, there has been outcry in regard to the manner in which it is granted. The free legal aid system was established to assist the many people who were involved in family disputes or needed to defend themselves from scurrilous accusations and so on but were unable to access the courts because of the cost of legal proceedings. There are people who are questioning the availability of free legal aid. Rather than putting in place another quango, as provided for in this legislation, we should be discussing legislation to ensure a fairer distribution of free legal aid and greater transparency around that process. We do not need more quangos. There is no necessity for this quango which is proposed by the same people who, in articles in the public press in 2008, 2009 and 2010, said that this country was being run by quangos and that the decisions being made by quangos were not implemented by politicians being held accountable and so forth. Over the next number of days, as we did last week, we will be debating legislation that seeks to establish another quango that will cost multiples of the cost of the current system of appointment of judges. Perhaps somebody will point me to the flaw in the current system and why it is necessary to make this change. Is this a vanity project, an ego trip or is it genuinely needed by the people to ensure that we have more rather than less respect for the Judiciary? </p>
          <p eId="para_582"> While places such as Kanturk or Charleville or anywhere else are faced with many challenges, top of their list is not appointments to the Judiciary or the practices of the Judiciary. This is far from their minds. We in this House are duty bound to reflect on the concerns of citizens and to act accordingly by introducing legislation, such as legislation to ensure people receive proper respite care and so on. I know of families who have not received respite care for three or four years. Is that not as important or more important than the legislation we are discussing tonight? It is more important, as is the lack of roll-out of broadband across rural communities. I could speak here for the next 40 minutes about all of the issues we should be debating rather than this unnecessary legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_583">"The lady doth protest too much, methinks" is a quote from Hamlet, which has been around now for 400 years. It is still referenced today because it is very pertinent and true. It is also relevant to this debate. Although the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is in the Chamber, the driving force behind this Bill is undoubtedly his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross. His rationale for this legislation is that he wants to take on the judges and, as per his rationale in regard to other crusades on which he has been on during his time in politics, to take on the establishment, do away with the insider appointments and shake things up. This is the constant theme behind what drives the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, in politics. I wonder if the Minister doth protest too much because having been a Member of the Seanad for many years since the early 1980s he is not exactly an outsider. Indeed, he would qualify as an archetypal insider. One wonders why it is he wants to rail against others and constantly protests that he is not an insider.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, is also the leader of the Independent group. During the election campaigns in 2011 and 2016 there was such a surge of support for the Independents they told everyone when they were elected they would seek to change politics for the better and deliver for the public. Following the last general election many of them got their opportunity to enter Government but they decided not to do so and they scattered four sheets to the wind. In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and some of his colleagues stepped up to the mark and decided to go into government.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">One year on, as we come to the end of this Dáil term, what does the Minister have to show for himself? What legislation are the Independents in government choosing to expedite with their political capital? It is the Bill dealing with the way in which judges are appointed with which we are dealing today and which took up a good deal of Dáil time last week. As the Minister and I both know, that issue was not raised in the general election campaign, nor was it seen as a problem by many of the electorate, yet for the Minister, it is the one item of legislation on which he is hanging his hat. As such, it is his signature piece.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Ireland has made a very strong bid to host the Rugby World Cup. We are told by the Minister concerned that the legislation to enable that to happen is very important. We will deal with it before the end of this Dáil term, but why was it not prioritised by the Minister, instead of the legislation before the House?</p>

          <p eId="para_588">It is because he wants to continue the crusade which has been his hallmark in recent times and throughout his career. He wants to get big headlines. He knows that the media, if no one else, will cover his attack on the judges. There are column inches in it, which is particularly attractive to him. Unfortunately, for many years he has been riding his white horse and conducting several moral crusades. However, as we have seen since he got into government, the white horse has been put out to grass and instead he is on the pig's back in terms of having a Cabinet seat and he is very much enjoying the experience. He has arrived at a Cabinet position, unfortunately from the public's point of view, but we are not seeing the delivery of any serious measure from him. We are not seeing any leadership or getting any insight from him on what he wants to deliver in his Department. Instead, we have seen him being willing to meddle in other issues, including majoring in this issue, but showing no willingness to grasp the opportunity he has received as a Cabinet Minister to make a real difference in the portfolio he was given. For example, delivery in the areas of transport, tourism and sport has been minimal. The interest he has shown in those areas has been little to none. We waited several months before there was any plan of action from him, other than items from other Departments which interested him but none from his Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> On recent replies to parliamentary questions from my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, about the Open Skies agreement, the Minister has not been engaging in any dedicated way with fellow Ministers from other European nations to try to protect it. I see no interest being shown by him in transport projects in my constituency of Donegal. We have a number of key projects that need to be moved on, yet he prefers to focus on an issue such as the one before us rather than, say, the need for a bypass around Letterkenny, a major town in my county, the need for a link road between Letterkenny and Lifford, or to progress the A5 project from Derry to Monaghan. He has shown no interest in such projects. </p>
          <p eId="para_590"> On tourism, we are not seeing anything of import coming from the Minister. There is nothing additional with respect to new investment in the Wild Atlantic Way. I have raised regularly on the floor of the House the need for an investment package in my county to exploit the potential offered by the <i>National Geographic</i> magazine in announcing Donegal as the coolest place on the planet in 2017. This helps greatly in promoting the county and presents an opportunity for the Government to invest in it to develop its undeveloped tourism product, yet nothing has been forthcoming from the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> If it is to be the Department of Justice and Equality that is to take up time on the floor of the Dáil, I advise the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, that we should be focusing on the Garda. We should be spending time debating the need for Garda resources and proper garda deployment, an issue I have raised as it affects my county. We have seen a 20% reduction in the number of gardaí in the period from 2010. We had 480 gardaí previously, but the number is now just over 380. Of the 1,000 new Garda recruits since 2014, only 17 have come to County Donegal. I have corresponded with the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the issue. I use this opportunity to highlight the need for the reduction to be addressed as new Garda recruits graduate. Given that only 17 of the previous 1,000 garda recruits were allocated to County Donegal, the reduction needs to be addressed. The emphasis needs to be placed on addressing gaps in the system. I have no doubt that Donegal is not unlike a number of other counties in terms of the pressure gardaí are under, but the problem is particularly acute in my county because of the pressure of policing the Border with Northern Ireland, a problem that is not recognised. Many Border stations, in particular, have been starved of gardaí. It is impossible for the Garda force to offer the type of service expected and that the people require. Over the course of the confidence and supply agreement, the objective is that the Garda force will reach 13,500. I continue to liaise with the Minister to emphasise the need to address the under-resourcing of the Garda force in County Donegal in meeting that objective. </p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Instead of addressing that issue we are dealing with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and a massive amount of Government time is being devoted to the debate. I make the point which was made by all of my colleagues that Fianna Fáil recognises the need to reform and improve the process by which judicial appointments are made. In that regard, my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, brought forward a Bill more than a year ago to achieve that objective. It is a superior Bill to the one brought forward by the Government. Despite the fact that it was introduced in the Dáil more than a year ago, the Government did not move to facilitate it being discussed at justice committee level by issuing the money order required for that debate to take place on Committee Stage. It was remiss in not doing so. Now there is a panic and a big push by it to deal with this Bill that was brought forward at the behest of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and on which a great deal of Dáil time is being spent. One has to ask why that is the case. It goes back to the Cabinet's decision, taken at the former Taoiseach's last Cabinet meeting, to proceed with the appointment of the Attorney General, without her submitting an application to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board while she sat at the Cabinet table, to the Court of Appeal.. Meanwhile the Minister was happy to sit at the Cabinet table and nod the decision through, yet when the heat was on, we saw him revert to his crusade to clean up politics and the way judges were appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The Minister had to restrain himself from laughing when the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, in defence of himself after the appointment had been made, said how dare anyone else criticise him when he was only doing what others had done before him. That is a long way from what he campaigned on and from his main crusade. He let his mask slip. He had the comfort of a Cabinet seat and being at the Cabinet table when the decision was made. The decision of someone not being appointed through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, was helped by getting Stepaside Garda station reopened. The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, was quite happy to agree to that thinking that it might well go through on the nod. However, when he realised the public was not buying it, he reverted to type and went out to the plinth to criticise his own decision and look for a review of how the Cabinet made the appointment despite the fact he fully supported the decision at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> One of the key differences between the Fianna Fáil Bill and the one proposed by the Government is that our legislation requires the judicial appointments commission to give a preferential order in regard to the nominees it recommends to the Cabinet. That is something any reasonable person would think is an improvement. When one goes to the trouble of asking a commission to vet and conduct interviews and assessments on candidates' suitability, it follows and is logical that one would ask it to rank them in order of preference, based on its view and assessment of the most qualified candidates. It has been pointed out that one of the weaknesses of the current system is that a number of names can go forward to the Cabinet with fairly limited information about their suitability and without being ranked. It is then left to the Cabinet to decide without the full information available to help it make its decision. The proposal put forward by the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Government restricts it to three names but, as before, those three names would not be ranked. That is a weakness in the legislation being proposed and one which does not make sense. Under the Constitution, the responsibility for making the appointment must always rest with the Cabinet and it is entirely within its remit to appoint anyone, even outside of the list of nominations provided to it. When it is provided with the list, it should include details of the order of preference of the commission or board making the recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The other key difference is the treatment of those with a legal or judicial background. There has been much focus on this not least because members of the Judiciary have come out publicly on the point that the Government's Bill does not have the Chief Justice as the chairperson of the commission, the role being held instead by a lay person. Also, the President of the High Court and the President of the District Court are not full members of the commission. The Bill expresses a strong preference for people who do not have a legal background. As with any other profession, one needs experience to be able to decide who is capable and best suited to carrying out roles, and that applies to the legal profession. Under the legislation Fianna Fáil proposes, while there would be a non-judicial majority on the commission, there is clear identification of who those lay members should be. For instance, it includes representatives of the Legal Aid Board and Citizens Information Board, people who have a role and something to contribute to the process. There is a clear purpose behind why those people are there. The clarity in our legislation is welcome. This is a flaw in the Government's legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> I urge the Minister to take on board the amendments proposed by this side of the House and to look at the structure of Fianna Fáil's legislation which we believe is superior. I reiterate to the Government and the House our disappointment that this is the Bill on which the Government is majoring, albeit at the behest of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross. It is a poor reflection on the Government that this is its signature legislation for this Dáil term, coming from the Independent branch of the Government. It certainly does not reflect the mandate it was given by the public or the platform on which it campaigned in the recent election when it sought the electorate's support.</p>

        <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_332">
          <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_597">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation. I will take the opportunity to wish the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, well in his new role. He will bring much energy and vigour to the role. He was a justice spokesperson at one time. That was before he backed the wrong horse but he has landed into the hot seat now and I wish him well. He was taken out of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at a crucial juncture and events in the North are not moving satisfactorily. The Minister made a positive contribution to same.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> To return to the business at hand, if any Member came into the House and called someone a fraud it would be wrong, especially if the person was not a Member of the House. It is fair to lay the charge that someone who is a Member of the House is a political fraud. The actions of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, in his crusade, the debate around judicial appointments and the dishonest misrepresentation on which he has campaigned over the years are very concerning to me and many right-minded people. This is a man who has authored a book on the Judiciary and judicial appointments and ran a campaign for so long, describing the Judiciary as untouchable elites, taking every opportunity to unfairly denigrate our Judiciary. I am not saying everything is hunky-dory with the Judiciary. There are challenges but there are challenges in every section in our public service. We all have an obligation and a responsibility to address those issues. A judicial appointments commission is badly required and there should be more training for judges and more diversity but to build a campaign and follow it through with proposed legislation is very concerning. I will not forget some of the commentary I heard after the last general election when the Independent Alliance was in consultation with Fine Gael to form a Government and there were various doorstep interviews outside Government Buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">This was at a time when there were and still are so many issues for discussion, such as homelessness, and we can go right down the line to include water, provision of housing and pay inequality. Deputy Shane Ross had his Independent Alliance colleagues standing in front of Government Buildings telling the nation that what was between the negotiating parties was the appointment of members of the Judiciary. It is interesting that during my time as justice spokesman this came up for debate over the years. Everybody's starting point in the debate was that we have a very fine Judiciary and we are lucky to have such an independent and a fair-minded Judiciary. People praise the current complement of people serving us on the Bench before ridiculing or decrying the system, in which everything is wrong. They argue the system is compromised but at the same time we appear to be fortunate to have the Judiciary we have. It is staggering hypocrisy.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> I agree with other speakers. The Rugby World Cup bid Bill is of immense importance but it has been relegated to second place in terms of priority this week, despite the major impact the event could have on this country. Apart from the criticism I have levelled at the Minister, Deputy Ross, for his crusade against judges and the Judiciary, one can ask what he has achieved outside of this within his Department. He threw a lousy €1 million to my part of the country to restart the programme for construction for the much needed M20 motorway to link Cork and Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> I can give another example of the blatant hypocrisy with which he operates. There is a very significant commercial semi-State port in my constituency, the Shannon-Foynes Port Company. I have been told that either at the end of this month or certainly within a number of short weeks, its board will not have a quorum and thus unable to conduct meetings in a legal sense. I submitted a parliamentary question in this regard with reference to all State agencies under the remit of the great Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, a number of months ago and there is a raft of vacancies. What is going on? These are agencies of State with obligations under company law and many other headings but they find themselves with corporate structures being fundamentally undermined by the inaction of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross. He has stated applications are with the Public Appointments Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> There is another matter running in parallel to that problem. A person presented before the committee on which I sit, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who was designated to chair the Health and Safety Authority. He is a very competent and able individual. We had an engagement with him prior to him taking up his post. I had no issue with his competence or ability to do his job. I wish him well and I am sure he is doing a very good job. He told the committee that he was not interviewed for the post at all and he just applied online before he was offered the job. That leads to other questions about the system of appointments to State boards. Is there now a scenario where we cannot have oversight or transparency in how the Public Appointments Service runs processes and competitions to fill these positions? One would imagine at the very least there would be an interview but there was not in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> I would like to be discussing other matters with the Minister instead of the judicial appointments process. For example, there is the major problem with free legal aid. It is a demand-led scheme, as the Minister knows, but week in, week out in my constituency I must deal with problems of access for marginalised and vulnerable people with regard to the civil arm of the free legal aid scheme. Criminal free legal aid is absolutely dominant in budget terms and it is an area we must examine fundamentally. There are battered spouses and people coming from other abusive relationships who need to seek redress or support in the courts but they cannot because when they apply for civil free legal aid, they are locked out or put on a waiting list on the never-never. It is not really good enough in this day and age as these people's lives are so negatively impacted on. We can compare this with the hardened criminal availing of the service on a continuous basis over weeks and months for offence after offence. I know that there is the constitutional matter of having the right to a fair defence. I would much rather see us discussing that subject tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Another matter pertaining to the Minister's Department that we must take seriously is the undocumented population in this country. The Migrant Rights Council of Ireland tells us, correctly, that there is anywhere between 26,000 and 30,000 undocumented workers in the Irish shadow economy. Apart from those people being vulnerable, exploited and unable to avail of the protection we have in the labour force, they are also suppressing wage rates because of their work in the shadow economy, which has an impact on people working in the official economy. It is an area that comes within the Minister's remit. We published a Bill during the previous Dáil to regularise the undocumented and there was a presentation at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation today from the International Transport Workers Federation trade union, which represents people working in the fishing industry. It is truly shocking to hear of the exploitation of a large number of workers in that industry and, in particular, a large number of undocumented workers. We should be discussing such topics rather than this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> The differences between this Bill and the legislation proposed by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, is what is coming between our parties. Nobody is against reform and the process must be reformed. The key significant differences should be noted, including the ranking of names being forwarded. There should be a ranking of first, second and third. There should also be an obligation on the Government to give a reasoned explanation if any names are not put forward. The Bill emanating from the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, makes a mockery of trying to remove the political patronage or interference he alleges from the judicial appointments process. The Bill just has the provision for three names that can be rejected out of hand without a reason before going the other route. At least with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill, there must be a ranking of first, second and third.</p>

          <p eId="para_609">The first person might not take the job. There are plenty of reasons for such a ranking process. I am just pointing to the hypocrisy. What has the Government got against the Chief Justice who is an independent and reputable person and officeholder in this country?</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Were the President to become incapacitated, under the Constitution, the Chief Justice would form one of the backfills, so to speak, for that vacancy in a temporary capacity, yet the Government and the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, believe the Chief Justice should be relegated in that process, which is very worrying. If he has not already done so, the Minister might explain the reason the Government has moved away from the Chief Justice in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> There is no doubt that the Minister is establishing a quango. Truth be told, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board sits neatly as a sub-set of the Courts Service. When the Taoiseach sat on this side of the House, I recall him making a campaign out of the need to cull quangos. That is a fair criticism. I cannot recall the exact numbers he cited at the time, but he and his party were going to do the devil and all to deal with what he described as the proliferation of quangos, yet here we are establishing another quango.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> The controversy about the appointment of the former Attorney General to the Court of Appeal was not properly explained to any of us. The Minister should take the opportunity to do so. Why did the former Attorney General not excuse herself from the process? Why did she not apply in the normal fashion, as provided for under the existing legislation, to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and be approved for appointment were she to meet the criteria? Apart from assessing candidates' suitability and qualifications, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board assesses other issues such as tax compliance, for example. Anybody who applies to the board must be able to furnish proof of tax compliance, including up-to-date tax clearance certificates. Was any of that background checking done as part of the appointment process? That is a fair question and I do not mean it to be personal. The appointment was discussed, but that aspect did not arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> The appointment of the lay people who are to sit on the judicial commission represents the major difference between us and the Government. We have made the point that non-medics would not be appointed to select medics. People with qualifications, experience and a background in the area are needed to do this. In terms of the backgrounds of the persons who should sit on the commission, the Bill Deputy Jim O'Callaghan brought forward was the right way forward. Incidentally, the Legal Services Regulation Bill which was passed by the previous Dáil drew from the same complement of persons in terms of people who were considered competent in the area of law, justice and advocacy matters. I do not understand why the Minister will not consider people from the Bar Council, the Law Society, the Citizens Information Board, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Human Rights and Equality Commission and the free legal advice centres, FLAC. That is something he has to take on board because we cannot have a situation where people who know nothing about the operation of the law or the criminal justice system are sitting on the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> There is something else we should bear in mind. Who will choose the people in question? Ultimately, they will be politically appointed, which gives the lie to the way the Minister is trying to remove political influence from the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> To return to my point about the backgrounds from which people who will sit on the commission should come, it was very clever of Deputy Jim O'Callaghan to outline in his Bill the calibre of person who should be appointed as a judge. He referenced integrity, independence of mind, moral courage, a high level of intellectual skill, sound temperament, common sense, impartiality, objectivity, fairness and equanimity. He rightly pointed out that not everybody would possess all of these skills, but what he outlined would go a long way towards dealing with the criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> The point my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, and my party leader have made on a number of occasions represents the right position to take from our point of view, namely, that this new quango that the Minister is proposing, with its lay majority appointed through a political process, will not achieve what the Minister has set out to achieve in removing what he calls political influence from the process. We all recognise that is the Government's choice, but if in the future Fianna Fáil believes it is not working, we are indicating our right to change the legislation if we find ourselves on the Minister's side of the House. That is something with which I agree.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">I, too, want to be associated with the expressions of good will to the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on his new appointment. He is a man of great experience. He is well suited to his new role in which I wish him well. On that note, he must sit uneasily with this legislation that has been put before him, given the background and history of the Minister who is pushing it in Cabinet. It must sit uneasily with a man of the Minister's experience. If the issues highlighted by Fianna Fáil are not of concern to him - I will revert to them shortly - he must surely be concerned about those who are supporting the Bill. Those in the ranks of Sinn Féin are pushing the Bill and supporting the Minister on it. That must sit very uneasily with him. If that is not enough to point out that the Bill is seriously flawed, I do not know what is. We in Fianna Fáil believe there is a need to reform the judicial appointments process. However, the Bill is flawed. I do not want to repeat what has been said, but not having the Chief Justice as chairperson of the commission does not make sense. This is poor, flawed legislation and I ask the Minister to examine it closely and amend same. Also, it is farcical that the Presidents of the District Court and the Circuit Court will not be members of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> On recommending three people but not pushing forward one over another, in any job for which someone applies there is always a preferred candidate. That is the way it should be because it works. This proposal is unworkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Without wishing to rehash everything that has been said by my colleagues in the past few hours, I ask the Minister, as a man of integrity and experience, to seriously examine the issues we have pointed out to him and look at the people who are supporting him on this legislation, their record on the judicial system and the way they have disrespected it for many years. He should bring forward the necessary amendments to make the Bill workable and worthwhile because in its current format it is not workable or worthwhile.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_621">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on his appointment and wish him luck. It is obviously a challenging portfolio in which there have been crises in the six years I have been involved in politics. I genuinely wish him good luck as he has his work cut out for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> I have to confess that when all of this kicked off a few weeks ago, I knew as much as most people about the appointment of judges, which was next to nothing. I knew that the Cabinet made decisions and that there had been political influence in the appointment of judges for many years. I had a vague sense that the process needed to be reformed, but I have to admit that it is not an area I really knew. In the past few weeks, therefore, I have been listening to Dáil debates and commentary in the media and, in preparation for the debate on the Bill before the House, I looked in more detail at the Minister, Deputy Ross' Bill - the Government's proposed Bill - and also at Fianna Fáil's proposal, which is being led by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, whom I commend for what appears to be a serious piece of legislative work.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> There is agreement among the majority of the House, possibly all of it, that the judicial appointments process needs to be reformed. Unfortunately, my reading of the Bill and the expert analysis of it is that it will not achieve the reforms needed. That, ultimately, is the problem. I do not believe the Bill should be supported by the Government or the Oireachtas. It would be very peculiar if it was voted through by a combination of the Government and Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Under the current process, when a vacancy comes up, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board advertises the post. It receives job applications from lawyers, as only they are allowed to apply to be judges. The board then determines who is suitable for the role. This is important. It does not provide guidance on who it believes is best for the role and does not rank the names on the list it sends to the Cabinet. Its job, essentially, is filtering out who is a suitable lawyer for appointment to the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Court of Appeal. It provides the list for the Cabinet which then deliberates. Interestingly, I read commentary by Dick Spring who said that when he was a member of the Cabinet and asked to go through a long list of lawyers for appointment to the Bench, he had no idea who the best candidates were or who might not be good candidates, even though they might be eligible for the job. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board essentially sends a letter to the Cabinet which chooses from the list.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> I believe anyone looking at that process would say it needs to change. It is not merit-based in terms of rank. It is based on suitability and then some political decisions and is not very transparent. We all know that it needs to change. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was described by one of those involved in its creation as a "temporary fix". In 2014 the Association of Judges of Ireland acknowledged that the process was unsatisfactory and needed to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The list of suitable candidates provided by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board for the Cabinet includes only those candidates who are suitable and no ranking is provided for the Cabinet, which obviously leaves the process open to political patronage, something we all want to get rid of. The public, Members of the Oireachtas, the legal profession and the Judiciary all want to see not just suitable lawyers appointed to be judges but also the best, most suitable lawyers, in so far as they would make the best judges. That means that we need to put in place an identifying body that could identify and evaluate the merits of candidates based on their suitability for the post. Critically, such a body needs to be independent and completely free from political considerations at the Cabinet. That is something on which we would all agree. It is reasonable that we have an independent, expert advisory board that could present a list of suitable and ranked candidates, in terms of who the advisory board thinks are the very best candidates, one that would be completely free of the political considerations of the Cabinet. It seems reasonable to want this in the appointment of judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> Of course, the Bill before the House will not achieve this. It does not set out the need to interview candidates, which is extraordinary. I am not aware of any process for appointments to this level of job of this importance under which candidates would not be interviewed. It is astonishing that this would be the case. The proposed candidates will not be ranked and thus the process will not provide guidance on the comparative suitability of the candidates whose names will be put to the Cabinet. Were I a member of the Cabinet and presented with a list of the names of three, five or 20 lawyers and to receive no guidance from an advisory body, I would be at sea in trying to say this lawyer or that lawyer, for the following reasons, appeared to be the strongest candidate. I imagine that certainly some members of the Cabinet, were they to be honest, would say the same and that they would value some detailed guidance from an expert advisory group.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> The Bill also posits the idea that lay people are better placed to make a judgement on the qualities of a prospective judge than judges or lawyers. It is a core element of the mindset of the Bill that people who have never been lawyers or judges are somehow better placed to decide who would make good judges than those in the legal profession or the Judiciary. That seems to be a very peculiar mindset to underpin the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> Critically, of course, the Attorney General who sits at the Cabinet table is a member of the advisory board. I am not making any comment on a specific person who is or has been in the role of Attorney General or will be in the future. However, it is as clear as day that if the Attorney General sits on the advisory board and is the only person sitting at the Cabinet table when the list is discussed, we have a direct link between the advisory board and the Cabinet which will make the decision. By definition, that means that it is no longer independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> The Bill before the House is widely recognised as being a proposal brought forward by the Independent Alliance, in particular the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross. I was very taken by something he said in his statement in the House:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_631">The objective of the Bill primarily is to reduce, if it is not able to eliminate, political interference in the selection of judges. This is the primary aim, and to do it as soon as possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_632">The Minister has a Bill and is stating that its primary aim is to eliminate political interference in the appointment of judges, yet we have a direct link between the advisory board and the Cabinet. In addition, we will have no advice on the best candidates on the list sent to the Cabinet, which leaves the process wide open. For example, one could say, "We have five lawyers in front of us. We do not know what their merits are as we are not lawyers and do not spend our time in court, so we do not know which of them would make the best judge of the District Court or the Circuit Court. However, we know this person because he or she is in Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Sinn Féin and that he or she is a good person, so let us go with what we know. We know that this person is decent, a good lawyer and a person of integrity and think he or she would make a great judge." It is political patronage. If that is the stated intention, self-evidently, the Bill will not achieve it. The list of names put forward will provide no assessment of comparative suitability.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> This is how the process will work under the Bill the Government is putting forward. The applicants' suitability will be examined. There will be no interviews. There will be a lay majority assessing candidates for roles of which they would have very little experience and understanding of the requirements to be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Critically, under the legislation there will be no representation from the District Court, the President of which is excluded from being a member of the advisory board. There will be no representation from the Circuit Court, the President of which is also excluded from being a member of the advisory board. As the Minister knows - I knew even before I started to look into this issue - the majority of judges are appointed to the District Court and the Circuit Court. On the advisory body there will be lay people who will make decisions about judicial appointments to the Circuit Court and the District Court with no representation from the Circuit Court or the District Court, persons who clearly would be well placed to provide an input on the type of man or woman who would make a great judge of the District Court or the Circuit Court. There will be no ranking of candidates and the Attorney General who sits at the Cabinet table will be a member of the advisory board. It seems to be a very peculiar way to achieve the end of removing political interference and ensure we have the best judges. It just does not make sense to me. I am not a lawyer and do not spend a lot of time in court and honestly do not know what the best characteristics of judges are. I would not be able to pick the best candidate from a list of four or 20 lawyers whom I did not know, but I do know enough to know that the process I have outlined is, self-evidently, not the best way for Ireland to select the best judges. Therefore, why are we discussing it? Why is this being brought forward by the Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> The Bill further indicates that the Judiciary is, in some way, compromised, that having a majority of professionals on the board will in some way lead to political decisions. There is no indication that this happens. Furthermore, the introduction of lay people in no way insulates appointments of judges from political viewpoints. It is absolutely reasonable for us to assume that lay people with political viewpoints, be they pro-life, pro-choice, pro or anti-European, would look to get onto the board to try to influence the views of the judges we will have in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> The elements of the Bill we have outlined and which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has gone through in great length simply will not achieve its stated aims, but it does appear that the Fianna Fáil Bill would achieve them. What does the Bill do? We will have a lay majority, but there is no indication why that is necessary. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has asked for an answer to be given on this issue on a number of occasions, but, to the best my knowledge, he still has not received a satisfactory answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> It has been stated - I am sure the Minister is sick of hearing the example given time and again - but for a lay person and a non-lawyer like me, if the Minister for Health was to say we would start appointing doctors and hospital consultants using a majority of non-medical people - that we would get somebody from the local GAA club, the local credit union, the local tidy towns committee, the principal of the local school, an eminent lawyer and an eminent human rights activist - to appoint cardiologists, neurologists and brain surgeons, it would not last 24 hours because we would all get that the head of the credit union was not well placed to appoint cardiologists and we would all understand the local school principal was not well placed to advise on the best junior doctor to become a neurologist. However, because we are dealing with the world of the Judiciary it is complicated. Most members of the public, including me, do not really understand this stuff, but that is essentially what we are suggesting. We are suggesting the head of the credit union, the local school principal, a human rights activist and a local fisherman could appoint a neurologist, that we have a majority of lay people on the board and that we also have three doctors on it. I do not think too many people would feel comfortable in getting sick if that is how we were to start appointing consultants or nurses, or teachers, but that is what we will do in the case of one of the most critical roles in the public service, namely, the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Regardless of whether the Bill is passed, the Constitution still gives ultimate power to the Government to appoint judges. In this case, the logical solution is to ensure it has access to the best possible advice, which means ranking candidates. I heard the Minister's earlier rebuttal, that if the advisory body was to place candidates first, second and third, what would be the point of the Cabinet even meeting to discuss the matter as the first placed candidate would be chosen. I would like to receive expert advice. If I had to make decisions on appointing lawyers to become judges, I would like more than a list. I would like to receive the expert advice of senior judges and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> The Bill before the House makes a mistake that is made far too often, which is that we identify the minimum standard required to be met. The JAAB did this, but it should not have done and the Bill does so. It fails to recognise the failing of this approach, in that it does not identify those who truly excel, the best possible candidates, and, obviously, does not eliminate political interference in the appointment of judges. On the other hand, Fianna Fáil's Bill would achieve these aims. It would allow us to avail of sufficient expertise from the legal profession and the Judiciary. There would be representation from the District Court and the Circuit Court and the Bill would mandate the holding of interviews. It would also provide for rankings and the giving of expert advice to the Cabinet. There would be nobody sitting on the advisory board who was also sitting at the Cabinet table. There would be a mandatory explanation required from the Cabinet if it decided to go with a candidate from outside the list. Obviously, it would still be the Cabinet's right to do so. Fianna Fáil's Bill states this could be done, but an explanation would have to be given.</p>

          <p eId="para_648">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on his new role and wish him the very best of luck in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017. While Fianna Fáil fully believes in the need for reform of the judicial appointments system, we also believe the Bill published by the Government is deeply flawed. Fianna Fáil has proposed legislation to establish a judicial appointments commission, fully independent of the Government, that would make recommendations to the Government based on an independent assessment of the merits of applicants for judicial office. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, who has put immense work into it. He is an expert in the area. As Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly stated, we need expertise in making any appointment but particularly in this profession which is critical for the country. With the proposals for a lay majority and the downgrading of the Chief Justice’s position, the Government has let the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, drive forward a spurious agenda which risks undermining the independence of the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 will change the way judges are appointed in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">A new body, the judicial appointments commission, will replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. Serving judges applying to another judicial position will have to apply through the judicial appointments commission. It is imperative our judicial appointments process is reformed to ensure people are appointed to judicial office based solely on merit. For that reason, Fianna Fáil proposed legislation establishing a judicial appointments commission, fully independent of the Government, which would make recommendations to the Government based on an independent assessment of the merits of applicants for judicial office.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> The commission proposed by the Government will not allow for such an independent process of assessment. That is the most critical and poignant part of this legislation. Among its faults, the Bill will require the Chief Justice to sit on a commission that she will not chair. This is indicative of the disrespect that the Government has for the Judiciary. This Bill will exclude the Presidents of the Circuit and District Courts from full membership of the commission. It is also recommended that the majority of the commission should be lay members, namely, persons who are neither judges nor lawyers. This grouping of judges and lawyers in the same category by the Government ignores the fact that judges are not members of the legal profession. The fact that they were previously members is not a basis to assume that judges and lawyers, if in a majority, will have a negative influence on this commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> The Bill proposes that the three persons recommended by the commission will not be ranked in order of merit. The failure to do so defeats the entire purpose of having a commission that seeks to recommend the best candidate. It is regrettable the proposals put forward by the Government are not for the purpose of achieving genuine reform but, instead, are for the purpose of appeasing one member of the Government whose proposals in this area are ill-considered and deeply flawed.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> Fianna Fáil remains committed to achieving reform in this area, as outlined in its Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, published in October 2016. The weakness in the current system means that when a large list of names is presented to the Cabinet, most of them do not know how to go about choosing one person from a list of 24 for a District Court position. There is no reason politicians should be aware of who is the most suitable or best candidate. It is true people who have political connections are at an advantage if their names are on the list which goes to the Cabinet. Many people who are appointed because of political connections turn out to be excellent judges. We should not have a system whereby because a person is involved in politics, he or she should be excluded from subsequent nomination to judicial office. We need a recommending body which can identify who it believes will be the best person for the position of judge. We should have a recommending body that ranks individuals in terms of their suitability for the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> Under the Constitution, which is appropriate, the Government has the final say. Regardless of what system is in place or how it operates, the Government can disregard the list of candidates provided by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and appoint a candidate of its choosing. This is the system which currently operates under the Constitution. However, we believe it needs to be changed and broadened to ensure it is fairer and that the best people have an opportunity to be considered and appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> The Fianna Fáil Bill establishes a judicial appointments commission to recommend to the Government the names of individuals who it believes would be the most suitable, based on merit, to be judges. For each position, it will recommend three people. The Government scheme has the same provision. Under our Bill, however, the three will be ranked in order of one, two and three. In no way does that offend the constitutional prerogative that rests with the Cabinet. Under neither scheme must the Cabinet opt for anyone on the list. However, there is a benefit in the Cabinet being told by a body with expertise that it believes these are the three best people in a certain order.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> I come from a different professional background in education. In any interview panels on which I sat or was party to, there was always expertise on them. That format has to be followed if we are serious about getting the best people in such critical positions in the Judiciary. One would not put people with no teaching experience or nothing to contribute on a panel interviewing for a teacher, a vice principal or principal post. Needless to say, the same should apply to appointing judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> There is a further important part of the Fianna Fáil Bill which differs from the Government’s. We set out specific criteria if people are to be appointed as judges. It is important the public be apprised of what qualities one needs to be appointed. This provision is not found in the Government’s scheme. It is important we set out in our legislation matters that may seem obvious. One needs integrity, independence of mind, moral courage, a high level of intellectual skill, sound temperament, common sense, impartiality, objectivity, fairness and composure. The greatest judge in the world will not have all these. However, it is useful for the public to know what is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> A further way in which Fianna Fáil’s Bill is relevant concerns the membership of the commission. The body of people most qualified to make recommendations are judges themselves and others who have experience. Under our Bill, there would be 12 members on the commission. These include the Chief Justice who is President of the Supreme Court and the Presidents of the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court. They would be judicial members. Interestingly, the Government has adopted hook, line and sinker the language of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, which is all about lay people and non-lay people. It is offensive to judges that non-lay people, under the Government’s scheme, are described as judges and lawyers. Judges are not practising lawyers. They were lawyers formerly. The membership of the commission proposed and advocated by Fianna Fáil is of persons who have the best interests of the people at heart when it comes to identifying individuals who would make good judges. It is farcical to suggest that judges, such as presidents of the courts, will want to select for recommendation people who are their friends. They will want to ensure the people chosen are effective and useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> The Association of Judges of Ireland issued a statement to express its concerns at several measures contained in the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. The Judiciary is not opposed to the introduction of changes in the system of appointments to the Bench. However, it believes, as does Fianna Fáil, the proposals going before the Oireachtas are seriously flawed. These concerns need to be listened to. Reform of how judges are appointed will have significant consequences for this country that will impact long after the current Government is gone. Unfortunately, this Bill is misguided and poorly constructed. Fianna Fáil remains committed to achieving reform in this area, as outlined in our Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. Again, I compliment our justice spokesperson, Deputy Jim O’Callaghan, who has put immense work into it.

          <p eId="para_661">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on his new appointment. I know that he will do a good job as he was junior spokesperson in the justice position several years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> I congratulate our justice spokesperson, Deputy Jim O’Callaghan, on bringing forward his legislation which also proposes the establishment of a judicial appointments commission. The Government’s Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 will change the way judges are appointed. A new body, the judicial appointments commission, will replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, originally established under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995. Serving judges applying to another judicial position will have to apply through the judicial appointments commission. It will be made up of 13 members with a lay majority and lay chair. It will be responsible for recommending a maximum of three candidates per judicial vacancy to the Minister for Justice and Equality. It will replace the current system where between seven to 20 names are submitted to the Minister. The Bill provides that certain legal academics who have professional legal qualifications will be eligible to apply for judicial office. The Bill establishes in law that judicial appointments will be based on merit. An obligation to review the judicial appointments commission is included in the Bill. The Bill’s operation must be reviewed by the judicial procedure committee of the judicial appointments commission and the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">I welcome the opportunity to address this important debate in the House. Fianna Fáil's motivation for the presentation of this motion is to ensure hard-pressed home owners will not be gouged by a free-for-all pricing arrangement by unscrupulous waste collectors. We are deeply concerned over the potential for this practice to continue and believe the only fair and safe method of ensuring this price-gouging does not happen is through the introduction of a regulator. They say history repeats itself but I did not know it would do so in such a short timeframe until the Minister, Deputy Naughten, announced his plans to change how waste collection charges are determined. His plan to introduce a new weight or lift-based system without any information on how these structural changes will affect prices for consumers bore more than a passing resemblance to the plan of his Cabinet colleague, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, last year. Therefore, consumers unfortunately find themselves exactly the same situation as last year, which is completely open and exposed to the whims of the most unscrupulous waste collection operators in the marketplace today.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> Last year, Fianna Fáil called on the former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, to suspend the new charges regime until we established why families were experiencing a massive increase in their bills. In addressing this, he promised a public awareness campaign, which did not transpire, unfortunately, and the introduction of dual pricing so people could compare the cost of a pay-by-weight arrangement relative to a fixed-charge system, which also did not transpire, unfortunately. Therefore, it is very clear that in the intervening 12-month period, nothing by way of an effort to convince the public of the necessity to go away from the flat fee has taken place. This year, we will again challenge the Government not to make false promises. We are calling for the establishment of an independent waste regulator, which will establish the true costs of waste collection and management and ensure that consumer prices directly reflect these. This regulator will make it easier for consumers to shop around and compare their options, and prevent price gouging. In other words, it is to give certainty to the consumer that he or she is getting value for money from the operator in his or her area, whether there is a competitive environment or a single operator.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> Unlike proposals put forth by certain other parties present, Fianna Fáil's motion does not endanger the environmental underpinnings of this new weight-based collection system. We recognise and support the need for Ireland to reduce the amount of waste it produces, and particularly to reduce the amount of waste that we send to landfill. I know of no community that wants another landfill in its area. Doing what we propose will require a multi-pronged approach. In the first instance, we must ensure that landfill is the last resort for everyone involved. Under the landfill directive, Ireland has been directed to divert biodegradable waste, such as food waste, timber or garden waste, away from landfill. I am happy to say that while in government, Fianna Fáil successfully ensured that Ireland's first target under this directive was met.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Under the waste directive, we have to achieve reuse and recycling targets of 50% by weight of household waste derived from paper, metal, plastic and glass by 2020. This includes metal and plastic estimates from household WEEE. As Ireland's landfills rapidly approach maximum capacity, we now have to increase the amount of biodegradable waste that we divert.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> Our conversation cannot end at better management of waste, however. Even when material is recycled, its initial production, transportation and disposal have a huge impact on the earth's resources. It is totally unacceptable, and I do not need to remind my fellow Deputies of the immense humanitarian, environmental, and societal costs that await us if we do not change our ways on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> For these reasons, Fianna Fáil believes we need to get serious, as a society, about waste reduction. Consumers, by and large, have no control over how much packaging their groceries, household items or consumer goods come in. All of us have had the experience of buying a tiny electronic device that comes in a box ten times its size, or of buying a piece of fruit that is wrapped in layers of plastic. Why should the consumer, or the environment for that matter, pay the price for the disposal of this material? We need to encourage and support innovative measures to cut down on unnecessary packaging, and for this reason we support the establishment of a waste-reduction task force to identify opportunities to reduce waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> Also related to waste disposal is the regrettable phenomenon of illegal dumping and fly-tipping. Too many communities around the country are totally blighted by mounds of waste that have been unscrupulously emptied onto green spaces on housing estates, back roads, riverways, and other community assets. Sadly, illegal dumping is often most likely to occur in remote scenic areas, such as viewing points, forests and nature hotspots. It is a visual blight on the landscape, places an undue burden on communities and has dire impacts on the ecosystem. We believe the Government must devote more resources to analysing and addressing the underlying causes of illegal dumping, in addition to taking progressive steps to crack down on those responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> All this aside, we must ensure we do not shift the cost of waste from the environment onto the consumer. To do so would be unfair and counterproductive to our long-term goal of building an environmentally responsible nation. To return to my earlier point, this is where a regulator comes in. The regulator does not need to be a bulky operation to work well. It must have teeth, but its remit is, by definition, narrow in focus. The Environmental Protection Agency already does a good job in ensuring that all waste collection operators meet our environmental standards in terms of how they handle the waste that they collect. Simply put, it must have the ability to monitor the true costs of providing a waste-collection service and prevent any egregious price increases by companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> The regulator must be established as quickly as possible, although I accept it will take time to establish it. If this does not happen, unscrupulous operators can simply swoop in and hike up their prices before the regulator is even established. The Government's proposal today on the establishment of a watchdog can be seen as an interim measure, but will be acceptable to us only if it ensures that an appropriate regulator is put in place at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> We are not opposed to working with other parties to ensure that reasonable politics wins out for the sake of the consumer. Compromise is possible provided that it protects and supports the consumer. To this end, I come to the Government's motion, which establishes a regulator. This is a considerable shift from its original position, which saw it use every excuse under the sun as to why a regulator could not be established. Instead, it is now committed to introducing a regulator, with the watchdog as a temporary measure to prevent proactive price increases while it is being established.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Furthermore, in response to our motion, the Government has backtracked on its initial proposal to provide assistance only to those people with long-term medical incontinence needs. The Government is also now committed to providing support to families experiencing genuine hardship, a much-needed recognition of the impacts that altered prices may have on households, such as low-income families or those with many young children who simply cannot cut down on the amount they put into their black bins. This is a much-needed and more humane policy, and one for which Fianna Fáil takes some responsibility of ensuring that the Government has included.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> In short, we believe that while we have not yet reached where we need to go, we have made considerable progress. Rather than allowing a vicious free-for-all to unfold, in which waste collection charges are hiked up without any reason or rhyme, Fianna Fáil has today ensured that waste collection operators must operate in a manner that is fair to the consumer and to the environment. I reiterate that our only objective in putting this motion before the House is to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and equitably, that they get value for money for the service provided and that a regulator is put in place to ensure that unscrupulous waste collectors cannot gouge home owners out of their hard-pressed earnings.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Curran<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_702">This time last year, the Minister's predecessor tried to introduce a pay-by-weight scheme. The problems that arose from that saw an agreement with the waste collection industry to have a price freeze and afford an opportunity for a new pricing and management structure to be implemented. I have asked the Minister questions regularly over the course of the year because it is an area about which I have had considerable concern. This day last week, while I was asking him questions, the Minister used the opportunity to outline his new proposal, which is the abolition of the all-in flat rate over time. I fully understand why he is doing it. There are the issues of recycling, reuse and so forth. There are also the issues that have been referred to, such as dumping and all of that. However, the concern I had at that point was that we had not dealt with the core issue that we saw last year. When the pay-by-weight regime was being introduced, we saw particular price increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The Taoiseach spoke today about a watchdog and about how 50% of people are already paying for multiple bins, tags and so forth. Last year, it was people who had green bins, black bins and brown bins who also saw the price increase. My view and my concern is this that we do not have a functioning and competitive market. In the absence of that, we need a regulator. What convinces me of that are the potential price increases that were published last year, when individual families could compare what they would be paying going forward versus what they paid last year. The increases were not minor. They were significant. Many households were looking at double bills. I am convinced that that competitive market does not exist. The only way that we can have a fair and transparent system is through the establishment and appointment of a regulator. In the interim, during the establishment period, it is also important to continue and extend the agreement of the price freeze with the industry to afford the Minister the opportunity to establish a regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> I will conclude on this point. I come from an ordinary suburb of Dublin. I have pizza delivery guys, Sky and Eir all competing for business. Not one other refuse collection company canvasses looking for my business. It is not a competitive market. In the absence of that, I urge the Minister to bite the bullet on this and establish a regulator to control those prices as soon as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankORourke" eId="spk_350">
          <from>Deputy Frank O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_705">I take this opportunity to support my colleague, Deputy Timmy Dooley, and the Private Members' motion he has tabled. All proposed bin charges need to be suspended until appropriate measures are put in place to ensure that this is comprehensively dealt with in a robust manner. In our view, it is important to have an independent regulator's office in place to adjudicate on whether such increases are necessary at all and, if so, what they should be. Currently, where there is an industry that is self-regulating, it is not fair and is completely unacceptable to the public. In the past, we have seen the private sector being opportune and putting forward unacceptable increases to the public, who were already stretched to limits beyond acceptability through the day-to-day running of their lives and the other Bills that come into play on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> No increase is fair here because people are paying enough already. We only need to look at the increases currently being paid by people for motor insurance, which is out of control, and variable interest rates on mortgages, which are way higher than our colleagues in other European countries. We are now looking at an increase in bin charges. We talk about having modest decreases in the USC. However, the modest decrease in the USC, which we all want to see coming into people's pockets to give them the power of spending in the local economies, is already absorbed and consumed by the inflated increases in the areas we have spoken about.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> It is very important that an independent regulator is appointed in this area to adjudicate on the current self-regulatory practice that is completely unacceptable. It is negatively impacting on the public with massively increased charges that cannot be condoned into the future. The Government's proposal on this initiative is that the polluter pays. That is not correct in this case. When these increases were spoken about last year, we saw that the actual people who were separating their waste and doing everything properly and in a good manner were seeing their standing charge increase by 100%. That is not acceptable. What was their reward for being compliant? The reward was getting a 100% increase. That comes back to self-regulation, which is no longer acceptable. The €75 grant that was spoken about being offered is completely at odds with this and is unacceptable. It does not meet with the requirements of people who are caring for someone elderly at home or people with young families.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> The other problem we have is fly-tipping and the people who burn waste in their own back gardens at the weekend or in the evening. Local authorities are no longer resourced to deal with that, as the Minister knows. This will only get worse in the time ahead if it is allowed to be pressed on with. I ask the Minister to look at this motion, put charges on hold and establish an independent office to see if increases are necessary and, if so, what they should be.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesLawless" eId="spk_351">
          <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_709">I commend Deputy Dooley as our spokesperson on this area on tabling this motion on this vital matter. As I am sure is the case with all parties in the House, Fianna Fáil is fully paid up to the polluter pays principle and is very cognisant of our obligations both moral and legal in making sure that it is indeed the polluter who pays. We are fully aware of the targets that we signed up to as a country, as well as the moral obligation on all of us to support them. However, the experience has differed from that. There has been an exploitation of users. The opportunity was taken by commercial operators to increase charges when it presented in the past. That kind of charging, overcharging and complication of the marketplace has unfortunately been a feature that we saw in evidence just 12 months ago. It is regrettable that the past year has gone by and we are having this debate again. It does not appear as if the ground has shifted very much in terms of an education policy, an outreach programme or a public information programme that we might have expected in the meantime to try to engage with those operators and with the public in order to avoid <i>déjà vu</i> 12 months on. I believe the date is now set for 1 September. It continues to slide out.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> This morning, the offices of some insurance companies were raided. I think there was cartel-type behaviour being discussed and suspected. While I would hesitate to allege that anybody in the waste industry participates in such practices, we do know that there are some colourful operators within the waste industry. There are rag-and-bone men and many of them have various different patterns of behaviour. One of the items in the motion seeks to increase the resources of local authorities. Unfortunately, the environment section is often the least resourced section of every local authority. That is in terms of fly-tipping, as my colleagues have spoken about, right up to the high-end commercial operators and enforcement. If a landfill operator decides to break the rules and throw an extra load in at midnight or even in plain daylight, it is often very difficult to go after the operator because the authorities lack the resources that are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> The idea of a regulator is eminently sensible. It is needed. The more fragmentation and complication of the marketplace and the greater plethora of offerings, the more likely it is for there to be customer confusion, obfuscation and people getting duped by operators. While it seems sensible on one level to operate per lift or per kilo with flat charges of different offerings, it has been seen in other markets, such as in utilities, health insurance and banking, that switching does not really happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Inertia comes into the system. The more complicated that system becomes, the more difficult it is for the consumer to navigate and, ultimately and unfortunately, the supplier wins out because they are the ones that benefit from that inertia. Regulators have worked well in other markets. The Health Insurance Authority regulates the health insurance market. There is less regulation in banking but, belatedly, a switching market is now in place. This would lend itself very well to this kind of complex offering in the waste market.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Scanlon<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_713">I compliment Deputy Dooley on tabling this Private Members' motion. It is very important. Last year, we called on the Minister to implement a transition period for the new system to ensure that households were fully informed and could financially plan around their expected charges. It is fair to say that they were more informed last year than they are this year. It is crucial that people are properly informed about what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> My main concern is that indiscriminate dumping could increase. While I am on my feet, I also wish to compliment the environment section of Sligo County Council which applied for and received funding to clean up a rural road in County Sligo that was a lovely walkway used by many people but where there had been indiscriminate dumping. I went to see it myself and it was disgraceful. The local community got together, went to Sligo County Council and applied for funding. It will take two to three skips to get rid of the stuff that is there and a Hymac to take it out of the ground. I urge the Minister to ensure the funding is there for that type of work in which the community is involved and where it is prepared to go down, do the work itself and help the local authority to clean up areas. The follow up is crucial as well such as cameras to detect people who are indiscriminately dumping across the countryside. We have four bad cases in County Sligo and those four areas will be funded this year. It is crucial that we do everything to support the local authorities to deal with this issue because what is happening is disgraceful. </p>
          <p eId="para_715"> As far as I can see, there is one collector in my area of Ballymote in Sligo. There are supposed to be two but there is only one. My household, which contains two people, pays €360 per year. That is the set charge. People are very concerned that this could change. For many people, it is a lot of money to find but they are doing it. We do not have a brown bin either. There is no competition whatsoever in our area. I cannot speak about other areas. I can only speak about my own area. There must be protection for everybody but particularly for areas where there is no opposition and there is only one operator. It is important that this regulator has some authority to deal with people and that people have some place to go when issues arise and where they feel they are being overcharged.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">We live in an era where "fake news" can often inform public debate as much as reality and hard facts. There is an onus on all of us who are serious about how we deal with waste to ensure that the public debate is founded on hard facts and reality. One of those realities is that we must act now to prevent a return to an over-dependence on landfill. As a Minister and Deputy, it would be inexcusable for me to do nothing and to allow a situation to develop whereby household bins go uncollected on our streets because there is nowhere to bring waste. That is what motivates these proposals and that is why I have listened carefully to those who want to contribute constructively to that debate. I am looking to implement Deputy Curran's proposals from last week on customer information and Senator Ardagh's proposals from last month on litter fines. </p>
          <p eId="para_750"> For this reason and to acknowledge the concerns of some households, I will establish a pricing watchdog monitoring unit that will provide monthly reports on pricing developments and I will ask the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, to report on the operation of the household waste collection market. This will inform the future development of national waste management policy before year end, which will provide an evidence base to establish a regulator to prevent price gouging. This unit will comprise representatives from the CCPC, my Department, a consumer representative from an organisation such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and an external economic expert with market knowledge. </p>
          <p eId="para_751"> I have been saying clearly for some time that I am not introducing a mandatory pay-per-kilo model. Such a model is too restrictive and would not be the most appropriate model for certain household profiles. Indeed, I have expressed my own concerns regarding those with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence. Over half of households currently on a kerb side waste collection are already on an incentivised pricing option and are happy to continue with this model. In fact, and this is a point that has not been sufficiently emphasised, there will be no change in the situation of those people as a result of the measures I am introducing with the exception of those using medical incontinence wear who will get an additional €75 discount per person. </p>
          <p eId="para_752"> Over the past 12 months, my Department and I have engaged with a wide variety of different stakeholders. As a result, the Government made a decision last week on the future of the household waste collection market. As I stated at the outset, there is insufficient capacity to deal with household waste unless we make some changes and either we change the amount of waste being presented by householders or we build additional facilities to deal with the waste. The choice facing us is stark. We have moved in this country from having a landfill in each local authority area to having only four landfills currently accepting household municipal waste. None of us wishes to revert to the situation we had previously and so difficult decisions are necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> Flat rate fees are not a good option to encourage behaviour change as it does not matter how often the household presents bins and it also does not matter how much waste is in the bin presented. This is why flat rate fees are being phased out over the next 15 months. The second change facilitated under last week's announcement is the roll-out of the organic, or brown, bin to households in communities of greater than 500 people. I am sure Ballymote will fall into this category. This will encourage households to minimise the amount of waste they generate and segregate the remaining waste. This is to ensure that the minimum waste possible is presented in the residual, or black, bin. The final change is to provide a Government support of €75 per year to assist persons with medical incontinence. This is based on the average cost of disposal of 650 kilograms of incontinence products and was developed in consultation with industry and patient stakeholder groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> It is important to point out that emergency measures were needed twice last year to deal with the capacity crisis that took place. If emergency measures had not been taken, it would not have been possible to have people's bins collected. This is an ongoing issue. We need to deal with the problem or we will be in a situation where by 2020, we will have no facilities available to deal with two months of waste collection. Surely nobody wants to see bins left uncollected for the months of July and August. Rhetoric and grandstanding will not change this, and decisions are required. We are also facing challenging EU targets and we need to incentivise households to do the right thing and to reduce the amount of residual waste we generate. Failure to meet an existing or future target leaves the State open to infringement proceedings and potentially punitive fines. </p>
          <p eId="para_755"> The changes the Government is making to the proposed mandatory per kilo charging system mean that there is the potential for more competition in the market. Rather than only being able to offer a per kilo rate, companies can now offer a range of incentivised pricing options. Examples of these include a per kilo charge, a lift fee and per kilo charge, weight band charging or a weight allowance plus per kilo surcharge for excess weights.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> Labour Deputies have proposed that the EPA should replace local authorities and run competitions for waste collection. However, when Deputy Kelly was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, he did not introduce competition for the market and he did not agree with the introduction of a regulator as he launched pay-by-weight in 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The EPA is an environmental regulator and, therefore, it has no expertise in economic or pricing regulation. It would not be advisable to divert the EPA from its primary goal of improving Ireland’s environment. People Before Profit Deputies want to turn back time and remunicipalise waste collection and abolish all charges. However, it is clearly unrealistic to manage waste for free. Who will pay for those services? If remunicipalised waste is to be environmentally sustainable, why should a good recycler pay the same as someone who makes no effort to reduce waste?</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> Sinn Féin claims that this new arrangement unfairly impacts on vulnerable customers. Half of households are already using the new arrangements. However, we are providing a support for incontinence products that is based on the weight of these products to every family throughout the country. We are rolling out more organic and food bins so that families can divert more waste from landfill. It is important to point out that every year, on average, a typical family in Ireland throws away €700 worth of food, the majority of which is going into the black bin. There is a significant opportunity for people to change that practice. Families can choose a lift charge option that gives them certainty on cost if they put their bin out once per month and there is nothing in the new arrangement that would prevent a local authority from implementing a waiver scheme in its area.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> The changes I have announced will allow for far greater competition than the option for a single pricing plan, which would have restricted competitors and what they could offer. What I have announced means no change for half of households in the market using a kerbside collector and, for the other half, the operators can offer a variety of plans as long as they incentivise waste reduction and segregation. If a company is not offering what the market wants, it is open to a competitor to offer a different plan which meets market demand. Open competition and pricing options drive prices down.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> The basic message to households is to think about the waste they produce. When price plans are offered to less than half of the market not currently on an incentivised plan from autumn this year to autumn next year, it will make some demands on households. To control waste costs, it will be necessary for households to minimise the waste they generate and segregate the remaining waste properly. We have to make changes and it is only right that we move to a situation where people produce less waste and throw away less. Unless people want to see the re-emergence of landfills in every local authority area, we need, collectively, to make the transition from taking little notice of what goes into the black bin to being conscious of what we are dumping.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> What we are doing is most certainly not about imposing financial hardship on families - far from it. Nobody leaves lights and the immersion on anymore when there is an incentive to turn them off. This is a similar behavioural change that we need to introduce in the waste area. We in Ireland were the first to introduce behavioural changes in relation to plastic bags and it worked. Using our bins properly will not only make a difference to our waste costs, but it will also make an enormous difference to our environment and our future. I look forward to hearing the constructive suggestions coming from the Deputies and I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_762">I am sharing time with Deputies Maurice Quinlivan, Carol Nolan and Imelda Munster.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> What is happening with this proposal is that waste is being turned into a commodity, and it has the potential to increase prices massively. The purpose of our amendment is to immediately block these proposed changes. Fianna Fáil has chosen not to stop the new charges and changes, but to set up another quango to oversee them. Our amendment stops the potential for runaway prices, puts in place a waiver scheme for low income households and people with medical need, puts an obligation on manufacturers and big businesses to reduce the volumes of waste they produce, and ensures that local authorities have the powers and resources to deal with illegal dumping.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> We understand the objective of regulation and the requirement for it but we have structures and we do not need another quango. The EPA and the Department are there. I heard what the Minister said, but the EPA has a role in this and that can be put in place with regard to oversight and enforcement powers. People must have an efficient waste collection service which includes segregation and recycling. It is dreadfully neglected with regard to oversight for such a basic public service. Regulation is needed because this was an industry privatised and allowed free rein under past Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments. Now Fianna Fáil wants to create a pretence of difference between itself and Fine Gael, but it is just letting the Government off the hook with its amendment. It is strong in language but has little substance. Arguments made by conservative politicians that the service was privatised because of campaigns against bin charges do not stand up. In County Laois, the service was privatised just over 30 years ago, in 1987, when there was absolutely no campaign against bin charges. Even the landfill site at Kyletalisha just outside Portlaoise is now under private control. The result of all this is that people across the county pay increasing charges despite the fact that there are numerous collectors. There are situations, as outlined earlier on, in rural areas, where there may only be one collector, so the competition argument does not stack up.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> The lack of control in waste collection in this country is a great example of <i>laissez-faire</i> economics. With 67 separate collectors, it is a free-for-all and the Government proposal has the potential to make this worse. Alongside regulation, we must also examine the possibility of taking back control, under local authorities, of the waste collection system, and that needs to be pursued. These things are ruled out, but other EU states do this very effectively. The Taoiseach said today that this new system "incentivises people to throw less away", but excessive packaging is still being churned out by the tonne by producers and by big business, and it is commodifying waste because people have to pay for this, and that will continue to be the case, and that puts a demand on landfill. </p>
          <p eId="para_766"> The Government has a choice here, but the one it is taking is the one towards the end of the conveyor belt, not the producer. It is about cost on the householder and not putting the penalty and restrictions on big business and manufacturers. Some manufacturers, as the Minister knows, have taken a responsible attitude towards this and massively reduced the volumes of waste produced, and increased recycling and reuse rates. Repak and others in the industry can talk all about that, but very significant progress is being made and we need to accelerate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> The polluter pays principle in the EU waste directive states that “the costs of waste management shall be borne by the original waste producer or by the current or previous waste holders”. It goes on to state that “Member States may decide that the costs of waste management are to be borne partly or wholly by the producer of the product from which the waste came and that the distributors of such product may share these costs”. That is what it says, but what has happened here is that it has been placed on the householders who already have skyrocketing costs with car insurance, home insurance, family home tax, mortgages and spiralling rents which are out of control as well. I believe the Government is portraying an awful image of the ordinary person as being wasteful with no concern for the environment. This is completely wrong. We are in fact one of the top recyclers in Europe now. We are actually in fourth place and on target to meet our requirements for household waste recycling for 2020. We are currently, according to figures from the Minister's Department, at 45% with an objective to reach 50%. We fully support that and want to drive that on as fast as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> There is no initiative here for waste reduction, which should be the key to waste policy. The average citizen now pays many times for waste and for products. Once he or she has purchased the item and all the lovely waste that it is wrapped in, we heavily subsidise the waste industry to dispose of this, in particular incineration. Along with not addressing waste reduction, the burden is placed on the householder. We ask the Minister to put in place a waiver system for low income householders. The proposal of €75 per year for those with medical incontinence is inadequate. It is possible to have a waiver scheme; Limerick County Council has one at the moment. The last Government - which the Minister was not in, but Fine Gael and the Labour Party were - promised one, but it never happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> The Minister needs to immediately withdraw the proposed changes on pricing, put in place a proper waiver scheme, conduct a feasibility study on bringing back the service under local authority control and give sufficient powers to local authorities to stop illegal dumping. My party's amendment does exactly that and we urge Members to support it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maurice Quinlivan<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_770">This move by the Government highlights how out of touch it is. As usual, Fianna Fáil is waiting in the wings to support its partners in government no matter what.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> Fianna Fáil's motion does not block these new charges, but simply lets the Government off the hook. It amazes me that the Government has no hesitation in introducing measures that will result in increased bills for hard-pressed families but at the same time refuses to even consider increasing the minimum wage or tackling the spiralling cost of living for the same people. Did the Government consider people's ability to pay when it came up with this idea? Did it consider those who produced more rubbish due to their age, infirmity, family size or personal circumstances? I doubt it.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> We have heard that the aim of this measure is to reduce the amount of waste. Financially penalising people will not achieve this. In fact, it will probably make the problem worse. Pay-by-weight or by lift will more than likely increase the level of illegal dumping — simply transferring the problem of waste in our landfills to illegally dumped rubbish in our lanes, countryside and bogs. This will have a heavy environmental and financial impact. I have seen this in my own city of Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> Why not tackle companies using excess plastic packaging in their products? Why not introduce effective measures to tackle illegal dumping? Why not introduce a bottle return scheme or something similar? Why not think of innovative solutions? The Government's solution to most issues is to simply get citizens to pay more and hope for the best. It did not work with the water charges and it will not work for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Taking away refuse collection from local authorities was a huge mistake. In Limerick, waste collection is now a mess. When it was privatised by the then Labour Party Mayor, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, a bin waiver was devised for some of the poorest and most vulnerable citizens across the city. The scheme still exists but has been gutted by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on Limerick council over the years. No doubt the same will happen with the Government's pathetic €75 grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> The large number of waste companies does not result in good competition and low prices, but it means bins on every street almost every day of the week and bin lorries operating and making noise at all hours of the night with multiple operators on different days, often in the same small areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> I am very much in favour of reducing the amount of rubbish we produce in Ireland but these punitive charges will not address the issue. They will increase illegal dumping and will create greater financial uncertainty. I urge the Minister to look at these proposals again.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CarolNolan" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_777">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle as ucht an deis chun labhairt ar an topaic fíor-thábhachtach seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> Sinn Féin initially opposed the introduction of bin charges by the then Fianna Fáil Government. We foresaw that the privatisation of waste collection would result in increases in prices for ordinary families and we were right. Fianna Fáil could not be trusted then and it certainly cannot be trusted now, on this issue or on many, many more.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Citizens are being hit with the prospect of yet another steep rise in an essential household bill - a basic necessity. There are no meaningful waiver or alleviation measures within the new charging scheme to provide relief for low-income households which will find it difficult to meet the increased charges. The provision of an annual sum of €75 for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence is little more than an insult and woefully inadequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> These proposed changes give too much leeway to private companies and less to the consumer. Waste collection, in general, is poorly regulated and we have seen the rise in illegal dumping in recent years. Clearly, Government policy in this area has failed miserably.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> Sinn Féin believes that these proposals should be scrapped. They do nothing for the environment. This system does nothing to reduce the amount of waste being produced in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> We need to look at taking waste collection back into public ownership, introducing policies to reduce packaging and providing waiver schemes to low-income households so that costs do not become a barrier to responsible waste management. This would be a much better and fairer way forward and I call on all Deputies to support our amendment to the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_783">This motion, and the announcement made by Government last week that these charges are to be introduced, have made it clear that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Independents in government are in favour of increased charges for waste collection.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> Fianna Fáil has tabled this motion, not seeking to block the new charges but simply to regulate them. Additional red tape will not solve this problem. This motion is pointless. It says absolutely nothing. In fact, it gives the Government free rein to plough ahead with this. It is ordinary people who will suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> This is no surprise. It was Fianna Fáil which introduced the privatisation of the waste collection services. At the time, Sinn Féin warned about the financial hardship that would face people down the tracks, with huge increases in charges. This has come to pass. This is the latest example of increased charges, that will only continue to increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> It is absolutely shocking that the new charges, and Fianna Fáil's motion, do not make exemptions for low earners. People living in poverty will not be able to afford these charges. The Government and Fianna Fáil might think that the hard times are over, but people across the State continue to be hard pressed to pay for all the additional taxes and charges that have been loaded on them throughout the recession by previous Fianna FáiI and Fine Gael Governments. People are already burdened with PAYE, PRSI, universal social charge, accident and emergency charges, prescription charges, local property tax, motor tax and bin charges, and now these bin charges are set to increase. It is an insult to allow €75 a year for families which will have additional waste for medical reasons. It is €1.50 a week. Is that the best the Minister could do?</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> There is no reward for recycling or composting. Increased recycling or composting food waste will mean that the waste or rubbish bin has less in it and the charge for all bins will increase to compensate for this. To claim otherwise is attempting to fool people. Everybody knows that is precisely what these waste companies will do. There is also no maximum limit for the standing charge allowing it to increase at the companies' will, even for households that rarely put a bin out for collection.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> Sinn Féin's motion is seeking to block the introduction of the pay-by-weight charges. Fianna Fáil's motion falls well short of that. We are also seeking waivers for low-income families. Fianna Fáil's motion falls way short of that also. We are also seeking waivers for families who are already living in poverty. Fianna Fáil's motion also does not address that. We are in favour of waivers for those with disabilities which can lead to additional waste costs. We would also like to see waste collection under local authority control to avoid spiralling costs and lack of accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> Fianna Fáil's motion is pointless. There is nothing in it. It does nothing to address the issues that I have raised. It is only a sop to the Government. It is a pretend motion and is nothing more than one would expect from Fianna Fáil.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_358">
          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_790">I was hoping for some positive message on the regulation of the sector in the Minister's speech and I have to say in all sincerity that I am not seeing anything that is worthwhile. The Minister states that he is acknowledging the concerns of some households and in that regard he will introduce a pricing watchdog monitoring unit. I have never heard of a "pricing watchdog monitoring unit" that will have teeth. This is without teeth. It is, in all honesty, an attempt to placate the Members on the opposite side of the House in order to ensure that this new regime will get as smooth a political passage as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> The monthly reports on pricing developments involving the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to report on the household waste collection market is wholly inadequate. In fairness, the Minister has been <i>in situ</i> for a year. This was announced well over a year ago. What was the Minister doing for the last year on objectively examining how the market for waste operates in Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The idea that the Minister will set up or establish a regulator on the basis of an evidence base or information that is going to come in does not stand up. We are now into July 2017. This is an attempt to kick the can further down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> I am making the argument, notwithstanding the Minister's rejection of our proposal, to give more power to the Environmental Protection Agency and to set up a pricing division in the agency as such measures would ensure the State has a role in the regulation of the market. There would be no major cost impediment to do that. The Minister would have goodwill towards the idea if the EPA was already regulating the market, that is, if legislation was in place to back that up and if the EPA was already researching and analysing the market. The very act of setting up some sort of watchdog or monitoring unit is pointless. There was an opportunity in the past year to set up something that had real teeth and that could have really looked at the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> I do not accept that it is adequate for the Minister to say we are providing choice in the market in respect of the pricing mechanisms, that is, the per kilo charge, the lift and per kilo charge, the weight band charges or the weight allowance plus per kilo surcharge for excess weight. All these different products are already in existence in the market. If we are making the argument on the basis of increased competition, then we have to analyse properly the exact nature of the market at the moment. It is not a perfectly competitive market in spite of the Minister's contention. In fact, the Minister has potentially created a vacuum within a short space of time whereby the waste management companies can come together, act like a cartel and start fixing prices in a manner that they so choose, thereby adversely affecting consumers, in the absence of any proper regulatory regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> People want honesty in the debate. If one considers the polluter pays principle, one cannot have a situation whereby those who recycle every week to the tune of 30%, 40%, 50% or higher of their waste are subsidising those who do not. We need proper analysis of how the market actually works before we introduce any move away from the flat charge structure. There is still a lack of information and of consumer information in particular with regard to what products are available. Most people are price takers because depending on geography, they have no choice but to be price takers. If they live in large conurbations, they may have competition. However, if a person lives in rural west Cork and there is only one operator there, that person is subjected to the pricing mechanism. Let us not call that competition, because it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> We believe there could be a role for the local authorities in future. In the past, local authorities guaranteed universal service but that universal service is no longer in existence. As some people do not have access to waste collection, there is apartheid in that sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> The new structure the Minister proposed to introduce will encourage more people to dispose of their waste illegally. It is not good enough for the Minister to come back to the House after a year with this temporary quick-fix solution. There should have been proper analysis during the past year. We will stand with our hands up if the Minister wants to critique our position – that is fair enough. However, in politics one is also allowed to evolve and advance one's position and the Minister has been <i>in situ</i> for over a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> We have to look at the green schools programme. We all agree with the Repak recycle and change for the better educational programme. All such programmes are having a positive effect on behaviour. However, it is no good teaching a child of seven, eight or ten years of age about the need to recycle if the family of the child does not have the bins at home to be able to do so. That is the current position in large swathes of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> There should be a postponement in this regard. There is a role for the EPA and we need to look at Repak because while there may be an industry view on what Repak does, I do not believe there is a consumer-facing view on what Repak does. We are reaching dangerous levels of plastics production globally. The amount of plastic going into refuse and not being recycled is dangerous at this stage and is resulting in major environmental cost. There is no need to rehash the evidence on what is happening in the environment <i>vis-à-vis</i> the production of plastics. We need an overview and proper analysis of what exactly is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> I reiterate the point that a watchdog monitoring unit is not a sufficient response. We have been in government. I understand that the Government has to respond politically and try to get the motion over the line and so on. There is a confidence and supply arrangement and one should be realistic about that. However, this should not be at the expense of the consumers, who are not fools.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> As for parts of the Minister's speech, for him to stand up in the Dáil and state no one leaves lights or the immersion on any more when there is an incentive to turn them off is schoolboy stuff. It is unbecoming of the Minister to come in and make statements like that. The people are educated and are not to be treated like fools. The people want a market and want to be able to recycle. They want access to proper services. However, the regime the Minister is proposing is not going to provide this because it is not a perfectly competitive market. It is actually going to be more of the same. The people who have the flat charge at the moment are concerned about how much their charges are going to increase as a result of this. They need certainty. People need certainty in their household budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_802">Joe Cooney, a retired city council worker from Ballyfermot, left his bin out this morning and it remains uncollected this evening. Mr. Cooney is not on a gold-plated pension, despite the common perception of public sector workers. On 29 June, he checked his account with Greyhound. He had €21 in credit. Today, when he telephoned Greyhound to see why his bin remained uncollected, he was told that he was short €19. Let us do the arithmetic: that is a difference of €40. When he asked why, he was told that it was because the company had brought in pay-by-weight since the beginning of June and he did not have enough money in his account to meet the weight of the collection today. As a result, the company has left his bin uncollected.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> When Mr. Cooney rang the Minister's office, he was told that someone would get back to him. Someone got back to him and said that the companies had introduced pay-by-weight. The Minister said in a statement last week that there is nothing he can do about these companies and their behaviour. I am unsure whether that was a slip of the tongue, whether I am misquoting the Minister or whether I am quoting him without context. My understanding of what goes on with these companies is that on the one hand they act like a cartel and on the other they do whatever the hell they like. By allowing any sense of removing a freeze on the current charges or changing the current charges, we are going to have multiple Joe Cooneys throughout the country. In doing so, the Minister is sowing bitterness, frustration, disappointment and anger with the Government. The Government could do without this after the recent defeat on water charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> There is no reason the Government should have deferred it until September unless it believed that it was a possibility. Obviously, the Minister has recognised that the possibility of a reaction from the Joe Cooneys of this country is real. Hence the Government has deferred it until September in another classic kick to touch. The Government did the same last year and was supported to the hilt in doing so by Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> The idea that we can regulate these people is something of a ruse. That is why I am opposing the Fianna Fáil motion and why I have tabled an amendment to it. This is not an environmental measure. It is not about the polluter pays principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">A regulator will not deal with the main issue of increases in bin charges. According to Fianna Fáil, a regulator will ensure there is a competitive market. The reality is that the market is the problem, it is not part of the solution. Waste collection was introduced here in the late 1800s to address the problem of cholera on our streets. It is an essential service. Nobody could tolerate uncollected bins throughout the months of July and August. Joe Cooney's bin remains uncollected tonight and there are probably more uncollected bins out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> This problem stems from the policy of privatisation of public services. This particular service was privatised by Fianna Fáil. Had the shoe been on the other foot, it would have been privatised by Fine Gael. Fianna Fáil withdrew from the provision of the service and used the Trojan horse that if people did not pay bin charges, it would lead to privatisation. As other Deputies have pointed out, in significant parts of rural Ireland where there was no campaign against bin charges, privatisation took place well in advance of the privatisation in Dublin city. Now that the service is in private hands, waivers have been abandoned, charges have increased and, crucially, the level of environmental damage remains unacceptably high. We export our recycled waste to China and elsewhere. We have practically zero waste treatment facilities here. The only measure taken in this area was the putting in place of the incinerator at Poolbeg against the will of the people. Three times city councillors voted against the incinerator at Poolbeg and on each occasion they were told by management, at the behest of Government, that it was going ahead regardless. Recently, 11 workers at the incinerator were poisoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> In terms of advances, current recycling levels here stand at 34%, which is above the European average. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, is aware that the European average is 28%. Those advances did not come about through forcing people to pay, rather they were achieved through the provision of facilities. Around the corner from where I live there is a wonderful bring centre at which people can dispose of plastic, cans, paper, bottles and so on. Everybody uses it. Provide the services and people will use them. All we need is a little re-education of the population. People in other countries are incentivised to recycle. When I was a child, one could get money for returning Cidona bottles and so on. Incentivising people does no harm. They could be given a receipt for an amount which they can use in the supermarket against purchases.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> The proposed new system is about boosting the revenues of companies that engage in a race to the bottom in terms of their workers. The Greyhound strike of two years ago was the worst example of a ruthless employer dismissing workers and slashing the pay and conditions of others. The workers who replaced those who had been dismissed were forced to run up and down the street engaging in a piecemeal collection of bins because the quicker they worked the more money they were paid. The company justified this by saying that business is very tight and it is impossible for it to make a profit. Hence the demand for an increase in charges now. It is impossible for us to know whether these companies are making profits because they hide them offshore. Most of these companies are registered in the Isle of Man and elsewhere so we cannot see their profits. I note the Minister is nodding his head. I will give a few examples. Panda Waste last filed public accounts here in 2011, at which time it retained €23.2 million in profits. City Bin last filed accounts here in 2006, at which time it retained profits of €1.7 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_811">Dillon Waste last filed accounts here in 2007, at which time it retained profits of €3.3 million, and Greyhound last filed accounts here in 2009, at which time it retained profits of €8.5 million. How are we supposed to know whether these companies are losing money, are profitable or are going to the wall? There is a proliferation of them. As in the case of Tony Soprano, it was no accident that these companies got involved in waste management. It is a lucrative industry that is very loosely regulated, so much so that when Solidarity-People Before Profit put a motion before a meeting of Dublin City Council last night in respect of the remunicipalisation of the service, it had the support of management. Those in management are tearing their hair out. This year alone, Dublin City Council has spent €1.5 million on the clean-up of illegal dumping. The companies that are making profits from waste do nothing to tackle illegal dumping and so responsibility for it falls to the public services. Management supporting a People Before Profit motion is extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> Our amendment calls on the Government to immediately commission a report on how best to proceed to remunicipalise the domestic waste industry to achieve an environmentally sustainable waste management policy for the country; extend the current price freeze for all waste management users until the report has been completed; and abolish all domestic waste management charges<i>. </i>I am sure the Minister's response will be to ask where we are going to get the money to do that because we are strapped for cash. When I was a councillor, we were very frustrated in trying to meet the demands of local authorities when we did not get the full property tax back despite it having been imposed on people as an austerity measure. The local authority fund has practically disappeared. The guts were slashed out of it. If even a fraction of it were reinstated, waste management services could be remunicipalised - that is a hard word to say but it is an important word. In doing so, we would be doing workers a favour, the environment a favour and, most of all, we would be delivering for ordinary citizens - the Joe Cooneys of this world - the justice that they deserve. Their pockets are not bottomless: they cannot keep digging deeper and deeper to enhance the profits of greedy profiteers over whom we have no control and who will tell Joe Cooney, barefaced on the telephone, that they can do what they like because the Government does not control them. The Minister needs to address the fact that these companies are making a joke of his Ministry.</p>

          <p eId="para_814">I have great respect for the Minister, Deputy Naughten, but in terms of his comments tonight regarding fake news, I despair of the stale and predominantly male vision of the world that looks on us as passive consumers and passive recipients of services, with an absolute refusal to look at evidence that might inform Government policy. The Minister should stop insulting us, telling us about fake news, stating that the market is the only way forward and indicating that he is being forced to regulate a market that, of its nature, cannot be regulated. Some services are essential. They are essential for any civilised, democratic society. We should not seek to divide and conquer on these issues and we should not seek to distinguish the poor people and those who need incontinence sheets from those who do not. This is an essential service. If the Minister does not accept that, perhaps he might consider what was done in Galway, a matter to which I have referred <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House since I was elected.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Galway local authority waste management services was the second last to be privatised. A particular union played a very bad role in that process. We showed what was possible. I will rephrase that - the people of Galway showed politicians and, more importantly, management what was possible. They led us by the nose. When we were told by engineers, whose reports cost millions of euros, that we could not achieve zero waste and that we could only get to 45% recycling, we reached 70% recycling on a shoestring budget on a pilot project. On an ongoing basis, we diverted 56% from landfill on a shoestring budget. The people said, "We are not passive consumers, we are not people to be told, we will tell you, we want to be part of society, we know how important it is", and they led the way. What happened? The service was privatised under Government policy. As my time has expired, I would be delighted to give the Minister all of the facts and figures another time.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">I find the Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour Party and potentially the Green Party position on this issue bizarre. All of them were complicit in the privatisation of our waste services, a service provided for 80 to 100 years through local authorities and introduced specifically to address the issue of cholera, waste on our streets and to prevent the spread of disease. It was a very progressive step forward. Every household had their waste collected from outside their door.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> As has been said already, I and other Deputies who were involved in the anti-bin charges campaign in Dublin in the early 2000s were blamed for privatisation of the service here. Almost 94% of the local authorities that privatised their services did so before the Dublin authority did so. The reason Dublin City Council was so late privatising its service was because people refused to pay by means of a mass non-payment campaign because they knew that once the service was commodified through EU legislation, it would have to be opened up to the market and competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">People knew that they were not the polluters. They were receiving the polluted goods and were then told they had to divide up the waste themselves, in other words, do the work for the waste industry. They had to recycle, put all the waste in the different bins and then pay for those to be collected. People were well aware of what was going on and that these companies were coming into the market to make profits, and that is what they have done. </p>
          <p eId="para_819"> The situation with Greyhound, which locked out its workers in 2014, is disgraceful. Those workers were supposed to have been protected through the transfer of undertakings in that industry, yet they were locked out of their workplace. They lost their jobs because the company said they were eating into its profits and it had to reduce the wages of those people. They were only 30% above what other workers were getting. It was disgraceful that those other workers were getting such low money. Those Greyhound workers were literally taken from the car parks and brought to the industry at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> We have had this debate on the waste industry over and over again. Waste management has to be brought back under local authority control. These prices should be frozen until an investigation takes place into the industry. That was supposed to have happened two years ago and a report on the industry and the cartel nature of these companies was to have been brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> I want to make a specific point about the €75 annual payment to householders for the disposal of incontinence pads. That is not going to the householder; it is going to the waste industry. It is subsidising the waste industry. That waste is going to landfill but it should be incinerated. I received an email from a citizen in which he stated that the HSE supplies 54,000 users with incontinence wear at home or in residential care, and that the HSE supplies 10,000 deliveries to acute hospitals. He further stated this means that if each of the 54,000 users use four pads per day, multiplied by seven days, multiplied by 52 weeks, a staggering 78 million incontinence nappies are going to landfill when they should be incinerated. </p>
          <p eId="para_822"> Fifteen years ago, we should have been examining how we could encourage people to recycle their waste. If people are still putting waste in black bins, they should pay for it, but everything should be put in place. People want to recycle, and they want to go down to their recycling centres to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_823">The Minister, Deputy Naughten's decision to phase out the all-in flat rate charging system for household waste from this autumn is typical of several half-baked policy decisions of this Government when it bothers to make a decision. The Minister knows well that the household waste market is a cartel and that households are at the mercy of a few large operators, some of them foreign based, in this largely dysfunctional market. When the previous Government proposed a similar new crazy pricing regime in SI 24 of 2016, it was beyond belief that there were no maximum lift and flat charges in article 20 of that document. Now after the former Minister, Deputy Coveney's continued inaction to address price gouging by waste companies, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is announcing so-called incentivised pricing options which include a range of standing charges, per lift and per weight charges. Once again, there is no plan to address market failure of any description or even to help change consumer behaviours.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> The reality is that Irish householders have tried hard to address the aims of the EU's waste hierarchy and directives, including prevention, reuse and recycling. It is notable that, with the help of a four-year derogation, we achieved the first two landfill targets of the landfill directive of 1994, that is, the 75% and 50% reductions on 1995 levels. Preliminary data seem to indicate that we have also met the third target of 35% reduction on 1995 levels by July 2016. While landfill capacity has been said to be very low, and I heard one of the Minister's colleagues say that again tonight, we have recently fired up the massive incinerator on the Poolbeg peninsula. There were question marks over whether there would be enough waste for it only a few months ago. Constituents often complain that business needs to do much more to reduce the endless packaging of modern retail products, including food items. Why has the Minister, Deputy Naughten, not taken a single initiative in that regard? Why is the polluter pays principle not being applied all across business, including our ubiquitous food takeaways and coffee shops? I note the Bill introduced by our Green Party colleague addressing the use of plastic cups in coffee shops.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> In the 1990s, as chairperson of the rainbow alliance in Dublin City Council, I strongly opposed the privatisation of household waste. Colleagues and I saw the introduction of waste charges by the then city manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, as a Trojan horse for the full privatisation of household waste. We also feared the price gouging, the unaccountability of waste companies, the non-existent regulation and all the market chaos, which we have experienced and which the Minister is further threatening to inflict on us again, that is all happening. None of the promises of the city and county managers such as Mr. John Fitzgerald and Mr. John Tierney was upheld and ordinary households have paid dearly for that. </p>
          <p eId="para_826"> The former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, told us in September 2015 that the waste management companies were in the "last chance saloon" and that a race to the bottom in waste collection has to end, but nothing has happened. This time last year we had threats of standing charges rises of up to 140% and rises of 200% to 400% by companies such as Greyhound and Thorntons. </p>
          <p eId="para_827"> The previous Fine Gael and successive Fianna Fáil Governments totally failed to implement the promised competitive tendering by district or the promised industry regulation by the city and county councils. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has likewise done nothing to give us a paper even on the economics of household waste pricing. With respect to the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is supposed to become the commission for regulation of utilities, the Minister could simply have added waste management to its remit and brought in some proper regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> My personal strong belief is that household waste management should be renationalised with perhaps a single publicly owned operation reporting to, for example, our four Dublin councils and on a regional basis in other counties. Waste management is a critical issue for householders and should be included in the high local property tax which we pay and which has become a significant local tax. Once again, the Minister is threatening to start another "bintifada".</p>

          <p eId="para_830">I am very happy to speak on this motion but I have a number of concerns about it. I am aware that the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, proposed this legislation as one of his last projects in the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition. Having faced much opposition at the time, this proposal was put on the long finger and was due to be reviewed and a public awareness campaign created around it. Now, here we are, more than a year later with no review or no public awareness campaign. There would have been a number of concerns about the public awareness campaign on bin charges, but because that campaign never happened, the ordinary working public did not have the opportunity to raise these concerns. Therefore, I will raise them on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> In very rural areas like my own constituency of Cork South-West, there is only one waste provider, and in many cases it is KWD. It provides a brilliant service and I will not take that from it. The problem is that it may well sell the company. If it does, a new provider may come in. The proposal is to allow providers to set up their own prices, and that will allow those same providers to exploit their market as they will have a monopoly in these areas. Competition does not exist in rural Cork, as in many places in rural Ireland, so the proposed pricing mechanism will not work there.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> A number of industries and areas in our country are over-regulated but it is important that we have greater regulation of this industry. That would halt the rising level of illegal dumping around our beautiful countryside. Young families, carers of the elderly or the sick, all of whom use diapers or nappies, will suffer increased pressure due to the pay-by-weight proposal. The Department must clearly set out what support these demographics will get to cover this very expensive proposal, one that seems to hit those who are already struggling once again.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> With respect to the local authority dump sites, we are dealing with the dumping and illegal dumping of waste that is destroying our environment. As a councillor in County Cork, I vehemently opposed the closure of some dumps, where their opening times were reduced from six days a week to two and half days a week. Unfortunately, it went unheeded. Now I am being told by people involved in the Tidy Towns and community councils in the greater Schull and Castletownbere area, where these major cuts took place at local authority dump sites, that in the past few years they have collected 2,700 bags of rubbish on the roadside and 500 bags of rubbish on the beaches. These are volunteers such as the chairman, Mr. Tom McCarthy, in Schull, rural social workers and Tidy Town volunteers. That is terrible. There will be further cases of that inflicted on people, whether it will be in Schull or Castletownbere or other places throughout rural Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_834"> We need to find ways to incentivise people to recycle and get rid of their waste in an efficient way. I am not wholly sure that some of these proposals are the best way to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">In February 2016, I called on the then Minister with responsibility for the environment, Deputy Alan Kelly, who never showed his face in the Chamber tonight, to immediately suspend the introduction of increases in the cost of recycling household waste after he signalled at the time that he was set to approve a move that would have seen an additional per-kilo cost, which would have been passed on to families. He was a Labour Party representative and one would wonder where he came from given all that the Labour Party did over the years regarding charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">He did the same with the tyre industry and got away with it. Everyone has been fleeced, there is €3 or €4 on each car tyre. At the time I said that if the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, was as creative in finding ways to address the homelessness crisis as he had been in creating extra charges for households, we might actually have got somewhere but he did not do anything there either. We know the answer he got from the electorate. </p>
          <p eId="para_837"> At the time, a one year review was put in place and now we are talking about another six months. The ball is in the Minister's court now. He is suggesting a watchdog and Deputy Dooley is agreeing with it. I know it is Independence Day in America where they talk about garbage. It is a garbage day. I hope this dog has teeth so that it can get into this garbage and he can chew on it and it will not choke him because I do not believe there is any kind of equal playing field here. People want to recycle, to reuse, they want to be prudent about their waste, but we are not allowing them. I am all for private enterprise and I salute it, and would like to mention one person, Pat Maher of Kedrah in Cahir who did a lot of good work in that area. He met an untimely death recently, dying suddenly as many do. Many others are unscrupulous and want to screw householders and they will do that. It is up to the Minister to put some kind of cap on these providers. It was passed on to him from the last Minister. He has it in his remit and we expect him to do something for it. A watchdog will be toothless. It will not be much good to anyone. We have plenty of regulators. We have one for business. There is a company shedding jobs in Tipperary next week. The competition regulator looked at it. They are toothless and useless and fruitless. They must look after the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> The people want to pay and have a service and want to reuse and recycle. Like Deputy Joan Collins, I know community workers and members of tidy towns committees. We are all going around, sometimes trying to watch people out fly-tipping by night. We try to help local authorities. The amount of dumping is increasing because access to tip heads is gone and then there are charges. It is not a level playing field. We need to start at the schools so that we have the young people on board. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí. We have started there and they are good. It is the older people and fly-by-night cowboys, some of them in criminal gangs, who are taking waste away, cleaning up houses for elderly women and dumping it at the side of the road, leaving county councils and volunteers to pick it up. There is a lot of work to be done to clean up the House here before the Minister starts penalising ordinary workers, not to mention the sick. There is a paltry agreement there for those who are incontinent and use nappies. There is a lot of work to be done here. It needs consultation. The Government has to get it right. We do not want another debacle like the one on water.</p>

          <p eId="para_840">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. It is very unfair of some speakers to call waste collectors gougers. It is very unfair to paint them as gougers and to tar them all with the one brush. I will stand up for the waste collector we have in Kerry, KWD, which has serviced the people of our county and beyond for many years. I do not know what is happening in other counties but we do not have gougers operating in County Kerry.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">KWD also provides a county clean up day which it operates free of charge. Everything that is collected by voluntary groups is heaped up in different towns and villages and it collects it and deals with it. We thank it very much for that. Kerry County Council got out of waste collecting a number of years ago. Since then, KWD and others have operated a very good service and we have no complaints. For the last seven or eight years, KWD has operated a flat rate pay system alongside a pay-by-weight for those who want to pay that way. We will still have to operate the two systems side-by-side because the pay-by-weight will suit some but not others. It may be the fairest for elderly people who would not have much waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> There must be recognition for people who are medically incontinent, and €75 is not enough. Big families with a lot of children cannot cut down on their waste, as hard as they might try. They will have to have some allowance or help as it is already clear that some of these people cannot provide enough food to feed their children. When the Minister suggested that a local authority could provide a waiver system if it wanted, where does he think it will get the money? Will the Government give it that money? Will the Government give the cost of the waiver back to the local authority? The Minister must answer that question. We were told that local authorities could operate the local improvement scheme, and they could but they have no money to do that. This is the same story. The Government collects around €50 million from the 13.5% VAT charged to every customer that waste is collected from.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">I am sharing with Deputies Ryan and Healy. The Social Democrats have submitted two amendments to the Fianna Fáil motion. As we know, waste licences or permits are currently issued by local authorities. Many, if not most, of the large waste collection providers are incorporated in the Isle of Man. There is no point in having a regulator if the information essential to stop price gouging is not available. We argue that in order to qualify for a waste licence or permit, an operator should be required to publish accounts in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_853">A key issue at the moment is that there is a lack of clarity for households. I listened this morning to the Taoiseach describe the waste permit mechanism as some grand scheme of oversight. In fact, it is more like a box ticking exercise. The permit or licensing system needs to be considerably strengthened. The Fianna Fáil motion notes that sudden and unexpected increases in the cost of waste collection will create a disproportionate burden on low income families and must be avoided but the motion does nothing to address the issue other than relying on the market being regulated. The second aspect of our amendment relates to the introduction of a national waiver scheme for households. Any such scheme should involve minimising or segregating waste. An interdepartmental committee was established some years ago to try to devise a waiver system Three separate reports were provided to Government but no decision was made. They need to be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> I accept the need to reduce waste. My constituency has one of four landfills in the country. We see daily convoys of trucks carrying waste not only from different counties, but different provinces. The road system was never designed to carry these types of convoys. Good environmental practice would see waste disposed of close to where it is produced. Ironically, while we have one of four in the country, there is not even a single recycling facility in the constituency. The incinerator will pose the same problem for communities along the route. Policy drives behaviour and reliance on competition to regulate price will mean a continuance of multiple operations in some housing estates in urban areas until one company drives the other out of business. In rural areas, there simply will not be the competition because of the dispersed nature of the population. It will not be a question that there will be a cartel but households will be invited to take it or leave it.</p>

          <p eId="para_855">There are certain things about which we are in agreement. We want to stop putting material into landfill. That is something we agree with but we do not think that is sufficient. We need to go further, particularly in the promotion of recycling and reusing and creating a new circular economy that can create jobs as well as improving our environment. Our amendments today are geared towards steering the country in that direction and we look for support from other parties, which I have heard today say they want to push recycling. We need to do something about it. While I welcome some of the measures in other amendments, such as a national regulator looking at price gouging, we need to go further than that and strengthen the role of local government in this area, giving it back real control over how waste collection is done rather than letting the market decide as though it is a consumer product, as the Government seems to imply. It is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">More than anything else I hope this might be an opportunity for us to seek a common purpose with any and all parties in supporting the waste reduction Bill that we introduced in this House some weeks ago. It is very simple and it was supported by a letter last week from 17 of the leading environmental organisations, including bodies like VOICE Ireland, which has done much work in this area of thinking about how to reduce waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> There are mechanisms to cut waste at source through regulation by stipulating there cannot be a wasteful plastic and paper cup but rather it should be compostable. It would keep something out of the black bin and it would cost nothing; it would save people money. Similarly, giving money back for a bottle would save 2.5 billion plastic bottles per year going to landfill, according to VOICE Ireland. If we can get them out of the system, it is a way to start protecting against landfill use. It is a win-win scenario for the householder, who would be getting money back. Everybody would be buying into what would be a step in the right direction in the management of recycling.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> Whatever about this debate and the way the vote goes, I hope this emphasis on the waste recycling and management system might see cross-party support, with parties willing to sign up to pieces of legislation and put them through the Dáil so we can demonstrate to householders that we are not just charging them but looking to give back money. We must show that we are cutting out waste at source, which is the best way to go in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_859">I was a member of Clonmel Corporation when the authority introduced domestic waste charges at £5 per year. I opposed the charge on the basis that it was the thin end of the wedge and it would lead to charges of £300 or £400 per family. I also argued the waiver scheme for low-income families and those with health problems would be abolished over time. I stated that as sure as night follows day, it would lead to the privatisation of the waste collection service. Of course, I was ridiculed and laughed at, with one councillor firing a box of matches at me across the table and saying the cost would not even come to the price of a box of matches per week. I was proven correct on all counts. The privatisation of domestic waste has been an unmitigated disaster, both for the public and the environment. It has led to increased costs and it has fleeced low and middle-income families while duplicating services and producing widespread dumping.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> This pay-by-weight proposal is not about recycling. We already have higher recycling rates than the European Union average, and we have already exceeded EU targets for electrical and electronic waste. This proposal is about making more profit for private companies and heaping further austerity on low and middle-income families. There is no provision in this system, for example, for the reduction of the large amount of packaging associated with modern production. Many private companies operating in this sector are engaged in a race to the bottom with regard to wages and conditions of employment. The State is forced to subsidise these very profitable companies through the family income supplement. Privatisation has been an abject failure and we must now hand back domestic waste collection services to local authorities to operate as a public service and abolish all domestic waste charges.</p>

          <p eId="para_861">The first matter for clarification is the Taoiseach's statement today that it could be up to 15 months before this kicks in. From what I am hearing around the country - I know other Deputies will speak to this later - some of the providers have already told customers that when the contracts are up, they are ready to go. It is a matter of divide and conquer.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> There is much consternation around the country, especially in rural areas. As everybody knows, if one lives in a rural part of Ireland, it costs more when compared with the more numerous houses in urban areas. If a pay-by-weight system is used and bills increase, the amount of dumping in rural areas would increase. It is human nature. When the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, announced the changes to waste collection some time ago, any rural Deputy going around the country could see the by-roads and bog roads filling again. The Minister put money into trying to solve that problem but, unfortunately, it was not solved. Many community groups put much work into trying to make areas better but, unfortunately, with the proposed system, we will see the same thing again. The councils need to ensure the recycling centres get more resources to encourage people to use them. With regard to brown bins being provided where there are more than 500 people in an area, does this refer to a town, a parish or village?</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> I have listened to many motions being debated. A motion was passed that we would not sell the shares in AIB but a few weeks later we read in the newspapers that the shares were to be sold anyway. I do not know the value of a motion. Nevertheless, it is clear that the message followed by people in all parts of Ireland and the majority in this Dáil is that this is not a good idea. Will Fianna Fáil bring the Government to the top of the hill before letting it slide down again or will we finally, for once in our lives, stand up and be counted as politicians?</p>

        <speech by="#JohnLahart" eId="spk_386">
          <from>Deputy John Lahart<recordedTime time="2017-07-04T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_864">The Government’s proposals have caused anxiety among customers of the bin companies. A constituent in Templeogue already reports that Greyhound is increasing his black bin lift charges by 23% from €8.50 to €10.50. This matter is striking fear and anxiety into people on low or no incomes and who are reliant on State supports to help them live from week to week. Flat charges enable predictability for vulnerable households and confidence that their bills are static from week to week, allowing them to budget responsibly.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> I requested figures today from the housing department of South Dublin County Council seeking information on the number of rental accounts in arrears in the council’s administrative area among its tenant base, which numbers about 12,000 householders. I did this to illustrate the kind of pressure low-income households are under and 60% of tenants of one variety or another are in arrears. These are some of the most vulnerable and challenged communities in Ireland living in my constituency. There are large communities of senior people relying on their life-earned State pension to enable them to live from week to week. Any upward changes made to the demands on their small allowances causes much anxiety and leads to increased hardship. There is also a large cohort of middle Ireland who simply cannot afford a financial shock in any given month, so delicately balanced are their incomes and budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> The Minister needs to take a long look at the practices of the main players in the bin collection industry in Dublin because there are sufficient grounds for public disquiet in the manner in which some of these companies operate to such a degree that it is essential that a regulator be appointed. My colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, wrote to the Minister in October last year and received no response when he alerted the Government to his concerns on a number of issues that had been brought to his attention by whistleblowers with a keen knowledge of the Dublin market. Deputy Cowen requested that the Department, as the overseer of the waste industry, would commission investigations into matters of an anti-competitive nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> Deputy Cowen alerted the Minister to the need for a widespread investigation into the extent of collusion between waste operators and barriers to entry in the waste market in the Dublin region. Why was this? Dublin waste operators are heavily reliant on each other's facilities and are consequently forced to enter commercial relationships with each other that ultimately diminish competition. If Dublin operators were not as reliant on each other, it is highly likely more competition would exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> One of the major barriers to entry into the domestic waste market in Dublin for new operators is having outlets for their waste and recyclables. This is particularly the case with regard to the Dublin City Council owned mixed dry recycling facility, which is leased and operated by the market leader, the Panda waste collection company. There is an argument that an independent body should be appointed to run this facility, which is by far the largest in the region, to encourage more competition in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> The Minister was also alerted to the issue of evidence of price collusion when three major waste companies in Dublin announced massive price hikes all on the same day last year before the new charging regime was suspended, indicating a high probability of collusion. There is no legitimate reason the introduction of the pay-by-weight regulations should have led to price hikes by all companies on the same day. In the absence of real competition, providers saw an opportunity to take advantage of consumer uncertainty and to impose price hikes.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> There are concerns in the public arena that need to be addressed. These were brought to the Minister's attention by Fianna Fáil and we are still awaiting a response a month later as to whether they are being investigated.</p>

          <p eId="para_872">These conspiracy theories must be examined. There are four major bin collection companies in Dublin which has a population of 1.5 million people. When was the last time householders in Dublin were approached by a waste company offering to compete for their business? There is evidence that these companies are buying up smaller companies throughout the country. The raids on insurance bodies were mentioned earlier. If the bin collection companies in Dublin are to avoid comparison with "The Sopranos" they must be investigated in a similar manner so public confidence can be upheld and hard-pressed consumers can be protected from price gouging.</p>

          <p eId="para_873">I commend the many environmental organisations, including Tidy Towns, green schools and the local authorities, for their valued efforts to ensure we have some from of waste control and education in the whole process.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> The polluter pays principle has always been the cornerstone of waste management plans and the inevitable pay-by-weight regime is slowly but surely starting to bite. Fianna Fáil is of the view that the pay-by-weight system should not be introduced, particularly in areas where there is little or no competition, until a regulator is put in place to monitor the regimes and a fair price per kilo is set across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> We have all said that 50% of households are already paying by weight, so their costs should not be subject to any increase. We need to work with and educate the remaining 50%. The objective should be reducing people’s bills. If the Minister believes in the system he is proposing, he should be able to give a guarantee that if those people do the right thing in terms of what he is saying is required, they will not see an undue hike in their charges. The objective should also be reducing our waste as a society by nurturing good recycling habits. Irish people have a great track record in adopting new good habits, as we saw not just in the plastic bag issue but using reusable shopping bags.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> It should be possible to establish a reasonable cost for disposal of waste that allows for a percentage profit for waste companies. A regulator should be capable of ensuring unscrupulous profiteering by waste management companies is not allowed over the interests of the householder.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Ireland has a serious situation looming on the horizon regarding landfill diversion targets. Increased recycling could see us divert another 35% of waste away from landfill. Some of the steps could include the minimisation of packaging waste at the point of manufacturing, offering more loose food products that are packaging free, and encouraging retailers to take back unwanted packaging. Our spokesperson, Deputy Dooley, cited the example of the size of the packaging of a new mobile phone. There is no reason the consumer should have to pay to get rid of that waste. We must encourage consumers to think before they purchase and only to purchase what will be consumed.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> I am acutely aware of the growing fly tipping problem throughout the country. However, the problem is not just fly tipping. In two townlands in my parish, the biggest ever illegal dumps were discovered. I know the cost of that as against all the work being done by the various community groups. The consumer must also be cognisant of those smaller services offering to dispose of larger goods and should check their waste disposal licence as many of those services are not licensed and the material ends up being dumped in a ditch.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> I could speak on this topic all night, but I wish to give my colleagues an opportunity to contribute.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">I thank my colleague, Deputy Dooley, for bringing forward this very important motion. The position is clear. The Government has had 12 months to deal with this issue and it has completely failed to address the problems around waste collection. Ultimately, it has failed to protect households which are now being exposed to higher prices and a raft of new stealth charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> The Taoiseach talks about the new so-called hidden fiscal space and that he wants to give tax cuts to the people who follow a similar early morning regime to him, but we know that with the regime the Minister is trying to introduce, that will be gone with the raft of new bin charges facing people. There is a lack of clarity, education and awareness about the new charging system for many hard-pressed families who will inevitably pay more.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> This is an issue that is causing concern and distress for many individuals and families. I have been made aware that one waste collector, Panda, is now imposing different charges, fees, fines and penalties, seemingly at will. Under a new agreement and terms and conditions it has proposed, it has said it will charge between €10 and €25 if a customer accidentally puts the wrong item in the wrong bin. One Pringles can put in a green bin could result in a fine of between €10 and €25. This is outrageous and the Minister is doing nothing about it. We have a toothless watchdog. We need a fully financed regulator such as the one we proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> The agreement also orders the customer to reimburse Panda for all expenses and costs if there is any delay to bins being collected, and the agreement also gives the company “sole discretion” over the price of service. As my colleague, Deputy Lahart, mentioned, we are giving an effective cartel sole discretion over the setting of price. This is a €1 billion industry that requires regulation and intervention from Government around pricing.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> Most concerning of all, Panda states that its representatives shall have access to the premises where the bins are located. If there are any delays due to access being delayed or unavailable, Panda will be reimbursed by customers. Panda is giving itself more power to enter property and premises than that available to gardaí. That is outrageous in what is a draft agreement and terms and conditions of which customers are not aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> We know that waste collection companies are exploiting the Government’s inaction and are bringing in whatever hidden charges and penalties they wish. This is a cash cow industry with unlimited companies. We are uncertain of their profits because they do not publish their accounts. It is important we have proper regulation and oversight. When we are talking about a €1 billion industry for a public utility, we need to intervene. We must do the right thing. This is the Minister's opportunity to do that, but giving the likes of Panda sole discretion to set the rules in the market will undermine waste collection for many years to come. This is the Minister's chance to get off the fence and deal with this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_886">Twelve months ago, there was a plan to introduce pay-by-weight per kilogram as the only pricing model which would be available to customers of household waste collection. This caused some concern as it appeared that certain collectors were using the new initiative as an opportunity to increase prices and the Government made a decision not to introduce pay-by-weight at that time. A voluntary agreement was reached with waste operators to hold the current prices and plans for 12 months. The potential introduction of pay-by-weight was to be reviewed to inform decisions in regard to the charging arrangements beyond 1 July 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> The Government has decided to proceed with a new framework that will give waste collectors the flexibility to continue to offer, or to introduce, a range of incentivised pricing options which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste while choosing the service price offering that best suits their circumstances and allows them to manage their costs. These options include elements or combinations of per lift, per kilogramme, weight bands, weight allowances and standing charges. This offers the widest choice to consumers to help them manage their costs. Approximately half of households are already on these types of offerings, so the public is familiar with these options.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> Mandatory nationwide per kilogramme charging is not being introduced. However, all-in flat charging for household waste will start to be phased out by waste collectors as customers renew or enter new service contracts from September onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> It should be noted that the existing level of waste charges, which people are seeking to preserve, is the result of an open and competitive market. The 12-month industry voluntary arrangement essentially held those prices at that level while the Government reviewed the introduction of pay per kilogram charging. The new arrangements announced by the Minister encourage innovation and competition between operators and enhance choice for consumers. They do not reduce the competitive pressures on waste collectors to ensure they are offering competitive services.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> An annual support of €75 will be introduced for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence. This will help people meet the average annual cost of disposal of incontinence products. The details and arrangements of this support will be finalised later this year after further consultation with the stakeholder groups. Already there has been a considerable amount of consultation with the groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> The amount of waste sent to landfill has increased in the past two years. In 2016, there was insufficient capacity to dispose of residual waste and emergency powers were invoked by the regulatory authorities to make additional landfill capacity available. As the Taoiseach said today and as Deputy Dooley should know, no one wants to see new landfills opening in their constituencies. Many communities have been through that experience. We went through it in our county a number of years ago and it was very difficult for people in localities.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> All waste collectors will be required to start rolling out food organic brown bins to all communities nationwide with a population greater than 500 people. This will help more households divert waste away from their standard black bins.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> An information and awareness campaign will also be implemented by the Department and the regional waste management planning offices later this summer and autumn. It will take account of the new approach to charging.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> Ireland faces real challenges to meet its European obligations in regard to waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Ireland has an obligation under the waste framework directive to recycle 50% of household waste by 2020. New EU circular economy targets currently being negotiated in Brussels include a proposal to limit landfill to 10% of municipal waste generated by 2030. On the other hand, there are significant economic, employment and climate benefits arising from preparing for reuse, recycling and recovery of waste as opposed to disposing of waste in landfill.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> A principle of national waste policy since 1998 has been that the level of waste charges should vary according to usage. Phasing out of all-in flat rate charges for residual or "black bin" household waste is consistent with national Government waste policy. Landfill is the least environmentally sustainable waste management method. Exploiting the potential of waste as a resource – less to landfill, more prevention, recycling and recovery – will contribute to the creation of employment and alternative energy options. Households on plans which have a variable charge element, such as per lift or some form of weight or usage-based charging, generate significantly less waste. Waste collection in Ireland is serviced by private companies, which operate in a competitive market, and the State has no role in setting prices. All decisions on the pricing of individual services have been a matter for waste collection companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> In recognition of some of the concerns raised, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, proposes to set up a pricing monitoring unit that will provide monthly reports on pricing developments and will commission an in-depth analysis on the operation of the household waste market by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission by year-end. This will provide an evidence base to establish a regulator to prevent price gouging. One aim is to assist householders to both reduce and segregate their waste. The alternative is to consider new landfills or expand the use of current landfill sites, which I do not believe anyone would welcome or propose. In addition, we need to allow the 67 collectors the flexibility to offer householders a range of charging options. Households, as consumers, choose the option that suits their circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> With regard to the issues concerning unnecessary waste, Repak is the authorised compliance scheme for packaging waste in Ireland. In 2016, Repak funded the recovery and recycling of 795,000 tonnes of household and commercial packaging waste. We have seen the work that took place in recent years in regard to reducing the level of Easter egg packaging, for example, although more could be done on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> A number of Deputies raised the question of companies with offshore accounts. From 2017 offshore companies operating here must publish their accounts and this applies also to waste companies. I commend the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on establishing the task force to reduce waste packaging that shoppers bring home from supermarkets, which is important and something I would like to see progressed. Some operators have bin sharing facilities for customers. I believe the potential of bin sharing will grow under the new proposals, particularly for those with low levels of waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> With the growth in our economy, there is a growth in the level of waste produced, and given more stringent EU targets, we need to improve recycling and composting and to reduce black bin rates. Even with the Poolbeg incinerator, we have and will have serious capacity issues in terms of waste management and landfill. I believe we must act now.</p>

          <p eId="para_901">Fianna Fáil supports the enactment of a waste reduction task force and a waste regulator that will ensure fair practice within the waste sector and prevent price gouging for all households. However, a pay-by-weight bin charge initiative has not been fleshed out in full, leaving us with more questions than answers. The Government has tried to rush through a pay-by-weight bin charge but with little transparency as to what the pricing system and charging system will entail. The previous Minister promised to raise public awareness on the matter and introduce dual pricing in order that people could compare the cost of pay-by-weight relative to a fixed charge system, all of which has not transpired. Last year, bin companies threatened to considerably increase their prices, disseminating fear across the country. Households throughout the country still share that anguish and fear.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> I want to bring to the Minister's attention an issue I have often raised with him, namely, illegal dumping. My biggest fear is that such illegal dumping will flourish and, as usual, rural Ireland will be at the coalface. The constituency of Cavan-Monaghan has seen numerous incidents involving the dumping of tyres, domestic waste, mattresses and all the rest but its local authorities lack the proper resources to deal with it. There is one person in County Cavan and perhaps two in County Monaghan to deal with this issue across the entire constituency. I ask the Minister not to do anything that will encourage illegal dumping as it is a huge problem nationwide at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_903">This is a difficult situation for the Minister, which I acknowledge. Everybody in this House has to realise this matter must be faced up to. That is why, in our own election promises, we opted for pay-by-weight, and we acknowledge that, although not for green bins. There has been much talk in the House this evening about Fianna Fáil going up to the top of the hill and then coming down. We went to the top of the hill and we got a regulator from the Minister, so we came down with something. That is far better than the people who stay at the bottom of the hill, look up and say, "No, we will not do anything". I think we are playing a major role in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> There is a responsibility on us all. In my own area, the Minister got money to help clean up a massive illegal dump in a beautiful area that people use for walking. This issue has to be dealt with. We must commend the many people in our society who are doing unbelievable work to clean up our countryside. This is the way I read the public: they want this matter dealt with but they want it dealt with properly. In dealing with it, we must ensure we support those who need assistance, such as larger families and those with incontinence issues, for whom the €75 payment should be increased. This problem must be dealt with properly. Fianna Fáil will be bringing forward further suggestions. I hope we will get a proper policy in place that will address all of the issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_905">Rural communities will be very exposed by this plan if it goes ahead as proposed. It could hit very hard in places where having two bins is the only option available to people. I understand the Minister proposes that three bins would only be compulsory in places where there are more than 500 households. I do not believe there should be any limit or cap and it should be open to every householder to have the opportunity to recycle. The "two bins only" option means that people in rural communities would be faced with having to put in compostable material and paying more to dump it. That should not be the case and everybody should be given an option in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> Having the regulator is very important and is necessary to ensure there will not be price gouging. When I was a member of Cork County Council, it introduced a pay-by-weight system throughout the county. One issue that came forward was that many householders were concerned about what they were going to pay because they could not see what the end-of-year cost was going to be. Certainty was needed and many of them moved over to alternative providers and away from the council at the time. There needs to be certainty and dual pricing must be in place. It was supposed to be introduced earlier this year but it has not happened in many places. Those companies are blackguarding the Minister. He needs to stand firm with them and ensure they are protecting customers and householders around the country, and not blackguarding customers as they have been.</p>

          <p eId="para_907">The Minister's willingness to compromise on the Fianna Fáil proposal to establish a regulator is welcome and, as such, is a step in the right direction. However, there obviously is a period of time in which the regulator must be established. I hope that in tandem with his work with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which will provide the monthly reports, the Minister will begin the procedures associated with the establishment of the regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">He may rest assured that if this does not happen, Fianna Fáil will bring its own Bill to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> Notwithstanding the Government's commitments last year to attempt to resolve this issue over a protracted period, nothing happened. I accept that responsibility transferred from one Minister to another, so it is not entirely on the Minister's shoulders. If, however, the same lethargy is holding sway again, we will proceed and move to bring our own Bill forward. I ask the Minister to use his contacts in the waste collection sector to seek to continue the moratorium on price increases for that period of time. The Taoiseach indicated earlier today that he does not expect to see any change in the charging structure for the next 15 to 18 months. This gives adequate time for the report the Minister will seek to be compiled and for the regulator to be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Unfortunately, Sinn Féin has failed to understand the marketplace that exists at present. It seems to think the decision that was taken effectively removed the capacity of waste operators to increase charges. A number of the 68 waste collection operators increased their prices over the past 12 months. Sinn Féin would like to present this as being some kind of cataclysmic event but it is not. The free market has dictated that some have raised their prices. If Sinn Féin was as serious about protecting consumers as it says it is, it would support the introduction of the regulator, as set out by the Minister, because it is in the long-term interest to ensure that price gouging does not take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae would be wise to look at the record of what was said. No one referred to any of those involved in the waste collection sector as being gougers. Price gouging is different in meaning to the colloquial term "gouger". What was said was that there are some unscrupulous waste collectors in the sector. Nobody ever mentioned the Deputy's local operator. If I were to speak about promoting the interests of parties in this regard, Clean Ireland, which is based in Clare, is one of the finest in terms of embracing modern technology, collecting on the basis of pay-by-weight and spearheading the introduction of new technologies. It is outstanding. If the rest of the sector was half as well versed in the development of technology as the O'Donoghue brothers were in developing Clean Ireland, there would be no need for us to be here today. Sadly, there are some who reside outside the group that advocates for the industry and do not participate in it. We must put that kind of a structure in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> Sinn Féin would also be wise to recognise there is a compromise and the Minister proposes to ensure consideration is given to families experiencing financial hardship. This should be addressed as part of a social welfare Bill rather than attempting to do it through the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. However, since the Minister is responding on behalf of the Government and this is a Government amendment, I am pleased we achieved this level of success.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> In so far as is possible, the price freeze must, with the support of the mainstream industry, remain in place. We must ensure that, in tandem with the work the Minister has undertaken with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, we begin the process to establish a regulator and that we all work towards the main objective, which is to change the behaviour of how we dispose of our waste in a manner that gives certainty to consumers so that if they make this shift and decide to participate in the better management of waste, they will not be penalised and gouged by unscrupulous operators.</p>
